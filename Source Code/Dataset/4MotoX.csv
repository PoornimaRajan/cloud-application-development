"I personally love this phone. I typically get the Samsung Galaxy Note; but when I had it, within less than a year the battery started giving out on me. It was ridiculous to the point where I could only use it for a couple of hours. So, I decided to get this phone because I didn't want to dish out a lot of money for a phone. To me, this is reasonably priced. It has great features to it. The seller to me was the camera and the screen size. Anyone would fall in love with the camera quality.The downside of this phone, in my opinion, is the dense feeling you get with the phone. It kinda feels like a brick. Also, it can get pretty hot. So remember to manage the apps you open. And, maybe I'm just nitpicking, the charger isn't a USB and USB adapter. I kind of wished it was. Other than that, it's pretty good."
Great phone best camera my wife has had. Bought it for her as a gift and she loves it. I my be replaced.LOL
perfect phone I just love it buy it your be glad you did.
"This is my second smartphone. Compared to the gnex this phone is wonder. I got it activated for Verizon. Battery life on this phone lasts me three days, but I do use greenify app."
"Excellent, working as expected. No issues during shipping"
After a month the screen had to receive at least 30 touches to get a movement. not good at all that I do not live in the USA. Camera is excellent though. I can navigate the screen sometimes after 30 minutes. I need them to send me a working phone.
"This is the best phone I have ever owned, tons of features and the none of the manufacturer bloat ware that you usually have to spend days to extract. Extremely fast, fantastic display, excellent battery life. The only down side is storing music on the SD card without utilizing the SD card for additional hard space needed by the phone. I have been using this phone for the last year and I have had very few issues. I recommend adding a case immediately. If it falls and lands on one of the corners it will shatter and become worthless. Then you wouldn't have to buy a second one like me."
The best phone you can buy for $300.
This is the best for the price
"I already liked this phone A LOT, but today it slipped out of my pocket while cleaning the gutters and fell 2 STORIES to the CONCRETE patio below and not a scratch on it -- works perfectly well (had a cheap $8 Cimo case on it - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0115B4ZJY/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). The phone is big, bright, fast, has a battery that lasts all day long and costs less than half of what some other phones cost."
"Excellent Value phone. I do love it. Fast, beautiful screen, good sound, camera, moto features. Best Android phone for me so far (of 4)."
"I love this phone, never had a Moto before and didn't know what to expect but I bought this one and I'm in love. Changing between apps, playing games and going through my favorite social apps can be done without the phone ever getting slow. Also the camera is awesome! I love it has Android OS and I love having a big screen. I'm super happy with my Moto X."
I was sceptical about buying this phone but I am so glad I did !
GREAT PICS
"This phone worked for 3 months, now have the screen's touch capability is gone completely. The lower half of the screen has decided not to work whatsoever so I can't even sign in. I'm very disappointed because that's 300 dollars that I thought I was putting into a quality product."
Everything perfect. Arrived on time and in perfect conditions. Just like described.

"Excelent!!!,"
"This phone has great graphics and a fair battery life. I liked mine so much I ordered one for my 2 kids and my spouse. For the price, this is an excellent phone."
"really great features for the price, totally worth it!"
Works great just as advertised.... Just wish it had more internal storage or at least a microsd slot
its a great product for the cost.
Its awesome. Just wish T-Mobile had better coverage.
"Even though the newer 2014 version is available this phone is a solid option if you want a great phone at an affordable price mainly because you get awesome premium features (and gimmicks) like touchless control and the great batery life, it also includes nice apps that make the user experience great. It may not be the best phone right now but it is an awesome bang for the buck and i enjo using it alot."
Brand new cellphone. Arrived as expected!
Little disappointed this was suppose to be a new phone but I can tell is used by charging port cosmetic wear and tear in the plastic surrounding it .
"Great, exactly as it was described"
"It is okay. Price is good, the phone is good to use"
The one I got had the AT@T logo and black spot (white case) on the back and scratches on the side where the SIM card goes. Looked like it has been used. The seller advertised this phone as new so... it goes back to the seller
Very good
haibucuo
"Sorry, it is not at all what I expected. When the seller implied it was unlocked, at the price she was asking, I thought I was getting a real good deal on an unlocked moto X. Everyone already knows that coming from Verizon, they are sim unlocked. I'll be returning this item tomorrow because I have already found one on EBay for less money and it really is a factory unlocked phone. I'm very sorry but I have just been really upset since I took this phone out of the box."
Bought this phone for my wife to replace her AT&T Moto X that she dropped and cracked the screen. Although the box said it was the AT&T XT1058 model it was actually the XT1060 which is for Verizon. Luckily it was sim unlocked so she could still use it but I needed to manually change many of the settings to get the data to work. If it wasn't for the fact that I'm a phone nerd she wouldn't be able to use it and it would have to go back.
great
great phone speakers a little muted but this phone is everything I expected. Great fast Phone!
good
"This Moto X and G line of phones gets top o the line in my book.Especially at a reasonable price.It does whatever I want and well too.This is ""like new"" condition. And it certainly is like new.Motorola just seemed to be hanging on,but being acquired by Google gives them the edge. BUY ONE..GREAT DEAL."
Very good phone.. Not quite as good as the second gen but with the lolipop 5.1 upgrade it made some of the features exactly the same
"Couldn't be happier with this phone. Now that its a couple years old, I got it for around $200.At this price, its a steal, and it still holds up to modern phone very well. I upgraded from a Moto G due to it dragging while multitasking.Really, I don't have any cons for this phone. I couldn't be happier."
I am very disappointed with this purchase. was not sealed packaging and accessories are not original. seems a used phone.
Quick and great deal. thanks
very good
volume too low
Excellent !
"I love this phone, best phone I've ever owned. I bought it used and must say that the seller sent the phone quickly and it was in very good condition."
Amazing phone I love it!
"Quick, reliable phone"
beatiful
Good phone!
"I asked for a black cellphone and it only came with a white charger. I thought it came with earphones, also. The box wasn't sealed. Works fine, though."
"so far I thinks this is a good device, the only thing I dont like is when the phone gets hot ( few times) and the battery is eaten, would the engineers some time in this future finish with this kind of issues ? despite that ( and I hate when is happen) is a good phone"
"If you don't need the customization or the free Chromecast available at motorolla website, then buy it here since Amazon prime rocks and this is a very nice phone. No problems getting it onto AT&T."
"First of all, always on listening is a godsend for the car, and for folks like me who constantly lose their phone. The processor is crazy fast, the cameras are both great, and I love that there is almost no bloatware. Even with GPS and Wi-Fi always on, I have yet to run down the battery. What bloatware is on the phone is from Google, whose kool-aid I have thoroughly drunk.However, I'm frustrated that storage isn't expandable, and the price point seems a bit too high."
"I would use this company in the future! and I would also recommend it to others. I was nervous about what I would end up with and how fast it would ship. I was impressed they shipped the phone signature required, in spending that kind of money on a phone it gives you added security knowing others couldn't steel it out of mail box or left at door. I absolutely love the phone and all its features. I tried to hook it up with straight talk phone service and was not impressed with their service at all! They said I would get the best coverage for their plan with an AT&T unlocked phone, but they could not even get the data to work on this phone. They told me that there was something wrong with my phone and probably not completely unlocked. So I took it to T-Mobile and they put their own sim card, and everything worked! no data problem at all! and reassured me the phone was unlocked. The only thing I don't care for in these phones( Moto x)they don't give you the option to change the battery very easy! But I found out most phones are being made that way now due to type of batteries they use. I think the Galaxy's are the only ones now that make it easy to replace the battery."
"I specifically chose to purchase this phone because I liked the sound of several of the unique features, and I do not regret the purchase. The things I love:- The blinking time and alerts feature. You wouldn't think it would seem like a big deal to have to push the button to un-sleep the screen, but being able to glance at the phone like a watch is very nice.- The voice recognition feature. I find the actual voice recognition to be quite good - it rarely misinterprets what I say. The only frustrating part about it is that sometimes it just doesn't do what I tell it to do, I'll wake it up and give it a command and it'll just kind of stare at me slack-jawed, to the extent that a phone can do such a thing. Trying to get it to start up navigation to a certain address seems to be particularly problematic. But other times, I can command ""Ok Google, navigate to 123 Main Street!"" and it'll be off to the races.- Battery life is very good and it charges lightning fast.I consider all of the above to be major pros. I have a bunch of little minor cons which are just quibbles about user interface. There is only one major con: the camera. I may be spoiled, but I'm used to using the Samsung Galaxy S4 or a family member's iPhone. Either one of those cameras GREATLY outperforms the one in this phone. I am no camera pro, but I enjoy using my phone's camera a lot, and take a lot of memento and shared photos with it. I am amateur at photography and for an actual camera I use a SONY NEX model. If you like taking photos and want high quality, this might not be the phone for you. I just find its ability to deal with light very lacking - not just low light situations, but even situations like light sources coming in from the side and so forth, and many of the photos appear slightly blurred or overexposed to me. Galaxy S4 took lovely photos - almost like what I'd expect for a regular trusty little point and shoot style camera rather than a camera phone. Anyway, that's my gripe and I wanted to share it in case others find it useful.By the way, this phone uses a standard mini USB charger style - same one as my Amazon Kindle and my Galaxy S4, which is extremely handy (and you know you'd never have this happen with an iPhone). I bought the Bear Motion case for it here in a snazzy green, it's sort of a textured surface case and it's very neat and has held up better than I'd have expected. I've used this phone for about 4 months."
"I have owned iPhone 4, 4s , 5 and 5 s . I have also owned GS4 and Nokia Lumia 1020. Finally I am found this phone and I loved it."
This really is a great phoneMet every expectation I had for a good priceAndroid's newest version is user friendly and google now is just something amazing!
"This is a great phone. It is the perfect size, it fits in the hand so well. I do have a small TPU case on it, which sucks as it make the phone bigger, but I tried two different cases and kept the one that was noticeably thinner, and had a tighter better fit.The 720 screen is perfect, look at the reviews and the benchmarks. Having a 720 screen instead of 1080, lets the phone get better battery life, and makes a weaker cpu work, about as good as the highest end cpus. The screen is also beautiful amoled. It is an amazing screen with amazing colors. My GF has the Iphone 5S and while the screen is very nice and has realistic colors, it looks so dull and boring compared to my screen.Battery life is amazing, once you turn off all the ""junk"" that google wants you to use. Phones have location services, and wifi, and etc, etc, they have a lot going on. I turn off as much stuff as possible, no location service, no GPS, no wifi unless I use it. My phone goes 24 hours between charges, or more. I could get 48 hours with minimal use, but I often plug it in every night anyway. Now I am a lite user, this is with basic use, of course if you want to stream youtube videos over wifi, your battery will die quickly. But I can watch a couple of hours of youtube on wife and use only 20%.Touch-less control seems cool, but I do not use it. Active notifications are great, I love not having to push any buttons to check new texts."
"Smart, smooth, bright, light, slim and intuitive. I had a N8 till now and for the last 6 years. But it doesn't have a memory card slot..."
I was using Nexus 5 for a year and thought of buying a compact phone. This feels very good in hands and don't see any issue with speed / display quality compared to Nexus 5. I know camera is not good in this phone as well as loud speaker which I don't use regularly.Will have to wait few months for 5.0 update... anyways I don't like lollipop!
"Clon phone I knew it at the moment I unboxed it, I know now why it has no warranty the phone is not working anymore, all started with the microphone not working and then the screen and so on as. I have a friend who owns one but I guess he is a little smater he got his from Motomaker.com a little more expensive but authentic and with guaranty."
This is the first time buying an item from MAC TECH and am really disappointed and their are some missed accessories in the product and damaged......
Not new. Open box that was poorly re-taped. Not even the right (unlocked) model. Returned.
Very happy with my new phone!
excellent phone but did not come released
Everything great!
Excelente producto.
It's a good phone and easy to use. It hasn't been difficult to transition from my previous phone to this one at all.
"I received the phone box in shrink wrap. The phone was in mint condition. The charger and cable do have Motorola logo on them but they're black, as opposed to white shown in the picture. It didn't come with its own sim card ejection tool either so you gotta find yourself a needle. Another weird thing was, when I turn on the phone, it didn't prompt me through the whole ""setting up"" process. It simply went to the home screen, as if someone already set it up before me. Back then I didn't think it was that big of a deal, yet turned out it was. Before I get into it, just want to first say that, there's pretty much nothing about the phone that I dislike. The phone is fast, snappy and very smooth when it comes to handling multi-tasking and such. The front camera has pretty decent, warm-colored, clear quality. The back camera is not the best i've used, yet not terrible either. Clear enough but not impressive. You get the idea...The call quality is great. Coming from a Nexus 4 user, the call quality is much better than my old phone. When I'm on speaker, the person on the other end don't even realize it. The quality is very clear with very minimal of background noises. The phone is 16gb as promised and NOT pre-loaded with bunch of useless apps that you'll end up deleting. The first day of using the phone I was very happy about it. Until I found one major problem about it, it has no mobile internet. I tried turning the mobile data button on and off several times, tried rebooting the phone numerous times. There's still NO mobile data. I went on internet and read several forum where people are discussing the same problems. It turned out I don't have the proper APN (Access Point Name) for this phone. My current carrier is T-mobile. And I've used several unlocked devices before with T-mobile and never had any problems. So this one had me do some extra work before I can get access to the internet I paid for. Considering that I like the phone so much, I was willing to do as much as I can to fix this problem. I started to manually input the APN for T-mobile USA. And for some odd reason, every single time I finish inputting every field and hit ""SAVE"", the thing never saves. Then I found out that I cannot make any changes for this single field called ""MNC"". The phone has it defaulted on 330, and with T-mobile, it needs to be mortified to 260. Every time I change it, the whole thing won't save. It simply disappears. Later, I read another article saying that I can manually mortify the file that comes with the phone with all the APN information. After it's been changed accordingly to my carrier, it should be able to work. However, I cannot get access with the file without having the phone rooted. I could only read the file which did shown that T-mobile was not one of the carriers that the phone covers. So I gave up, I wasn't going to root the phone just so I can get access to my mobile data. So I factory reset the phone and planned to have it sent back. After I did that, the phone turned back on and was showing dialer screen immediately ask me to activate it. As it turned out, there's a number it automatically dials when you choose to have it activated. You won't even know what number it's calling. But you'll probably get a message saying ""your account is not authorized to make calls to this phone number"". So there, that's why when I first received the phone, it went to the home screen right away. Someone had to go in there to activate the phone with their own sim card I supposed, and it might just work for your carrier and it might not, like my situation. It's a shame I had to return it. It is still a great phone and I liked it very much. I would definitely keep it if it didn't cause me such trouble."
"Motorola, support is awful, this phone crapped out in less than 6 months, and they tried to pretend it was not covered under warranty, even though it CLEARLY states it comes with a 1 yer warranty, IF you can get Motorola to honor it. Took 4 customer service calls, each at least an hour long, to get them to honor the warranty! Will NEVER do business with Motorola again. STAY AWAY FROM MOTOROLA!!"
"aunt loves her phone, but does not know how to use it...it's an old person thing lol"
"I was initially scared of buying a cell phone online, but phone came just as described without any problems. Shipping was fairly fast. I have had no issues with the phone of any kind since the purchase and use it all day everyday."
Very impressed with this phone. Actually has 2 gig of ram. Received product very quickly and will do business with them again. Phone was just like the advertisement said. Brand new unit.
"I am Very Pleased with the phone. It has fulfilled all my expectations so far after one month of use. The only reason I am giving this product a 4-star rating is that the charger unit is working erratically! On two different occasions the unit was not charged at all. This makes me nervous, especially now that I will be travelling and need a reliable battery life. Also removing the screen protector resolved the problem of scratchy and garbled microphone sound."
Battery died in about 6 months.
"I'm thrilled with this phone! So easy to use, and so many features!"
"I was looking for a good US made phone and Motorola was the only one I could find. It works okay, but isn't that whizzing."
Good cell
"I've havent had any lag and the internal memory is adequate. So, I'm enjoying my Moto X very much!"
perfect
"The description says it's unlocked, but it's not. It worked for a while then an update from AT&T locked it again and now I cannot use it"
i still have this phone purchased it on 2014
Great product !!!!
"It's very good,so far. Not had it for long. But am impressed with my experience with it."
"I've owned this phone for about 2 years now. It's the first generation Moto (XT-1058).This is a good phone for everyday personal as well as business uses.I've had 2 Android updates in the time I've owned it. Kitkat and currently Lollipop.For some reason it took a longer time for Motorola to release the Lollipop update on this phone.I should mention that my WiFi started to act up right after the warranty ended.But I called Motorola, and they agreed it was so close that they'd honor their warranty anyway.I ended up not having to send it in because of good timing and the update corrected any WiFi issues.Everything else has worked reliably and ranks up there as a good alternative to an Iphone.The cons... I really wish this phone wasn't ""sealed"". Meaning opening it may void the warranty.It should've been made with an easier access to the battery and the ability to add an SD card.Otherwise, the 16 GB internal memory has about 10 GB available beyond what Android uses.That's adequate enough for a generous amount of photos, songs and maybe a few short videos.I don't play games on it. But it does run smoothly with a ""live"" screen and multiple apps opened.Overall, I would recommend this phone for the customer support by Motorola as well as the price."
Not what was described
It arrived with a scratch in the left edge beside the chip place.
Works great
"Perfect replacement for my previous Moto X, have not had one problem since my purchase a few months back."
I have odered MOTO x a month a ago and i got the product on time.Mobile and charger is present but missing ear phones.I suggest to go with the amazon
"Its look like new when I got it , however, I met big problem with battery . slow charge , and its goes down when its 45 % to 0% in 15 min when you just using Facebook apps. Not all the time .but its could be in any moment. That was 2 times in one day and I just returned. But phone look very good.moto x my favorite phone.I got new in moto website"
"I love my Moto G, mine was bought off the Amazon Warehouse but it arrived in mint condition, save for the box which was pretty beaten as stated. The phone, despite being a 2013 model still holds up pretty well to most current devices, Motorola was pretty clever designing this model, while processor specs are way below what other flagships offer, the architecture makes it seem like you have high end phone, 0 lag or stuttering whatsoever.My favorite part is that you get pure stock vanilla Android, BUT BEWARE the AT&T contains a little bloatware and as of 05/2015 cannot be safely rooted.The camera is the only letdown here, pretty mediocre (considering the specs), but the again I already knew that and didn't buy it for its camera, it covers my needs well enough.It's 2015 and this is a great price/quality alternative for everyone looking to get a quality device for at a budget pricepoint."
"fast delivery , and fullfiled expectations"
good phone... except the cam
Awesome phone! Best phone I ever own.
"Works great, fast, and it's more compact than most Androids these days..."
"Very powerfull phone. I bought two, and INE came with the USB cable broken. But both devices worked perfect!"
NUEVECITO
Not straight talk compatible.
"I was crazy about this phone before I was able to buy it and it really is amazing, the touchless controls are really easy to use and it's one of the features I use the most of the phone. The phone itself works really good, I haven't seen lag while using it, it's pretty fast to browse and I'm pretty satisfied with the purchase on a ""specs"" matter.I highly recommend this phone to everyone, Active display, Touchless controls and the Camera shake to start are unique features on the market right now (which don't drain the battery at all).100% happy with this purchase (a month use, I honestly would miss a lot of things if I change my phone in 2014, which I don't think I will considering the phone I have)"
"Responds really fast, battery lasts almost two days, voice controls are great, I dropped it on the floor a few times (including concrete, hardwood, etc...) and not a single scratch (while my Samsung phone broke after a 3 feet fall on carpet). I can make calls in places where my Samsung phone had no connection at all"
"I have ordered full white phone, but I recieve phone with black back cover. But it looks good too, even this is not what i want :)"
The Motorola X Phone is a fantastic phone. The almost stock Android on it runs absolutely smooth and the handset feels solid build (better than any Samsung and comparable to the iPhone). It also rests perfectly in the hand and I really like having a phone with a perfect size.I can really recommend it!
"This has to be 1 of the worst cells I have ever purchased, way to many dumb things to even mention. Don't waste your money trust me."
I'm not a cell phone expert but have read enough reviews to know this is the cool phone to buy right now. Everything works perfectly and it feels great in your hand. If you want a more technical review please look elsewhere. I do highly recommend this phone. Thanks.
"This phone is brilliant, not sure why they haven't launched it in Europe - I think it would do incredibly well!"
"I didn't give the 5 stars because when i opend it, the screen has a little mark on the top, like someone had use it before. But it wors perfectly!"
"The benefit/cost ratio is very good.It is a nice android smartphone, good performance and, to my needs, much better than Iphones."
I really really love it. I'm from Philippines and use it with my local SIM card. I wish I could get 32G but 16G is only available in Amazon. In moto website the unlocked developer version is the better choice for me since it is 32G but they don't accept foreign credit cards. This is not available in my country yet or never will be.I love the touchless control. No other android device can do that. I know you can download third party apps for same function but it drains the battery like hell. With moto x separate chip for touchless control battery is not an issue. I love the active display. I need not to unlock the phone to check incoming messages or other notifications. It shows on the screen when I pull out the phone in my pocket or just get it from the table….I was deciding between Nexus 5 and Moto X. Thoug N5 is beast on paper but the functionality of Moto X really works for me. I use it all the time when I'm driving my car.... best phone in history….
Grat!
It was a great experience
"I bought it directly from Amazon. It was brand new sealed in box, not any AT&T logo or so, with its original accessories (Motorola branded). Mine was made in the US (they are no longer manufactured in USA). I bought the 1st G unlocked, at $300. I consider it’s not fair to compare it with other phones that cost at least twice. In my opinion it is an excellent phone for its price range.I use it on my local network in Spain and it works fine.I’ve been using it for 3 months now and I haven’t had any problem with performance yet. What I like the most is how nippy it is. As well it’s very intuitive and easy to handle. The screen looks vibrant and sharp and the size of the phone is perfect.Battery life is ok; it gets me through a full day's use with ease. I hope it continues working this way over time!After reading all the Motorola advertising about the magnificent Moto X’s camera, I was expecting something amazing, but I don’t find it impressive; it is just ok. Pretty fast, it’s true, but standard quality.About the voice commands, a lot of people find them very useful, but honestly I have only tried the basic ones, I haven’t taken the time to learn how to use them so I cannot give any review about it. The screen flashes you the time and notifications when you put it out of your pocket or you just move it… without having to press any button. Great when you want to see what time it is while “sleeping”. Some people complains about it lacking a led for notifications or messages, but I find that led annoying, so don’t miss it.I guess the most important drawback is the storage capacity (absence of the SD slot). They give you 50GB of google drive cloud storage for free for two years but... then what? I’ve been reluctant to download any files there. Until now, I survive with the 16GB storage capacity.All in all, very solid phone, stylish, user-friendly at an affordable price. Not a perfect one but... if it were, it wouldn't cost what it does!For this butget, highly recommended."
Received the phone in good conditions as it stated on their site. I have not problems with the phone it has been running great.
"Have to give 2 stars. This was a nice phone at first, but after about 3 months, I was using the phone and it just made a loud POP! I noticed shortly after that there was a single clean break down the center face of the screen. I chatted with Motorola and they said they had repairs starting at $100, no warranty coverage."
Excellent product
"I did not feel well, the charger does not arrive, and the team is more deteriorated than described."
"5 stars device, fast and effective, write with finger is a must"
The phone has a camera bug.
it's good this smartphone
"Some difficulties using it overseas on foreign networks but overall it has been a great phone. Due to language barriers, the errors the phone gives me can't seem to be fixed by the mobile phone companies in town. The camera works OK, it was my main reason for purchasing the phone with data & cell service. I think my old HTC takes better pictures with a lower pixel count. It's difficult to adjust the camera settings and it seems to want to ignore screen saving settings. Sometimes it will dim in 15 seconds and other times it will stay on all night. I have done searches and can't seem to find a way to fix this setting or where the conflicting times/programming is located to have it dim & lock quickly to save battery life. It needs to be darkened or it will only last 1/2 day on a full charge. It was much less expensive than other unlocked phones. I find the quirks almost par for the course - I am overseas, with a phone I purchased in the States, on a network and country that has very limited English - I could have waited until I arrived in-country and purchased an unlocked Samsung or Iphone. However, I didn't know what the pricing and options would be prior to my arrival. It's served to be what I needed and seems to be reliable and predictable."
"Great phone, I would say that this is the best phone I have ever owned, I've owned S3, S4, Iphone3g-5s. And no questions asked this is the best, the only con I found on this phone is the camera. I accidentally dropped it on water and nothing happened to the phone."
Did not include the headphones
"Moto x works better than the Galaxy S4 Active. To much blot in the Active. Things didn't work at times, and it would get hot while using it and in my pocket. The Moto X is reliable and easy to use. The battery stays charged longer and it run just as fast."
Active Display is very good
I love it
Great phone. Takes good photos. Delivered on time. Very happy.
Fantastic phone ;)
I got this phone for my mom like two weeks ago. The package is well packed. The phone is working good and i don't find any lag. The phone feels like an extension of the arm. The phone fits well in your palm.
Phone arrived on time and works great. No issues except for the new box was cut off and the guy forgot to mention anything about it. The numbers removed were not needed in the end.
Great phone!
"the phone is beautiful. Is new and in perfect condition, fully unlocked, works great. I feel happy and satisfied"
"Phone would not make or recieve phone calls. Kept shutting off, I had to return it."
I was expecting it to be brand new (and it might be) but the box didn't seem to have original side items. The manual logged photocopied. Although unlocked and works great. The phone has at & t logo atb the back which I wasn't expecting.
"I ordered what was supposed to be the ""Factory Unlocked"" version but I got an AT&T branded phone, which had AT&T apps installed. The box was opened before and sealed again. the sim remover was missing.To my shock I found out that the mic is not working, if I called someone, I could hear them, but they could not hear me.Going to return this crap."
Excellent Phone.
"Got it used for $152 they said it was in good condition but it came like new 9.5/10 coming from a moto g which is a great phone i definitely notice a big diference on the screen quality fron lcd to amoled, the biggest upgrade coming from the moto g is the camera of the moto x, it takes great pictures, they're not amazing but it gets the job done pretty decently, battery life is also better and overall the phone feels more premium and it is a smoother experience on the OS for $152 i would say this phone is a steal."
"Excellent phone has been performing so far, all the expectations I had even think I've only glimpsed a very small percentage of all the possibilities and benefits of its use. My first knowledge of a Motorola Android was a Moto E, excellence led me to try a cell phone upgrade, and spent three months at a Moto G and 4 months he ascended more arriving to the current Moto X . Just have for now, 3 concerns: 1) Back in my country is powered 4G network and have not found this in the Moto X. Do not you have? 2) is too weak to capture the wifi in my house, while the Moto E and those with Samsung phones in my home, navigate easily, I have to be next to the router to get signal 3) What I think is more serious, the try to register the phone at Movistar (Venezuela) tells me I can not do because the IMEI (353,216,056,866,267) are already registered to another owner."
"Great phone, exceptional software. The back of the phone can be pushed in a little making a gnarling noise. This makes the whole look and feel not as solid as it could be. Not sure if this is the case with all units, but I find it a bit distracting."
This is probably the best phone I have ever had. I love the software from Moto it makes the moto X a great phone. The battery is not the best considering the 720P screen but all and all the form factor and the software makes for a great phone. I now own an iPhone 6 Plus and miss my moto!
The best phone right now.
excellent
It's an excellent phone. But it's AT&T branded.
My customer is very happy with the product
Nice smartphone
satisfact
"It has been the best Motorola I've ever bought. Motorola never lets down with the use of the battery and this one lasts quite nicely. With all the recent updates on software I did after getting the phone, everything works to its best."
100% recommended excellent product
"Nice smartphone.Stylish, user-friendly and cheap.Tiny disadvantage - it come with WHITE charger, while the phone itself is solid black.Definitely, for completely black phones only black (or dark) accessories should be used. :)But this is only my humble opinion."
"A smart phone, really good!"
"Best smartphone ever, too bad that Google sold Motorola =/"
le dejo 4 estrellas porque no tiene accesorios completos
its perfect
"this phone sucks, has many defects. The screenshot does not work. The camera is horrible, every image has a whitish glow in it. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAPPY PHONE."
"Everything is great with this phone, and for the price, you can't get anything better."
Confirm model number before ordering. This is not unlocked version but xt1058 that is locked to AT&T.
"Better instruction will always be helpful, but overall, it is one exceptional system. It's the last unit produced before Motorola was sold, and it was their best.I would recommend it to everyone. Check it out for yourself and you will quickly see what I mean."
you say that this phone is new but a lie is used and one side has a crack you are scammer
My moto x next came damn near perfect I didn't notice a single flaw and it worked great I love it
Perfect!!
"Pros: You can throw this phone across the room and it won't scratch. It's solid. Unlocked = no extra fluff. Call quality/reception seems to be fine. Size is perfect; not huge like most new phones. Battery life is excellent.Cons: Camera is mediocre. Comes with some AT&T apps (unobtrusive, but they're there.) Difficult to find the right size accessories for; you have to get them off of Amazon (which, if you're reading this review, is not likely a problem for you.) I use it on T-Mobile and had to go to the T-Mobile store to pick up a nano SIM card for it. There's no SD card, but I backup my photos on Google and don't store much media, so not an issue for me."
love it
Great phone exactly what i expected. I bought used and it's almost brand new can't even tell its been used
Is very nice an useful
very nice
The phone is for my wife as a replacement for her crunched Moto-X. She loves the phone!
This phone is pretty much what I was expecting from reviews. The smaller size is great as well! Especially for my baby hands.
We have an exchange student who needed a phone. This has been a perfect phone for her. She has taught us things we didn't know about some phones apps that we can use:).
excellent product. good quality.
"I received the phone but the microphone did not work. Upon sending it back, a replacement was sent. The new one works fine. This is a really nice phone."
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It was refurbished but looked brand new. She loved it!
"I enjoyed this product it was a little slow after the first week or two and only declined from there. But, the moto x voice features this phone is capable of changed my veiws on what a phone should be able to do."
"When I received the speaker didn't work, the description didn't mention that was a defective item."
"Dang it, battery wasn't good from the get go but hen it got worse after the lollipop software whatever. If I wanted bad battery life at that time I would have gotten an iPhone."
"Came with defective charger that wouldn't charge. Had to get a different one. Speaker option is terrible and useless as it echoes the other person making conversation almost impossible. I hate not being able to use the speaker, as I am used to with my old phone. It's frustrating to not be able to put it down and talk while doing something else with my hands. Being a mom, this is an annoying inconvenience. Also, the headset broke within days. People complain that they cannot hear me when I talk. I have to scream into the phone. Gets extremely hot at times. Did NOT come with tool to remove and install SIM card. Battery dies really fast. Got to charge several times a day."
Good product.
highly recommended!
"Great features, some problems with the person having a conversation with hearing me. Seems to be working fine now......follow up review..... microphone did not work correctly. Contacted Motorola found out this phone was manufactured for Chile and they would not air honor their warranty. Fortunately Amazon accepted the return to them."
Very nice phone and looked new instead of used !
Worst phone ever!!!
"Just received the Moto X…. pretty disappointed, I’ve paid for a new one, it looks as an open box item!. It’s dirty, no seals ……Be aware ....."
"I am living in China while moto X is not sold in my country, so I had to buy it from Amazon. It was about 2 weeks late when I received my phone. It is worthy to wait for that long time because of moto X's perfect using experience.Now I have use my moto X for almost a month and I like it. Thank you Moto & Amazon so much."
"This phone does it all. Great reception, audio and fast web browsing on LTE. Above all, the phone feels great in my hand and the display is beautiful. Once I drained the battery a few times, the battery lasted a whole day with lots of web surfing and playing video. I like being able to talk to the phone and have it do what I ask. There may be better specs on a few other so called high end smart phones, but when you combine all the great features of this phone, I doubt there is a better overall phone.I fell so in love with this phone, that I bought a second one. In terms of appearance, I like the white one over the black one, as I own both colors."
"I come from the iPhone... I love the iPhone or should I say... I loved the iPhone.My iPhone 5 broke on me a while back and like a guy that wants to know if the neighbors wife better than his own, I decided that I wanted to try an android phone.Since I come from an top tier Phone I went and bought the top tier... HTC one. That was a greatish experience and I kind of enjoyed it... but then I lost it somewhere (probably in a cab).Since my first Android experience with the HTC was somewhat good and I was sick of breaking or loosing 600$+ phones, I decided I would buy a middle of the road, not to pricey, ok phone.Then the Moto X came in the mail: Holy Crap! Snappy as hell, every thing I used to run on my high end phones runs just as smooth on this one. But that is not what makes this phone stand out.Stock Android + a few tweaks like the active display and touchless control sets this phone apart... More than that, it sets new standards, something that very very few phone have done in years.I could not go back to a phone that would have me press a button to display the time. Sound trivial.. maybe it is, but I'm lazy and you are to... you just don't know it yet.Touchless control is great... I love seeing the jealous eyes of iPhone owners when I say ""ok google now"" without touching it and the screen pops up.Other android phone makers should take notes here: Why invest money in designing a stupid custom baked layer of creamy OS crap on top of the already excellent Android (looking at you HTC and Samsung) . Vanilla Android is oh! so much better, lighter, cleaner, sleeker, snappier and simpler.You should not care about this phone specs:Get this phone!It is the proof that 700$ phones are overpriced and overrated."
great phone love everything about it. super fast perfect size for me. well worth price. battery life is just great last forever
"It's just great. Works perfectly in my 4G network outside the States. Great Quality, better than other more expensive phones."
"The functionality, and features of this phone are generally working as expected. Have had no issues with it so far, system performance has been fine.Have not yet really tested out it's ability to the maximum yet, but has been good so far."
"Great Phone!! Great Price!! Great Features! Camera not so great, but fulfills basic needs. I highly recommend this phone, you get much more than the price you pay."
Upgraded from a Nokia C3 to this smartphone. Lots to learn! Love the size of the screen and its clarity!
"I asked for a black cellphone and it only came with a white charger. I thought it came with earphones, also. The box wasn't sealed. Works fine, though."
"It's just perfect, love the phone it works great, the only minimun problem that i had was the nano sim, in my country (Venezuela) they don't produce it, i have it with Movilnet and it works with no problem. The only bad thing, for me, about the phone it's that doesn't have a notification led, the notifications are on screen."
"Bought this phone for my wife as a gift for Christmas. It was advertised as an unlocked phone. However, the phone is in fact an At&t phone. In other words, you can't get rid of any of the At&t garbage thats on the phone. It even has At&t stamped on the back. This is not being honest & forthright as to what the item actually is."
"I bought two of these about a month ago and I'm very impressed with this little phone. For users of Google services (gmail et al) the integration is quick and seamless. It's faster than I expected and provides all the functionality I need. The battery life is pretty good. For me it requires charging only every other day most of the time, although if used heavily it needs to be charged every day. I also like that it is factory unlocked (so can be used in most foreign countries easily) but came with a US warranty."
It did not come with a sim card!!!!
cult
"Amazing phone. But gets slow over the time, don't know why."
Got this as a gift to my dad. Works very well with T-Mobile. also this handset came with a T-Mobile nano sim.
Phone is excellent.
very nice phone
Got this for my daughter for Christmas. She's going to love it.
"This phone did a great job for a little under a year and then started having some problems. Up until then, this phone handled everything great and still managed it in a small form factor.It's about the same size as the original Moto G, but has a slightly large screen with less bezel. Having just upgraded from a Moto G, I really enjoyed the size change. It also took pretty decent photos (nothing earth shattering) and handled everyday navigating, Reddit browsing, texting, and calls with ease. Was a pretty trouble free phone for a good while, but I wish that would last longer.It started having an issue where it would lock up and then would need to be restarted. Once it was restarted, it would take almost 10 minutes to boot up. Apparently this was a known issue that a bunch of people were having problems with.If you were lucky and didn't get this issue, the phone was great. Especially on very close to stock android, instead of being loaded with bloatware."
"This is by far the best phone I've owned to date. I've used my moto x for about a year, but I had to step up to a different phone that company provided me with. This phone is a huge successor and if you are still on the budget I would still get it.-Everything worked on that phone. I never received any errors from any apps.-It's very snappy and even after few months of using it, it never slowed down.-It has great AMOLED screen. Some say it's over saturated, but after using it for while it's just so colorful that some LED screens look very dull in comparison.-Very comfortable in hand. Very hard to drop it from hand because of non slip baking.-Great in call quality, good microphones, crisp and loud speakerphone.-Touch less controls-No boot ware-Cheap.-decent battery lifeOnly con I could think of is camera, which is not bad, but could have been a little better."
"Bad product, it worked for less than 5 months, even though I never let it fall, and always took care of the phone. The store didn't have any communication with me and stopped answering me when I argued that the phone had something wrong. I am really disappointed, I wouldn't buy any product from there anymore, after wasting my money with a product that no longer work and being ignored when asking for review."
Good phone.
"Nice phone , a lot of phone for the money . Works great on Cricket . Just order yourself a Cricket starter kit her on Amazon for $10, plug in the sim and you are good to go . Be sure and get the Cricket app from the app store ."
very good
"EXCELLENT, just came to worship. :D It works very well in Lara - Venezuela, is fast, has plenty of capacity supports many applications and several games, the images are incredible , very good sound, use the smallest chip. the only thing wrong is that it does not bring headphones and packaging came uncovered. :/"
"Loved this phone, but sadly Motorola has gone to crap, never gave me an android update so I got a new phone."
Phone seems fine
"Motorola, support is awful, this phone crapped out in less than 6 months, and they tried to pretend it was not covered under warranty, even though it CLEARLY states it comes with a 1 yer warranty, IF you can get Motorola to honor it. Took 4 customer service calls, each at least an hour long, to get them to honor the warranty! Will NEVER do business with Motorola again. STAY AWAY FROM MOTOROLA!!"
"Received the Phone today (2/23/2015) and the box had clearly been opened and then resealed. I was expecting this to be a New, factory sealed phone. If this is not the case, it should have been clearly stated in the items description. will update stars based on response from TronicSpot"
"Great! I love it. The Moto X is the best phone I have ever hard. The battery life is excellent, the camera is great, both front and back.I simply just love this phone, will recomand for everyone to try Moto X...excellent cell phone"
Oh Yeah! Great phone at a reasonable Price.
Love this phone its lightening fast when using the internet
Item condition was not as expected. It has some cosmetic damages on the SIM tray.
Best Phone Ever!! :D
excellent product. recommend purchasing this item
"If you're not of the type that bigger is better, you'll love it."
"excellent care, responsibility and seriousness in business."
the best election i chage mi motorola moto g for this
"Although it says that its an unlocked version The phone carries At&t logo. If not for that, the phone was great. Really enjoying the device"
"Great phone, very fast and beutiful, I love that it knows when I pull ir out of my pocket"
"Phone is super cool, i loved touch less control, but worst part is that it is AT&T locked and logo at back side. I returned it."
"Excellent phone, upgraded to android 4.4 as soon as I started to using it. The system feels smooth and the screen is great, despite not being full HD."
Perfect. Thanks.
I love the phone but the reason that I don't give the five stars is because the seller never says that the phone has the at&t logo.
"Ok google now voice commands are super cool. I love being able to set an alarm by just talking to my phone. I wish more phones had this technology. However, this technology is really pointless if I can barely make it through the day with the battery life. There are people that claim more than a day.....they must have a different phone. I've had the phone for a few weeks now and I'm just waiting to figure out if there is a way to improve battery. You can't even buy another battery and swap it out. I shut off the location to make it more of a ""dumb phone"" but that didn't even seem to help much. I think I will be returning it. It seems that I always have to charge it during the day no matter how much I use it. I think it is kind of crazy. Maybe this preloaded att software is the problem?Also, I love to use headphones, but this headphone jack is super sensitive. My old cheap samsung galaxy Ace didn't have voice commands but at least i could use headphones and know that the connection wouldn't break if my phone moved in my pocket.Motorola support was bad. They affirmed that my battery was underperforming as they looked at my imei but then after giving me a few pointless tips that didn't work it seems they gave up on me (it's been a week). Maybe this one is just a melon? I read another user that said that it feels like the percentage drops 1 per minute of screen time. (at times it feels like that) I try to not use the phone for anything so that I will have power for phone calls but then what is the point of the cool features? (and that doesn't seem to help much anyway).Maybe Motorola only helps if you buy it from them? I got this from a seller and it was an ATT phone, but I think it's unlocked (I'm using it with gophone)"
"Couldn't find a way to even update the OS from android 4.4. Contained AT&T bloatware and logos. Returned. Amadon should be a bit more careful about what's being sold here. Waste of a lot of time and some money for shipping material for return!!! Advertise as AT&T Unlocked phone if it really needs to be sold here[Update 07/29/14] Got a replacement phone, BINGO, thats another AT&T Moto X. Contacted customercare to find out what to do with this one."
Very good cell phone. Camera is impressive. The only thing that could get better is the batery. Sometumes doesn't last even for a day.
"Excelent...! It works in movilnet, Digitel y movistar...model xt1053"
Great a+++++
This phone is not Unlocked as promised!!!! It has AT&T logo in the back and in stickers!!! I need an unlocked phone!
"This phone is AWESOME!!!! I have no queries in regards to the condition it came in. It said new, it came new. But back to this phone. I live in the Caribbean and this phone works well, so it's truly unlocked. if you're thinking about this phone, think no more, buy it, then come back and thank me!"
Excellent phone with good battery life and plenty of power for my requirements.I dont know how to get rid of AT&T phone book though. I am using the phone on TMobile.
"Yes, I HATE this cell phone, why? because this is not an unbranded cellphone (what I supposed I bought) this has AT&T logo on its back and a lot of stuff from that company, I'm from outside the United States so it is not easy for me return this item, I wouldn't recommend this seller (US WIRELESS) because he is selling a product that is not new and is not accurate with description, I feel dissapointed and even cheated.Somebody can give me some help with this? this is the first time that I have a problem with a purchase."
"very nice phone,but the one i got must have been faulty.battery drained suddenly two different times. reception was bad also.thank you amazon and mango wireless for the no hassle return and great customer service."
"Good not great. The camera is definitely the weak link with the phone. I love the twist of the wrist to activate the camera but the camera itself doesn't take great pictures unless you have ideal lighting. I haven't taken advantage of the Google Now features. I am sure they are nice but I haven't found a need for them(like I thought I might). I like the size of the phone a lot. Other phones in my price range were bigger and I didn't like that. For my price point this phone is great, but if money were no object I would probably opt for a spendy iphone just because of the camera. I don't require my phone to change the world with all its super powers but I do want to capture some good photos."
I returned the phone because it was locked on AT&T network and I was not able to change it to Consumer Cellular. Otherwise it was a great phone.
"GOOD PRODUCT, GOOD SELLLER!!"
"Since it's my first 'smart phone', I'm finding it somewhat challenging to figure out on my own!"
"This is Motorola Moto X XT1058 for AT&T(it also has a ATT logo on the back case). See below that it does not have 1700 and thus will have issues working with T-Mobile 3g in all areas not refarmed(modernized to use 1900).3G Network HSDPA 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100 - for AT&T3G Network HSDPA 850 / 900 / 1700 / 1900 / 2100 - for T-MobileI am using T-Mobile and issue with me was that it used to catch 2g and 4g , but unable to catch 3g. Now people use 80% time 3g and was useless to me(I was troubled for more than a month. I am returning the phone(a goodwill from amazon) and have asked amazon to blacklist the seller as he does not give correct information.Hope this helps someone and does not face problems that I have faced."
"Its an excellent product and i like it a lot. Maybe you cand work on include the headset because i was wating for that when i received the product but now, when i checked the box; it says that doesn't includes that accesorie. Its just and advice to improve the offer. Thanks."
"Greate phone, really loved it."
"Nice phone for the money, no complaint.I can say better than S4, in terms of battery life and performance."
It's great
super...
"This phone is great. Battery life is good. No complaints. After researching this phone vs the iphone, I picked this one, and I am glad I did. Bought an unlocked one and was able to easily hook it up with Consumer Cellular. Very happy."
"I absolutely love this phone. I moved to this from a Samsung Captivate and it's like I'm just experiencing my smartphone for the first time. Speed is great for my needs--I don't watch movies on my phone. The battery life is remarkable. Screen resolution is fine for my 68-year-old eyes. The cameras (both of them) are fine. As a matter of fact, one of the main things I was looking for in a new phone was high-res photos. The Moto X delivers for photos I want to post online. Love the way the camera responds by shaking without having to unlock the device. That's a really neat feature compared to the tedious way my previous phone's camera worked. Size and weight are great and I like the feel of the slightly curved back. I use a beautiful blue Cimo flexible case with the phone which adds some protection and a rough surface on the sides. I didn't carry my previous phone with me regularly, as many folks tend to do now. With the Moto X I'm finding it's so much easier to use that I do carry it all the time. My previous phone also was kind of slow and creaky with notification. With this phone I can see immediately where my communications are coming from, whether, e-mail, Facebook, Whatapp, Skype, or whatever, and can easily respond as needed. I have used voice controls (Go Google Now, etc.) a couple times but need to explore that a bit more before I can really say I enjoy using it. All-in-all a definite winner in the smartphone derby."
My wife is happy:)Happy wife happy life:)
"Some difficulties using it overseas on foreign networks but overall it has been a great phone. Due to language barriers, the errors the phone gives me can't seem to be fixed by the mobile phone companies in town. The camera works OK, it was my main reason for purchasing the phone with data & cell service. I think my old HTC takes better pictures with a lower pixel count. It's difficult to adjust the camera settings and it seems to want to ignore screen saving settings. Sometimes it will dim in 15 seconds and other times it will stay on all night. I have done searches and can't seem to find a way to fix this setting or where the conflicting times/programming is located to have it dim & lock quickly to save battery life. It needs to be darkened or it will only last 1/2 day on a full charge. It was much less expensive than other unlocked phones. I find the quirks almost par for the course - I am overseas, with a phone I purchased in the States, on a network and country that has very limited English - I could have waited until I arrived in-country and purchased an unlocked Samsung or Iphone. However, I didn't know what the pricing and options would be prior to my arrival. It's served to be what I needed and seems to be reliable and predictable."
The best phone to have if your budget is low. A very smart phone for its price. Best design in market. Cool touch. Awesome pic resolution. Best is when the light is less. No other phone has a better camera now. No complaints.
Very good
Good cell phone
This is a very good mobile phone
Excelente
"The phone is having issue with its screen sensitivity. Even without my touch, it starts displaying various options. Really bad experience"
Great phone...no point in writing a review for the phone itself. If you want that check out The Verge or Engadget. When purchased from Mango Wireless (fulfilled by Amazon) item was new as described and in perfect working condition.
excelente
Amazing phone. Period.
"really great features for the price, totally worth it!"
Good
I dropped this phone and it completely smashed.
"I bought this phone to replace an Motorola Matrix 4G. The screen is bright and has great color. The phone works like a dream. The only thing I've noticed is it doesn't have a led for notifications and messages. It makes up for this by showing the notices on the screen when you move it. With the led you could see if there was a message by looking at the phone without touching it. There is no way to delete multiple messages like I could on my Atrix, and no way to add a signature to text messages. I realize that these issues are the fault of the operating system and not the phone. Battery life is the same as my Atrix about a full day of normal use. Getting the phone activated on AT&T was simple. I thought all I would have to do was put my Sim in the new phone. My old Sim was way to big. Went to the local AT&T store and a new Sim was put in and the tech offered to transfer info for me. I didn't have him do that, but he was very helpful. The whole process took about 10 minutes. Still learning about all the new features and abilities of the much newer phone. I think it is a great phone and would recommend it to anyone."
"The phone is great, I ordered one at Morotola.com. But make sure your phone company works perfectly with this model. I have T-Mobile and the 4G was not working."
"This is the phone I wanted, came quickly as advertised. The phone was an AT&T model but had already been unlocked. Once I put my T-Mobile SIM card in it was running right away. Minor cosmetic scuffs on the corners, but there are no problems with the phone."
Great
The phone did not start. So I had to return it
Excellent
"This phone was bought five months ago and now it's all but trash. WiFi and Bluetooth stopped functioning and battery lasts less than 3 hours. Motorola replied to my complain with a ""better luck next time"" and this seller isn't even worth looking at. Scammers."
"Great phone, wish I hadn't broken the first one I got!"
"This is the best phone I have ever owned. It's fast, smart and fits in my hand and pocket well. Do not be fooled by specs. This phone does everything quickly. The screen is very good and it hooked right up to consumer cellular and updated right away. It has a lot of features other phones do not have."
great phone and great phone call quality
it's great .
ok
No issues except battery life. Need to charge it every night.
It's very good and working well in China.
excellent
Great cell Phone!
"Great phone, not too big or too small and operates smoothly."
They did return my money after a lot of emails. Communication wasn't that great.
"Got a branded phone, even though it wasnt mentioned that it will be ATT branded. Phone is great, works nice so far."
"This seller is a total scammer. Sell ​​Used Moto X smartphones without any original accessory, the box is not authenticated, the charger is old, the data cable is not the authentic nor headphones. Sell ​​Moto X with dents in the casing, scratches and dirty. What a disappointment. Please amazon.com should take action on the case, as this risks his reputation to have providers of this type, as irresponsible and shameless, rob individuals selling used with announcement of new products. Scammers do not buy this preducto this store. They should be prosecuted."
"Most useful features available on a smartphone as of today. I never thought that I was able to have a big screen on a small phone. Sounds contradictory, but you will see what I mean once you hold it."
This smartphone is not new. The accesories is not original of Motorola. This is responsability of seller.The slot for chip is lacerated.
"Love the look, feel in the hand, awesome interface and the cool features, shaking it to quickly open the camera, the no-hands google now."
"Very smooth, easy to use. I bought it for $299. It is a good deal, I think. If you have enough money, don't hesitate!"
it's a nice and wonderful cellphone.yesterday updated Android 4.4.3.There is a small crack on the right side of the phone . customer service quickly solved the problem.
"One of the best, latest software and latest technology phone which comes in budget price. This 4.4.2 Android phone which is very much faster, nice touch screen and more over this phone is different from other phone for Moto Assist app. Moto X responds to your voice, without you having to touch it this is very nice. Battery backup is ~18 hrs with Facebook, Skype and some other application like live news update etc. I have been using for 2 weeks I have never see any hang crash or any kind of issue. Camera photo quality is need improvement. Over all best Android phone with compare to price."
very good phone. the only thing i can complain is the camera. lack of consistency. others functions good. solid phone.
"It's fast. Great looking display, sharp images. Not 1080 HD but 720, good enough for me. On Kitkat. Active display on standby is great. It notifies you whenever you have messages, emails or anything you want to be notified of (settings). Battery does not last that long - for me about 2 days on light/moderate usage. Heavy users will probably need to charge it every nite. The 'Ok Google Now' feature is marvellous. You don't even have to touch the phone to wake it up. You just have to say: ""OK Google Now"" and give it a command. You can check messages, set an alarm, get directions, find out the weather, or do just about anything.It's a great bargain for the price of less than $400. Highly recommended."
Very good quality of phone. Cool features from Moto and Google
VERY GOOD PRODUCT.
The phone works great and the service provided went as expected. I recommend it.
Brand new in the box and worked perfectly. Unlocked phones are the way to go...
"Great phone, labeled as unlocked but was in fact an AT&T phone."
My first smartphone. It's nice.
5stars
"Its a very good cellphone, i like it..Good service"
"The phone does not look new to me. Chances are this is a refurbished item. Due to my crazy schedule I will just keep the phone and discontinue using Amazon. This isn't my first issue with Amazon. Besides that, the phone is amazing."
"MOTO X is OK, just arrived late."
"This is what an android phone is supposed to be like. There is very little bloat stuff that motorola adds, so you get a rather pure android experience."
"Great phone for me, easy to use and suitable for my needs"
"The phone is amazing. But I got an AT&T unlocked version, I thought that it was an International unlocked version. So it comes with the AT&T logo at the back, also comes with some nasty AT&T apps which are useless for me. So the phone is pretty cool but the seller is not totally honest with the cellphone description.The phone is 5 starts for me, the seller not that much. I'm not sure if the seller is reselling carrier cellphones on a legal way or this is a kind of illegal business, but I have a bad feeling about it. So be aware about that."
I loved it!
Excellent support and product. Thanks for everything. Regards
"great price with the discount, white is a nice finish, works perfectly and no bloatware"
Best phone I have ever had and I have had them all. Love it
Finally a phone that works
"It's a beautiful, useful, and elegant phone."
"Original 5 star review - Bought 2 and we are enjoying them. Big improvement over Atrix 2. Was a great deal when they were on sale by Amazon for less than $300. Not sure if I would buy one from 3rd party marketplace. The ones sold from Amazon are definitely brand new sealed in box.That was my original 5 star review. Two weeks ago I dropped my phone from a distance of about 12 inches from the pavement. It cracked the screen. You could argue that the phone is too fragile but I call it my bad. I contacted Motorola and agreed to $100 replacement and $25 expedite fee. Seemed fair to me. Unfortunately the phone they sent me has intermittent boot up problems. I discovered that after a factory reset on my old working phone (albeit with a cracked screen) and having spent hours setting up the new phone. That led to my 4 hours of calls to Motorola. First they wanted to charge me another $125 for the second replacement phone. But finally they came thru and are expediting a new replacement phone no charge. The cool thing though is that they are upgrading me to a new 2nd generation phone,"
Excellent
"Worked properly once registered, easy to use and phone looks good."
Excellent phone.
Came new and sealed in the box. Works wonderfully and without problem. What a great price!
Received with damaged charging port. Stopped charging after 3 weeks. No support from seller or Amazon. Out $219.00
very happy
Great phone. Absolutely no problem with the product. The product was delivered right on time and have been using it for last 2 months. Just love it.
Excellent

good product
"I'm in love with this cellphone! It's just perfect!The battery dies with almost 2 days when you don't use the phone too much. If you use internet, make some calls, etc, it will dies with one day.I think that's ok, because all the new cellphones in market has the same battery power as moto x."
"The fake carbon fiber backing is starting to separate. The battery hasn't even made a year before it will no longer hold a charge for 8 hours. Nice design and uncluttered interface, decent price.-1 Stars due to the venerable American brand, Motorola now being owned by the Chinese. Thank you Google and the US Government."
"The battery isn't very good, but it is nice."
"I ordered the ATT unlocked Moto X model XT1058 from MyParana. I am a T-Mobile customer in the Dallas-FortWorth metroplex. The ATT-branded Moto X phone came in its original Motorola box with a wall charger, micro USB cable, SIM card tool and instruction manual. Here is a breakdown of my experience using the phone:- T-mobile 4G LTE, 4G and EDGE networks works on the phone in the areas I frequent. Looking forward to T-Mobile's expansion of their 1900Mhz infrastructure to support 4G/3G where 4G LTE is unavailable.- Wi-Fi setup and service works without any issue- Motorola Migrate failed to pair my old Android 2.3.7 phone with the Moto X. I used Google cloud services to transfer my old phone's contact and data to the Moto X- FM radio hardware is not installed on the Moto X. I only get internet radio on this phone- Moto Assist, Touchless Controls(Voice Commands) , Camera, phone calls are working great!- Apps installed without an issue and looks great on the 4.7 AMOLED screenThis is a great phone for the price. Just do due diligence on your phone carrier's network bands before you purchase the XT1058 for a non-ATT network."
"This phone is so much better than the DiePhone it replaced. Looking forward to the Moto X1. No more I regrets for me. It may be time to BurrySiri. The voice recognition actually works! And the product is assembled in the USA. Great phone, excellent seller, can't beat the quality/price and not built in China!"
"Not what I wanted. Buyer beware! This is XT1058 AT&T version of moto x with locked bootloader, not XT1053 as some reviewers here suggested."
Ok all good but the gb its to smell!
"This is an awesome phone and one of the best values for your dollar if not the best. The screen pops, the speed is excellent, no lag at all. The Motorola specific features are industry leading and the battery life is above the average of the top shelf competitors. I would recommend this phone to a friend."
"so far so good, 3 weeks."
I think for the price it is a great for. The feel Is wonderful
great phone
The usb/charger is not good
The phone have been rebuild.
Love this phone. Easy platform. Works just like my Android tablet. Durable with long battery life. Definitely recommend
Perfect in every way!
"Clearly a Referb from this buyer. Came with small scratches, and aftermarket plug. Slow shipping from Singapore. I have had the phone about a month now, the battery will not last through the day."
works great overseas
I was very surprised to have received the phone BEFORE the estimated dates.
"Loving this phone! Easy to use, comfortable size, nice camera!"
I have odered MOTO x a month a ago and i got the product on time.Mobile and charger is present but missing ear phones.I suggest to go with the amazon
"I ordered this phone for use on the Metro PCS network in southern Florida. I was moving to this phone from an LG Optimus F6. I was frustrated with that phone because of it's lack of internal memory. I couldn't put many apps on my phone because the internal storage was limited to something around 1gig of usable space.This phone, by comparison, is a dream. The internal storage allows for all the apps I wanted to put on my phone and more. The lack of external storage might be a problem for some, but for me it's no big deal. I took it in to the local Authorized dealer and they installed a nano sim card and had me up and running on the 4gLTE data network. SMS, voicemail, streaming video and audio all work perfectly.The specs on this phone were not top of the line when it was released a year and a half ago, but thanks to the X8 system (where extra cores handle specific features) this phone is still silky smooth and blazing fast. There's no lag or stutter opening apps, even when quickly switching between multiple programs. The only delay is waiting for information from the internet to load.The phone initially got negative points in reviews that I read for the photo quality, but with the 4.4.4 kitkat update, the photo quality is now excellent.Battery life is great. It lasts me all day with moderate to heavy use. I do use DU Battery Saver Pro to achieve that length of battery.I won't go too much into a phone review itself, as there are tons of reviews out there, I'll just say that I'm extremely happy with this phone, it works perfectly on Metro PCS, it's good looking, good feeling in hand, and does everything I want it to do as fast as I want it to do it. Couldn't ask for more.As far as the seller I bought from, mine came from TronicSpot. It was sold as new, but the packaging (the actual retail box) was very banged up and dirty, looked like it had been used in a warehouse kickball game almost..When I opened the retail box the phone was covered in white residue from the particleboard like shell casing over the phone unit, it almost looked like the box had gotten wet and the particle material had transferred due to moisture, but I can't be sure. With the look of the box, I was skeptical about the phone, but when I powered it up my worries vanished. It works great, and does appear to be a new phone. I guess the box just took a beating in their storage location or something.My only quibble with the phone is that it comes unlocked in my pocket when I wear loose fitting shorts to work. I don't know if the fabric is catching the power button, or if somehow the active notification unlock screen is getting activated in my pocket, but I've placed several calls from the pocket and sent several texts. Slightly annoying but not a deal breaker since it apparently only happens in loose pockets. Tighter pocketed pants do not seem to share the problem."
People cannot hear me when I make a callI live in Brazil and Motorola does not give me warranty.I bough a new product and can't use it!!!!
"Bought the unlocked white version of this phone, which was originally AT&T (16 GB for about $260.) Using it on T Mobile, and it works great. Overall, this is a compact, solid phone. And I'm pretty happy with it so far (3 months of use.) The only thing I don't like about it is the AT&T address book that comes loaded in it: it is often slow to launch, somewhat dull AND (and this is the annoying part) on occasions it will prompt you to sign up for the 'AT&T Free Backup Service', which is of course for AT&T customers. Since I use this phone on T Mobile, this is useless for me, and I haven't found a way to disable this annoyance. Other AT&T bloatware is minimal and not an issue. The camera is good for snapshots under good light, but not great in dark settings (such as in low light bars.) But this is not an issue for me, since I'm a light user of media. I usually don't listen to music on my phone either, so can't comment on that. But as I said, I'm pretty happy with the phone and would recommend it to others. At this price, I think you get what you pay for it, and then some."
This phone was sold as good condition but I can say it is like new and even came with the box cables and instructions. I bought this because it was the same price as repairing my screen and I had got one for my wife as well previously so Iwould know if it was flawed. Also since I went from motox to motox it migrated perfectly.
The phone arrived on time. This is the best phone that I ever had.
Excellent !!
"I ordered what was supposed to be the ""Factory Unlocked"" version but I got an AT&T branded phone, which had AT&T apps installed. The box was opened before and sealed again. the sim remover was missing. Going to return this crap.Im upset because I ordered this to take to Argentina for my sister, and now I'm going empty handed."
"Received a ""new"" phone that has speakers that don't hardly work. I can barely be heard by anyone when I make a call, either on speaker or not."
"Excellent phone, works in Argentina."
Great phone!
Its very good
Excelente producto
This phone is Amazing! THAT IS ALL!!!
Phone is in perfect condition. I had to buy a sim card slot because I broke mine
phone is a nice one
I am really enjoying this phone. It is not super big like a lot of the newer phones but it has all of the great specs. Thanks to all of the other reviews which helped me to make my decision to purchase this phone!
Amazing phone in great condition.
Very good
"I like the moto X and I have been using the device for since 4 months. I got a problem with processing speed and Speaker sound, i later asked Motorola customer service about the warranty. I then found out that my warranty is out of date. This seller cheated me saying that it had a US warranty."
perfecto
"I gave 4 stars because the phone was advertised as new but had visible wear on the power button and the accessories were obviously repackaged. Even for a refurbished/used phone, I am very happy. The rest of the phone was clean and scratch free. It came unlocked as advertised and works well in South Asia cell phone service. The phone features are amazing and the speed is great. The touch-less response is a little slow to start with the phone in an otter-box case. The stock AT&T contact list is a little annoying but the rest of the AT&T software can be disabled. Still very much a flagship phone and I couldn't be happier."
This has been a great phone to use and came in new condition.
"Everything it should be, still a killer after two years."
MUY BUEN PRODUCTO
Did not work in Mexico. Said it was unlocked.
Great phone!!!
"This phone has been kicking for almost a year and 5 months, I've noticed no problems. The battery as with all smartphones doesn't hold a charge like day 1, but I get a full day of moderate to heavy use. I came to Moto X from a line of flagship phones, including the first Galaxy S, HTC One, and the LG G2. All of those phones were certainly premium at the time I owned them. I can honestly say this is my favorite phone I've owned (close tie to the G2 maybe). You can definitely tell this isn't a brand new flagship, yet it has run for a great while and feels awesome to use (definitely doesn't feel cheap). I plan on using it until it becomes a temptation to get a new phone. The size is such a big plus in the time of ever larger phones, it doesn't feel too huge or sloppy with an Otter Box Defender Series case one hand operation is a breeze. I also absolutely love the hands free activation of Google Now, I find myself using it quite a bit. For the price the display is excellent, the stripped down and bloat lite software is a charm. The camera is mediocre at best, but meh, that's why I have a camera. I have learned my lesson with phones as with all tech, always buy middle of the road unless you are very very serious about having the newest toy, for the price difference you receive very diminished returns at the top end, and at the low end you sacrifice quality and performance making your device obsolete sooner."
Phone has great features. Camera just doesn t match up with iphone. Went back to iphone.
It works well
perfect
best phone Ive ever had. That includes the bagphone.
"Good phone, i like it very much"
"Excellent team, provides good performance, the software runs fluid, battery performance is good even with heavy use. The size is very comfortable because it is not overly large."
Bought this for my wife and she loves the phone. We had Spr*nt service before and went to AT&T for the better calling plan and coverage. Very nice phone and didn't have to lock ourselves into a contract because we brought our own phone.
Got AT&T logo and s/w. Will return it.
"I just received my unit shipped from ""Mango Wireless"". It is AT&T branded, and appears as if the box has been opened (although the screen cover was still intact and all parts were present, maybe the last purchaser returned it for the same reason). Amazon's return service is great, and they're one day shipping me a replacement. Will update review when I get the new unit.Update: New unit from Cell Surfers has the same issue. Will be ordering the one sold by Amazon for a replacement."
"Tailwind International was the seller.After checking with Motorola agent, this phone is almost a year old (ship date). Motorola will NOT honor the warranty (It expires in a few months) unless there is a machine # on the receipt (which is not on an Amazon receipt)The phone itself is AT&T locked (insignia in the back and slight bloatware).I kept as after long hassle with Motorola the agent said they will honor the amazon receipt (despite their policy), but who knows if the RMI department will honor it - remain to be seen (I will keep you posted, its unlikely).BTW Neither AT&T nor T-mobile recognized the IMEI (/ESN)P.S. its an amazing device minus the yellowish whites."
I purchased this phone for my wife almost two months ago and she absolutly loves it! Her favorite part of the phone is the camera. We have two little ones under two so trying to get every moment captured often ends up as a blurry mess usually. But not with the Moto X!!
"Nice size. Very responsive. OK Google now is a gimmick, does not work all the time. It is never equal to typing your search words. But, this phone is listed as 'Unlocked'. But, mine came branded with AT&T logo and had AT&T apps installed. I have requested a return. Let me see what happens. I bought from company named 'MyParana'. I did not want to spend money to sign up with T-Mobile to find out this phone will work or not (None of the people I know have nano-SIM from non-AT&T carrier). So, chose the safe method to return it immediately.I do not like how they advertise as 'not-carrier associated' and send you branded stuff."
"I really wanted to love this phone and I did for the most part. If the phone had worked reliably for calls I would have given it 5 stars. The unit is very fast and handled all apps I handled with ease and is much better then other Android phones for hands free use due to the always on mic. Battery life was a bit anemic I would have to charge the unit mid day but I am a heavy user. Small form factor with nice size screen and great built in features like Moto Assist which can be set to detect driving, read messages, and send out a standard text message to let others know your on the road.All in All Motorola did very well on the sleek and powerful phone. The reason I had to downgrade to 2 stars was that often when placing a call, the call would end immediately unless you rebooted. Also even when in perfect reception many calls wouldn't show up in history and went straight to VM. In addition to that for my unit if a caller called me while I was on another call I could no longer hear the conversation I was already on. T-Mobiles Engineers were not able to help, we tried a new SIM card disabling Moto Assist app and other features with no change in the problem behavior for voice calls. This problem did not occur on my former phone on the same network or my temp phone I'm on now.On the app side this worked great for everything from viewing security cameras, Visual Voicemail, GPS by voice using Google now without touching the phone which makes it great for people on the road a lot like me.The problem might be with T-Mobile and the Moto X, I noticed complaints about the same issues on their forums as well as some of the Android developer forums. Regardless those issues were a show stopper for me as I can't miss work calls. I hope others have better luck and would like to see what people say with other networks such as ATT, possibly this device would be fantastic with Verizon or ATT.Update 7/13: I've been following the Android forums closely and apparently the call problems are impacting phones with the latest versions of Kit Kat across multiple carriers including the dialer app service needing to be restarted or calls fail to the ""call ended"" msg. Not everyone is affected but its certainly a percentage of the devices experiencing the behavior I had. The Issues started for me after the 4.4 update, I plan to order a customized version from Motorola and test with the stock OS, if it works I will disable the updates on the phone and use it in stock mode. If the issue is with the software and not hardware then Motorola cant be faulted for that. Also I found that the problems impact the Google Nexus phones as well once they have been updated. Google needs to get on top of these issues and fully test their updates before releasing them. I will post again after I test my stock device and if the results are different then that may be the temp solution until a patched OS is released."
"Ok first off this is a Moto X that does work perfect, that being said there is no way this is a new phone. It has an ATT logo on the back and has ATT preloaded software on it. That should not be the case if this is a factory unlocked phone from Motorola. Also the accessories inside are not Motorola branded, just random POS earbuds, and USB cable. I did make sure I purchased this straight from Amazon instead of a 3rd party seller too. It is unlocked though as I put my Tmobile SIM card in it and it works. So in the end, yes it works and it's unlocked but this is not a 'new' phone :( Can't recommend this be bought from here because it's not what it's advertised as.UPDATE: 5/21/14 I called Amazon about the phone not being a new phone and they apologized and they cross shipped me another with overnight shipping at no extra cost. The new one I received is an actual brand new Moto X from Motorola with no carrier branding, just how it was supposed to be."
"Overall the phone is good, but there are some features that I do not like about it. There is no radio application on it, I tried to download the application but it needs internet connection all the time. I recommend this phone for those who don't care about listening to the radio ....."
"Great, my first android phone, so loving it. Easy to use good photo quality. Touch screen is good. Loving it."
"I needed a device that would let me make calls and listen to text messages without touching my phone. I read many reviews on CNET and PhoneDog, and they seemed to indicate that, while not having the most cutting-edge specs, the specs it did have made it fully worth its price. Moto X's Touchless Control works as advertised. I'm able to do what I need to do while driving without touching the phone at all. The ""Always-On"" technology means it's always listening for my voice, it can tell when I'm driving and will ask if I want to listen to incoming messages, which it plays through my Bluetooth headset or on speakerphone, if I'm not wearing my Bluetooth. I charge my phone overnight and get about 15-16 hours of battery life before it reaches 15%, at which point I plug it in to recharge. Although you have the ability to migrate apps from your current phone, I highly recommend skipping the Migrate option and start from scratch, so you have a chance to see what the phone can do, before you choose to add third-party launchers and other apps that might interfere with the software supplied with the phone. Bloatware is not an issue, here. The Moto X has 16GB of storage, and comes preloaded with only around 4GB of its own software...but, unlike a lot of phones, the software that Motorola supplies is software I like and use on a daily basis. Also, Google's Camera App has recently updated to make picture-taking easier and faster than before, so--despite the fact that Google sold Motorola to Lenovo, support for this phone is still there, and I highly recommend putting this phone on your shortlist for Android phones, and the prices drops more and more. Moto X is a five-star performer."
"It's a very good phone, it's fast and powerfull, but the typing is not as good as I expected. The iPhone is better when you are typing."
"Perfect phone! Amazing! Fast response,long batery duration time, beautiful display! The active display let me forget to unlock by pressing power button.Wonderful touchless control! Hope android 5.0 upgrade!"
I totally love this phone. My last one wouldn't do updates this one does! It also works in stores in back walmart unlike my last one ! thank you so much !
"IT'S A PERFECT SIZE FOR ME, I DON'T LIKE BIG PHONE, THIS ONE IS MORE FLEXIBLE ON HAND! AND IT'S CHEAPPPP!!!"
I purchased the Moto X for my wife. She seems to like the phone and how it functions. Two bad points do exist. I don't believe you can replace the battery so it is a throw away like most everything. Also you cannot add a SIM card for additional memory. This is to force the owner into using Google storage services for those who have extensive music librarys or memory stores. I love my Galaxy S4.
"Loved the phone. Feels good in hand compared to Nexus 5 . You can see and feel quality. Loved the notifications, and the voice control is the best I've seen. Photos has bluish tint, but it doesn't matter for me."
I love it.
Amazing
Excellent phone... all Android software works perfect! Full configuration. Battery very good if some apps. are well configured.
Camara trasera dañada.
LOVE THIS PHONE SO FAR SO GOOD
"I really like this phone - still learning, but fairly easy. It seems to have a nice battery life."
"I love my Moto X, is a smarphone amazing!! very beauty and very faster with apps and software. Have android 4.4 KITKAT is perfect. Sincerely I recommend this cellphone."
"cell excellent, nothing to envy to a high-end"
"I'm very happy with this phone so far. I have had it for about 4 months, and I've been pleasantly surprised by what a good phone it is.Pros:*HDR mode takes beautiful landscape photos. Most of the photos I took on a trip to hawaii were in HDR mode, and they looked truly breathtaking.* Scrolling feels smooth* I haven't broken it yet. I broke a S3 and S4 within 90 days of purchase.* Good price* Good looking screen. Colors are vibrant and brightCons:*Average battery life(10-12 hrs with light to medium use), although certain google apps like maps will completely kill your battery."
good
Charging port was damaged out of the box
Good Phone and works as expected.
10 points
Love this phone.
Nice phone
Nice!!!
I had a great experience buying this phone thru the dealer via Amazon. The price and the product quality was exactly what I had in mind and all work and worked perfectly. Thank you.
"I was a bit concerned because the phone was labeled 'Verizon', and, the product specifications indicated that the phone wasn't compatible with T-Mobile. I took the phone to my local T-Mobile store and they did a couple quick updates to the settings and everything works as expected. Love the performance and weight."
The paperweight Product I have never not worked. I discovered that if you turn it on and let it update will not work. This is a misleading offer.
It is not a XT1058. It is a XT1056. it's disappointing..
"Phone was described as unlocked model but what I received was AT&T branded (slightly different bands). While it will work for me, it may have issues when used internationally."
A little glitchey
"Great phone for the price! Bought the unlocked version on my own, independent of any carrier. Using it with Consumer Cellular service. Takes great photos!"
"Really grew to love this phone over time. My only regret was not getting the 32 or even 64gb model. It's fine though because I can use my USB OTG cable and 64gb flash drive for added music and videos. You learn to appreciate the added features that Motorola has included especially the Moto Assist. I am looking forward to the release of the Moto X+1 and will keep my 16gb X as a backup. Near vanilla version of Android Kit Kat makes this an ideal phone. I used to have gripes about the camera, but it still takes great outdoor shots and videos."
Excellent
Excellent phone. The best phone I ever had.
Awesome Phone.... this is a great phone from Motorola
"NOT FIT FOR BUSINESS USE - OR ADULTS, EITHER! The Moto X is an AWFUL DISAPPOINTMENT for an upper-tier smartphone... Here's why:Google-owned Motorola just can't seem to get it right with the Moto X. The battery life is sub-standard; the camera function and photo quality were acceptable BEFORE the latest Google-forced Android update, Kit-Kat 4.4.3, but unusable after. The 4.4.3 update also ruined the dialer function with an ugly and dysfunctional replacement and revised the graphical user interface to look like more like a kindergarten toy or Windows-type, Tile-based phone - UGLY, STUPID and CHILDISH!!! Because Google forces the updates on you with no way to go back to the system that came with the phone, I returned both of them for a refund."
Great phone.
"Software is evolving.. and the potential is huge. It's google, so I feel like you can actually participate to the dev of the smartphone (software).Hardware is ok, good shape, a little big for my small hands, sound and calls ok, touchscreen very good, usb tethering works more or less (microsoft win 7) but hotspot works perfect.In a nutshell, I love it, but it has fallen down 3 times and the 3rd time the screen broke.Good thing to know : If you customize it online they replace the screen once for free.Battery time is still a problem for every smartphone. If you use google nav as a gps, get the gear to plug it.I definitely recommend it."
"Display sometime disappears. No button press would bring the display back. Only after a few retries it would be back.Voice quality is not good.However, it is a very sleek and light weght."
"I can't praise enough this cellphone, it is lightweight, fast, really smart. The only issue is that I have an accent so it doesn't quite get what I'm saying so I have to talk slowly, other than that I love love love my phone!"
"the phone is just beautiful, well made, so black and so smooth, perfectly fit my handit works outside US with a foreign sim card, even has 4Gafter updating it has android 4.4.2"
"Very pleasure to recommend Moto X.smoosh,clevercleansafeEnergy savingIts my first time to buy SmartPhone from Amazon US.An interesting experience"
"Great phone, very rugged and easy to use. The voice recognition features are a plus and makes it stand alone among other Android phones. Solind construction by Mototola."
I dropped it down on the floor in the street after three days I had received.then there was trouble with my motox .quick acquire did not work.now I decide to buy one once more.because It can work but its not beautiful any more.perhaps motox need a case
This phone is just awesome! Touchless control and active display is wonderful ideas. Performance is on medium side. Overall is very good phone.
"what a great phone! you cant miss it😊(^_^)my friend like it very much, and the price i got it is very cheap"
The phone is exactly what is advertised. I am enjoying this nice gift. I like the hand size of my phone. I choose this phone over all iPhones. Thank you Motorola.
"I was crazy about this phone before I was able to buy it and it really is amazing, the touchless controls are really easy to use and it's one of the features I use the most of the phone. The phone itself works really good, I haven't seen lag while using it, it's pretty fast to browse and I'm pretty satisfied with the purchase on a ""specs"" matter.I highly recommend this phone to everyone, Active display, Touchless controls and the Camera shake to start are unique features on the market right now (which don't drain the battery at all).100% happy with this purchase (a month use, I honestly would miss a lot of things if I change my phone in 2014, which I don't think I will considering the phone I have)"
"Solid phone, especially great if you don't like the trend for the large phones. This one is a bit smaller. The only downside is that it doesn't have an SD slot. But it's a great deal for the cost. Performance is very good."
"The phone itself is very nice, but I got a refurbished version, when it CLEARLY STATED it was a new phone! Also, the charger was not for US."
Everything was as advertised
Unsure says it unlocked but has AT&T logo on phone I have not tried on another service yet. Other than that it was perfect.
All excellent
"Great Phone! Best interactive features yet, way better then Siri.Voice commands for sending text and making calls and even setting up reminders or appointments!The only down fall is the tiny tiny mic... if your have the drive feature on the phone activated it has a hard time understanding you. So if you get a call it's hard to answer hands free. It will ask you if you want to answer or reply with a text but then does nothing unless the car is dead quite"
This phone is complete trash photos have a glow to them WiFi won't work this is a waste of money no wonder Motorola has no sales this phone sucks
Great phone
Everything was excellent. I got the phone from a third party and everything was good except it didn't come with Motorola branded charger or the device to open the sim tray but other then that it was excellent.
"This is one of the best phones a have ever used. No lag what so ever. The camera is a little weak when compared with an I phone, but at half the cost, who can argue? The shortcut gestures are really handy. The battery life is amazing for something this smooth! My one complaint is that the seller I bought mine from have me an ATT phone that was unlocked, rather than the stock unlocked one you can buy from Motorola. The only difference is an ATT logo on the back and some ATT bloatware wasting your internal storage on your phone. Annoying, but not enough for me to ship back and have to wait a few more days to get the unbloated one."
Meet up with expectations
"Excellent phone, fast, great screen and awesome camera. I'm very happy with it."
The rear camera of the phone don't work
Excellent
"Nice device, it looks and work fine."
"excelent,A+++"
Great phone!
"excellent phone, everything went very quickly, served in Venezuela currently movisrar I use with it is the best phone I've had, I recommend"
"Hi, I Bought this item in April, only used to talk, texting and internet, yesterday comes a software update 4.4.3, after installation my phone ""brick"" screen in black an d not respose, no charge, is dead!!! What can i do? I don't ""Modd"" the phone!!!!"
Good product.
Love it. Touchless controls are great.
Very fast phone. Value for money
Excelente funtions and fast
"i was standing holding this phone, it slipped from my hands and dropped on the ground from almost 1 feet. Its screen was broken like brittle glass and motorola asks for 125 USD for replacing the screen. appears to me that material quality is very cheap, hence i wouldn't buy this product again"
"An unlocked phone offers an excellent way to get a phone of your choice and use it on a network of your choice. While the Moto X was still being made in the US of A, I decided to buy one (patriotism!) knowing that the companies behind it are formidable ones in their technical repertoire and I was already done with my iPhone 4S, which seemed dated in comparison to bigger screened phones which seemed sleeker than the 4S.So far, it has been a blast. I bought a second one from Motorola with 32 GB memory, as they had a special for that one.Very solid phone and zero troubles so far .... except perhaps one -- I could not set up the phone to act as a data conduit for my coporate VPN."
"Loved it, new in the box, everything's working perfectly."
"The telephone goes on, but it requires an unlock code. The telehone was sold as an unlocked one, but when I put the nano sim card, I must write an unlock code. I strongly request the unlock code, otherwise this mobile is useless. Thanks."
"The phone is quite ok. However, the customer care at Motorola was not so helpful. Unfortunately my phone display just crashed and I had to call up motorola to get a replacement. Even though they sent me a replacement, the new phone had defects too, causing it to reboot every few hours.I had to again call back motorola and had to go through a lot of explanation and really had to explain the customer agent for about 40 minutes.In the end, all my excitement for this phone died seeing the defective replacement phone and the kind of customer service I received. For once I felt I am speaking to a machine as they were only repeating what they were to say. Even talking to an escalation manager did not help. I have my doubts if I really spoke to a human on the other end.Just waiting for the replacement phone to arrive so I can sell it to some one and move on from Motorola."
Lo maximo
Great phone
"Good day , I bought this phone from Venezuela and thought I was released because the publication says so , however , here in Venezuela does not work with any of the telephone operators (Digitel , Movistar, Movilnet ) , I asked for help from Motorola and I said I should contact the seller and to put to the problem to see what form can be resolved in the system motorola is recorded only to be used by AT&T USA ."
"Nice phone, very fast, perfect size and easy to hold, one minor thing the sound could be better."
awsome product. i recommend
Love my hands free voice activated phone. Camera pretty bad for the price but convenience of not having to touch my phone makes it totally worthwhile. Good battery. Nice screen. Prefer SD port .....so my next moto will have that and praying for a better camera.
Exactly as described.
Mine wasn't AT&T Unlocked but a Verizon one. Came with a huge sticker on the back and the Verizon logo printed on the back plate.Works great in Ecuador with all the operators. Great phone by Motorola and inexpensive.
Very good condition! Very good price! Works as described and shipping was fast!
"The cellphone works excellent, just great. And the charger looks original."
"Phone is awesome! you should buy it if you want power and compact size, almost run all that i throw it!"
How did I ever do without it before? Very happy with my first smart phone.
"Great phone for anyone but especially those who want an easy phone to use (when Android typically can be complicated). It's quick, good for one handed use, great screen, decent camera."
I love my new phone and it works perfectly. I was hesitant to order from online. Breaking being damaged already but this is in perfect condition.
"I bought it refurbished and it was only a little over two hundred dollrs.I'd like to make it simple.I get 5+ screen time on battery life. It's very smooth.Screen is nice but if you are planning on using during sunny day, it's not that well visible."
"This mobile phone seems to address many of mine and probably most of other users expectations regarding functionality and user friendliness. It seems to me that Motorola/Google did a deep research on previous Android functionality issues and solved most of them, The processor is fast, the operating system reliable and its innovations are easy to grasp and become familiar with. The only remaining issue in my opiinion is its 16 GB RAM limit. Despite of that, I recommend this cel phone."
Excellent cell. Pretty fast. Slim and lightweight. Your problem is that the front glass is delicate and is glued to the LCD. When repair is complicated.
"I was afraid it would be a Chinese copy but it actually came in the original box, brand new, perfect conditions and even Before the estimated day!The only thing is the battery is lately draining faster than the first days. Could be cause of the amount of apps.Anyway, good product!"
"Nice balance of firm and flexible materials. Good grip. While the on/off switch and volume control are covered (protected) and require a little extra effort, they are perfectly functional."
Moto X - like Nexus 5 but with better camera (even the smaller screen with lower resolution isn't noticeable because it is such a great Android Smart Phone).5 Stars to the Vender (based on TX) for getting the Moto X shipped out via FedEx Ground so quickly - do I care if the cable / plug is white? No because I can see that in the dark (grins) ....
"I love the Moto X. It has all the things i need and a much bigger screen, plus i bought it for half the price of an iPhone! Highly recommended!"
This phone is suppose to be unlocked version but it is AT&T version with SKU 6130A. There is AT&T branding on the back as well as AT&T apps and software that you cannot uninstall. I will return this item as it is misrepresented.
Great phone!
Amazing!
So far so good using this phone on the T-Mobile network. AT&T contacts application pops up and is not real easy to get rid of so you have to do a little research to get around some of AT&T leftovers if you're not using their network.
love it. cheap and usefull
Produto excelente! Best Seller! Very quikly
"Great phone for its price range, I was really thinking hard if it was worth ordering it with the risk of getting a used & branded phone like one of the reviews on here but everything went great, it was really quick shipping, it comes with Jellybean 4.4.2 I love kit kat so I installed ask the updates right away & took me less than 20 minutes to update to KitKat 4.4.4 in very looking forward to Lollipop 5.0 hopefully this year, the phone itself is great, I didn't notice any lag time, it's very snappy. I know a lot of people worry about the 16 GB but it comes with 50 GB of Google drive for free for 2 years which is great. The screen feels really smooth & the back goes into my hand easily & very snug. The camera is good indoors, I still have yet to go outside but I'm not an outdoors person. Overall this phone is great & I would recommend it. cheers"
Best gadget to own
Arrived early. Works great. Amazing phone!
Very good!
"It is XT1053Б, not XT1058"
I got this phone after the previous phone I got suddenly broke. The shipping was fast but when I got it there was a weird sticker that left some sort of residue on the front that only came off with a magic eraser. Also the front facing camera does not work at all and makes every other app that uses the camera (like snapchat) to crash. It was great since I was in a pickle but I wouldn't buy again.
it was inoperative..... I had to return it...
Great phone. Check that it works with your provider though
I am very disappointed with this phone. I love Motorola phones but this has been a total disaster of a phone.
It was not knew as advertised
Excelente
Excelent
very good phone .very fast.it run all the apps perfecly.i give 5 starts because i really like it.....
I really hated this phone. I am much happier with Samsung Galaxy 5
"Best phone ever made. I'd never had such an awesome experience with a smartphone until the Moto X. Runs smoothly. Clean OS. Runs games well. Amazing color quality. Very durable. I wish I had bought this phone when it first came out. Only drawback is the lack of an SD slot. After having the phone a while, you miss it on the 16GB version."
"The stock stuff in there was depleting the battery fast; a factory reset took care of that.The inner back of the phone is supposed to be glued together; it isn't.The right side edge of the screen should feel smooth as you move your finger against the plastic, outer frame; it doesn't.I don't know if the vendor or Motorola is to blame, but I bought a ""new"" phone and it should not have those issues.It is OK for it's purpose."
"Using it now, love it! Moto rocks"
excellent
Good price!
Excellent phone
"Love it! it's light weight, easy to carry and easy to use."
Una estafa
"read all the reviews you want,do all the research you want.HANDS DOWN,THE BEST PHONE DEVICE ANYWHERE NEAR THIS PRICEPOINT"
Just what I wanted!
Very good
"It's used and is not new. Mine came with a song or two on the corner. Other than that, it works perfectly and I love how fast this phone operates."
The phone probably works great but it wasn't in the condition as specified by the seller so I returned it.
excellent
"the phone, now, work very goog. it's everything that i want. but i had a problem with the APN. i had to investigate so much to make work the 2G/3G/4G.Someone who doesn't know very much about tecnology, is posible that doesn't know how to turn on the 2g/3g/4g. I WAS LUCKY.I WAS VERY ANGRY THAT NO ONE NOTIFY ME THAT THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. I lost all the day investigating.Fortunately I found the solution. Without your help"
The Q&A says this phone is unbranded. I received a Verizon Moto X with an unlockable bootloader. Spend 30 bucks more and buy a Moto X from someone else.
good phone for beginners. smaller than I thought it would be. Still have to figure out voicemail. Have to constantly push on button. I would not purchase this phone. It was represented as a second generation which it was not. Not a good phone for pre-paid.
Great product!
"I bought this ""factory unlocked"" and it came with verizon marks and verizon things installed. Also came with a different color sim slot. I have some troubles with me cellphone company here in argentina now."
"While I love the Moto X 2013 model, this one did not come as advertised. I purchased a new model, and thought I was receiving an XT1058 (which is what I originally searched for). Meanwhile, I received an XT1060 (Verizon model) and it was clearly a refurbish - nothing in the package was standard for this phone, the screen protector was badly scuffed, and there were odd bits of tape and glue on it."
"this is a great cell phone! sound, camera and everything is really nice!"
great
"A wonderful phone, work good with our Movistar 4G service in Venezuela, better than my Samsung Ace 2 phone.Excellent seller"
"Great phone for a cheap price. I bought this to replace a broken Xperia Z1 Compact. It is only slightly larger and I don't even notice it running slower than the Z1-C while it has a slower processor. It still runs games like normal and usual phone functions are great. Only downside is that it isn't waterproof like the xperia, but that isn't what broke my xperia anyway.Also it works with T-mobile 4G-LTE in USA."
I bought the 32 GB like five months ago. That one had factory issues and i had to send it back.. And now i got de 16 GB. Im very satissfied.
excellent
Very good
phone wouldnt stop restarting smh.
Good! Im very glad with it!
"Phone was exactly what I wanted, the price was right, the shipping was prompt, I am very pleased with this purchase!"
I am very disappointed with this purchase. was not sealed packaging and accessories are not original. seems a used phone.
"I think the product met my needs and requirements, I need not to stop on four stars but for the fact that I'm yet to understand the full features of Moto X. Therefore, I reserve the remaining star for future rating. By and large I recommend Moto X for travellers and field workers.Dr. Ugbah, G."
"Excellent phone, great in-hand feel. Now with KitKat too ...There are a lot of reviews available on the phone, so i won't bore you with repeating what is good and what is not.What i will tell you is that what Amazon wasn't able to answer me, nor it was available in the phone description, the carrier compatibility of the black version of the unlocked Moto X with warranty in US. I've called/chatted with Amazon support several times to figure out which model of Moto X i'm about to purchase and Amazon support couldn't tell me. Amazon doesn't have any idea what are they selling. The Amazon CSR's were telling me that i should talk to Motorola so i can figure out what i'm about to purchase. I've spoke to Motorola support and they couldn't tell me either ... Went back to Amazon support chat and the CSR spotted a note in the description of the phone that i didn't catch before, so here it is: ""Please Note: This a U.S. Cellular device. You can however unlock this phone quite easily. It is brand new in the box."" I'm thinking, i'm about to purchase an unlocked gsm phone that is for US Cellular?! Really?! I'm on AT&T, but this spiked my curiosity, knowing that if i order this phone (knowing that is for US Cellular, as per that note in the phone description) and if i do not open it i can return it and get my money back. So, i've decided to purchase it (regardless the note telling me it won't work on ATT because is supposedly US Cellular device). When the phone arrived, i've called Motorola in hope that they would tell me based on the box markings (Seq #, IMEI, FCC ID and whatnot else) the LTE and WCDMA compatibility of the phone i just bought. Well, they couldn't ... They told me that they need a serial number and that is not on the box ... I needed to break the seal and turn on the phone so i can figure out if it will work on ATT or not. At this point i do not need Amazon and Motorola's help if i need to break the seal, i can just stuff the sim card in it and turn it on. Well, based on the FCC ID i guessed that what i've received was XT1053, which is T-Mobile's model, so i've decided to break the seal and turn it on (forget about Amazon and Motorola CSR's). I can inform you that what i've received is the model XT1053, unlocked and compatible with ATT LTE and WCDMA./Rant Off"
"Fast, works well, good design. Battery life gets me through at least a day of typical use with bright screen, and often 2 days.I had to cut down my existing micro-SIM card to fit inside but I managed to do that with a pen, a pair of scissors and a small piece of sandpaper."
"This phone rocks. From the quick display, ease of use. Camera ready at just a flick of the wrist. Voice searching without even touching the phone. Excellent. Love Android!"
"The phone supports only 3 languages (in its system dialogs), as opposed to dozens and dozens for comparable Samsung models for example. Very strange propopsition in the globalised world. I am returning to Samsung."
I love it. It is just better than iPhone for me.
"I purchased this phone in april, and it stop working already,can not charge it.....contact the seller, no answer, contact samsung and they can not help it is manufactured in south africa, i will never purchase anything from this seller again!!!"
I returned the first one because the free google GB storage were ALREADY REDEAMED. I returned the product waited andAgain got a a motorola moto x xt1058 with the GB storage on google EXPIRED .beware phony robbery !!!!
very good
"I got a refurbished version, when it CLEARLY STATED it was a new phone!"
"I DISSATISFIED WITH MOBILE PHONE YOU BUY, AS RELEASED bid LO LO SHIPPING TO VENEZUELA AND LOCKED, IF YOU CAN THANK THE PROBLEM . PLEASE CONTACT ME . ATTE WANDA MEJIA"
"The phone is very comfortable nice features of the camera - twist the phone twice, 2 RAM, LTE , 1.7 DUAL CORE - if it were 4 cores it was a amazing!every thing is working great except the lollipop"
EXCELENTE
"It's a awesome phone, but after one month it started to get slow and hot also.... it's being a little unconfortable because it's really hot... sometimes i think that it will burn in fire at any moment...It works pretty well in south america.. i'm living in Brazil and it works pretty good"
"I have always migrated to Motorola phones, I just received this moto x on Saturday and I'm totally in love. I was thinking about buying another brand but I decided to stick with my first love. My next upgrade will be the moto X 2nd generation. Great buy too!!!"
Excellent product thank you is beautiful
Excellent
"Such a great product, loved the phone, the UI, the screen and the quick google updates."

ok
The cellphone is an At&t phone with all At&t apps. The title is incorrect.
It is an amazing phone
amazing phone!
this phone meet my expetctations
Grat!
Amazing phone.
Excellent product
"its simply incredible, by far, the best phone i ever had in my life"
All was perfect!
"Excellent! Absolutely new XT1095, very beautiful with bamboo back cover. Powerful, with last Android version."
"Thank you for my smartphone . I am very glad that everything worked very well . Thank you for your prompt delivery and excellent , high-quality goods!"
Well. You told me. I didn't listen. Two days. One feet high... Broken Glass.
"I love the Moto X second Gen for its speedy performance due to it's snapdragon 801, and its amazing display due to its amoled 1080p hd. However no device is perfect and neither is this one, as it lacks a powerful battery, or an amazing camera, but it works and that is not why I gave this product four stars. I gave it four stars due to my products lack of build quality. It was strong but the bamboo was weak and coming off from the bottom. My phone still scratches very easily when putting it in my pocket, I found out it was sand and.... I work in a geotech company.... Besides those two flaws, I love my new phone..."
"Love this phone. Graduated from the Moto G and preciously and iPhone 5 and previously iPhone 4 and 3G. Best phone I've used out of those. Not the highest end specs but phone has a ton of nice but non-overwhelming features. Only minor complant is the Moto Voice doesn't always pick up my voice, but at the bar last night kept cutting on when I never said anything close to my keywords, I've turned that off and went with standard Google now 'OK Google'. 100% RECOMMEND."
Awesome!
Excellent
Great phone
Great phone at a Great price. It was a Verizon phone originally tho not Att as the ad specified. The seller offered a refund tho so buy with confidence.
"my first moto x, everything works well so far except for the camera, it is incredibly difficult to have the camera come into focus, i have to move it close, away, close, away, to try and have the focus come out clear. the pictures are fine once i can get the camera in focus."
"This phone has the worst sreen i ever had. Don t buy it, it s too fragile.Now i have to replace it and cost, half the phone."
"I think i wasnt luck this time...i bought two of theese...one of them get brickes after two days and four software upgrades... Had to return it...the other one is perfect...great size, great speed and featured... Im using it in argentina without any kind of problem."
Excellent phone. Very good cost benefit. Higly recomended.
Perfect
"So I gave it a few weeks and at this point I must say I am very pleased with my Moto X 2nd Gen. It is very quick and smooth, take pictures well and calls are crystal clear. It has "" learned "" my voice and responds as well as any iPhone I have seen.It fits my hand and pocket well, screen is large enough for me ( I wouldn't want it much larger if at all ). I still have much to learn in the Android platform but as for the phone itself, I have no complaints. I was worried about battery life but thus far it has been very good for my use ( not a ultra heavy user tho ) and lasts me all day and well into the next."
I love this phone. Absolutely could not beat the price when I got it. I have had this phone for a just over a month now and here are my pros/cons.Pros:Great quality buildHigh Screen-to-Body %The AMOLED screen is crisp and so black that sometimes I can't discern the screen from the front fascia border.Moto Assist. I am now spoiled by the motion activated screen for checking notifications.Cons:Battery life is not very good. I just had to increase my charging frequency. Drains especially fast during continuous use.Moto Assist. The screen basically turns on whenever something passes over it not just a hand.
"Why is xt1097, instead xt1095"
"excellent seller, arrived quickly and as described, satisfied with my cell"
Perfect! And arrived sooner than expected!
"I found out when i went to get this phone fixed that I was sold a pre used phone. I fully thought I was paying for a new unused phone. anyways the phone didn't last a week, the screen will not turn on and I'm told it's 200 dollars plus to replace. might as well just buy a new phone."
Everything was fine!
"Great phone. pure andriod, love their apps. it figures out that you're driving and would tell you when someone is calling or sending you a text.battery lasts a day most of the time."
Its an Excellent phone The programms of like AT&T and T-Mobil sometimes are annoying
The phone is great. The connection to the ATT network can be problematic at times even when there are cell towers close by.Bought two phones. One updated to Lollipop 5.1 while the other is still using 5.0. Not sure why the delay in updating the Android software in the other phone. Overall very nice phone that could someday earn five stars if service connection problems are addressed.
Make sure you do NOT buy from Open Group Wireless! Even though the model is shown as XT1095 I received an XT1092 which will NOT work properly (above 2G) on US GMS networks!I made the mistake of only looking at reviews after purchasing from them. Others have reported the same problem!
Excellent!!!!
Excellent !!!
"Very good cell phone, althought it is very expensive replacement of your screen if broken"
"Great phone... I thought it works in 4g antennas in LatAm but it doesn't.reagarding performance, it is the greater the quicker as expected. Very good phone."
Love this phone had one just like it and I accidentally sat on it so I bought a new one just like it love the bamboo cover wish the screen was larger but the phone is great
"So far so good. I like it. The only thing that caused a little problem is I had to order a ""nano"" SIM card. I was not able to simply take my old SIM card out and insert it in the new phone. I will try and update several months from now..."
The product was everything that I expected from the description. The phone works great and very pleased with the speed of delivery.
"excellent phone, very good price and quality. Four good"
very true to description. Got to say I am pleased so far.
"This phone breaks easily. There's a reason they stopped selling it. Not to mention the description didn't say that ""unlocked"" does NOT mean ""Verizon compatible"". I wasted my money on a rubbish phone that I couldn't use."
Received it quickly works as well as the phone it replaced.
"I upgraded from the Moto G. This phone has a lot of similar features since it is also a Motorola, but some of the new things I like are:- Wave your hand over the phone to see time/notifications- Quick glance of notifications without unlocking- Voice feature (Can ask questions, even when locked)- ""Talk to me"" feature - phone will read all notifications out loud for 30 mins. Perfect for when you're in the shower/doing dishes/etc.- Much better camera than the Moto G- Motion sensor actions (twist twice to open camera, karate chop down twice for flashlight)Overall, it just has some neat added features. It has been a tiny bit laggy at times, which is annoying (ex. going to Google search bar and the keyboard takes a few seconds to come up). But overall, I really like it."
"It's a really good cellphone but it doesn't support sd card, and the gallery doesn't offer to many options, for example you can't hide an album"
good a pure android phone
"Shipped very fast, great phone"
Turning off the moto features will keep the phone cool otherwise it burns like hell.
The leather back gets full scratches.It says it has 16 gig but it only has 10 gig. False advertising!!
Fantastic!
"I had the first generation Moto X for two years. Used to love it, the size, the speed, the practicality of a compact phone with decent performance. I decided to go with the second gen, amidst the launch of the third generation due to the size, specs, and price. So far I've been impressed. I'll admit that I'm still getting used to the larger screen, but this phone sure is fast. The bear stock Android experience is a welcome addition, and the small enhancements Motorola added to it are more than welcomed. If you're looking for a great phone and a low cost and want it to simply work, get this one. The camera is ho-hum, I've seen better. But for my needs, its more than adequate."
"The best mid-range Android phone in my opinion.Pros:- Nice screen. Bright, vivid, responsive.- Good quality body- Nice camera- Fast charging battery- Sound quality is good- Very clean Android (nearly default experience)- An extra chip just to track movement and respond.Cons:- Only one: Default launcher is not good. But you can install from tons of choices from Google Play. I prefer KK Launcher."
"Best phone I had so far. Moved to it from a OnePlus One, which was good, but a little too big."
Probably the best smartphone out there. Love the bamboo in the back.. Super fast and really smooth. Colors are awesome and camera is great too..
Good quality phone easy to use.
"Beautiful bamboo back, decent battery life, a bit on the larger side compared to Moto X 2013, great Android experience that is close to vanilla."
Excelent!!
Amazing phone.
"This phone is a piece of crap, I have purchased 2 hoping that the broken headphone jack was just luck, but the jack broke on my second phone immediately after the return warranty was up. If you want to use headphones with this phone EVER. Do not consider buying."
I love it! Everything about this phone is great! Highly recommend if you want a good reliable phone that feels premium and performs great.
ok
Great
One of the biggest mistakes I did is to buy this phone on Amazon. Till date since buying the phone in early July I have not been able to place more than 5% of my calls and still have not received a single call on this phone. All the calls drop each and every time. And when i do receive a call not able to pick it up. The dialler functionality to receive calls is horrible. I tried calling motorolla for help regarding this issue and I was told to do a hard reset on the device which I did but the problem still persists.Shame on Motorolla and Amazon to sell such horrible devices.
Awesome phone for the price! Love it! Great for everyday tasks and use. Long battery life.
Great phone
Great cellphone. Great price. Delivery occurred in 2 days (with Amazon Prime).
I was looking for a replacement for my broken Gen 1 Moto X (which I loved). If this phone were slightly smaller it would be perfect.
Very good cell phone!
Overall it's a pretty decent case. My only complaint is that it is loose around the power button and volume rocker. Besides that it's comfortable to hold and has a good looking design
"Perfect phone. Switched over to Sprint for the iPhone 4 Ever plan, so had to return it."
"Fast, good battery life, decent camera. Amazon deal of the day at $199."
"The phone is sleek, lightweight and user friendly and the performance is great. But it looks like its a used/returned item. have few dents on the leather, and the protective screen is not intact (Its advertised as brand new though)."
"The phone's performance is what was expected. But beware of Amazon, this phone looked like it was a returned. The back plate had some dents to it and the plastic screen cover had dust bubbles. Obviously it was taken out of the box. When you buy something labeled as Brand New it ought to be Brand New!"
"Good cellphone for the price. Just the camera is not as good as you expect from a modern phone, when it is a bit dark the camera just take bad pictures, and also it is difficult to focus. But I had already known it before buying, so this is not a problem."
Great!
Excellent device. Worth the money.
"I did not receive the charger, charger cable, or the sim removal tool along with my phone. The package says it should also include those items. Hopefully I already have the sim card in my phone."
"BEST PHONE I`VE EVER OWNED!The Moto X was a great flagship smartphone in it`s launch date back in 2014, the price at that time was OK, but now with this price cut value is really amazing. When you think about not only the specs but also the software and quality this smartphone has to offer theres no much really any major brand smartphone that catches up to this level.Main pros:PerformanceSpecificationsDesignQualityMoto functionsAmoled 5.2 inch displayCons:Battery doesn`t suck but is not the best in it`s segment. It could offer a bigger a bigger battery considering the thickness of the smartphone.Camera:13 Megapixels seem good but the performance in low lighting aren't satisfying."
"Using phone for a month in extreme conditions, dropped on concrete once with bumper, no problems. Software runs smooth and very intuitive."
"Its been just 3hrs since i used it and this is my first impression.Light UI n Much faster- Switching from Samsung S6 to this made me feel much better. S6 has too much bloatware and without many new apps installed, its RAM Is already 86% used and it gets slow with its touchwiz UI. But Moto X is clean, has little bloatware but not too bad. Still has 1GB+ RAM available.Too good for what i paid for - $299 for this phone?? Its bargain... i feel like i bought Nexus 6 or S6 for $299 and for $65 u cud get the Moto extended warranty too!!! Excellent isn't it?"
"great phone, battery backup is also good."
Great phone. Set-up was easy and fun.It has all of the bells and whistles that a flagship phone should have. The price was reasonable and I got a first rate phone.
"You can pretty much get a feel for this phone from reading the specs. Mine is black with the plastic back which is still kind of grippy. Aesthetically, the phone is sexy. It feels really good to hold and look at. That said, for my taste it feels wider than it is long. Obviously it's not, but it's wider than I'd like it to be, minor thing I guess. The camera's good, not great but definitely not as bad as some reviews make it seem. Obviously it doesn't perform as well in low light, which the iPhone is really the only one that does. But you won't be disappointed with this phone, the few things Motorola adds to the software are actually useful. Battery is okay, I'd say average and could definitely be better. But you should make it through the day."
"Pretty decent product with a reasonable price. Strong WiFi detection and stable WiFi connection all the time. It is however a little too big for my hand, but a bigger screen is always desired."
"Been using this phone for a few weeks now and is very user friendly, besides the internet browser. Not sure how to access previous tabs or open new ones, but will figure it out in time. I switched to the Moto X from a Samsung Galaxy S3 and is essentially the same thing minus the Samsung and mobile carrier clutter. Vibrant colors and fast. Get it!P.S. the wood back is definitely a conversation starter and a bragging point for a stylish phone."
Phone was advertised as unlocked but came locked to Verizon. Had to call and get that taken care of before it could be used.
"Everything from the packaging to the phone was just amazing. I got it when it said that it was going to be back in stock at a later sate bbut then the shipping was bumped up to the same week so don't be afraid of the in stock later date.The phone is amazing. Depending on your internet speed, it will take a while for the four updates to take places; it goes from Kitkat, to the latest Lollipop and Marshmallow is expected soon.Apart from that, everything is great from the screen (super bright and vibrant) to the performance (which is impeccable for the price - I got 44000 on Antutu after downloading some apps. It got 30 - 50 FPS in the game region which is great. The phone is just really fast and can compete with the big flagship phones) to the gameplay (which is very fluid with no lag issues on arcade games, haven't tried frame intensive games) to the camera (absolutely amazing especially in apps like Instagram and Snapchat) to the microphones (I could talk to it from a good few feet away in the ideal conditions). The only thing is no SD card slot but everything else is great. Not to mention the cool Moto features and NFC support.3 days updateThe phone is still holding beautifully.It better than ever with around 5GB left in storage (after downloading a lot of games and social media apps). Just monitor your storage so you don't use it up all at once. But as it is, the phone is functioning beautifully and it working like a charm.It still doesn't lag and functions beautifully and the more graphic intensive games like FIFA 15 and easily handles games like Crossy Road with ease. Day to day tasks are even smoother with no stuttering, just fluid actions from opening apps to using them for long periods of time to jumping from one to another; the RAM is holding up spectacularly.I would highly recommend getting a quick charger with it so you can keep it charged. You'll need it if you use your phone alot.All the Moto Actions still work and as time passes, the phone gets to know you better so it appears to work better over time (just make sure all the apps are up to date).Just a really great phone overall. If I had a Micro SD card slot, there'd be nothing stopping it but it does support USB OTG (so to some measure, the phone is perfect)."
works fine............ I don't find GPS
"I bought it for my daughter. She loves the clear display and the OS. She wishes that it supported additional SD memory card. That was her only complaint. The size is good (not too big, not too small). She loves the bamboo feels. Samsung and Apple get most of the media attention when it comes to smartphones, but if you are looking for decent functionality and great value, check out Motorola phones. If someone from Motorola sees this, I should get some compensation (maybe another free phone?) for a positive review, call me ;-)"
Just got my brand new moto x. It's so quick so don't have to wait till my favorite apps open.
"Overall, a nice phone except the extremely yellow screen."
One of the best phone in 2014 and still serve me good. Love everything about this phone except for no micro sd slot and limited internal memory (I got the 16GB model).
Great
Would be nice if Amazon sold the 64GB version too.
"Motorola has figured out the right combination of standard and delightful. Standard in that this is a 99% pure Android phone. Delightful in that there are little Moto surprises that don't get in the way of the Android experience. For example, Spotlight Stories sounds kinda cheesy, but it's cute and fun, so well done.The Moto X (2nd gen) is just the right size. Big enough for photos and videos and Chromecast, small enough to fit in phone pockets popular in men's shorts these days. The screen is amazing. Everything is so responsive. I'm sure this will be perfect for me for a couple of years. Amazing that I could get it off-contract for $300.I put an ArmorSuit MilitaryShield on the screen, and a teal Cruzerlite Bugdroid gel case around the back. I really could not be happier!"
excelent phone! great quality
"This phone is fantastic! For those looking for a flag ship phone on a budget, this is your device!"
"I like the software and the look, it ran perfectly. But the screen cracks very easily and a replacement for these guys is $300. Upon replacement, the proximity sensor stopped working which meant as soon as I made a call, the screen went black and I couldn't end the call (I would leave 10 minute long messages unless I manually turned the phone off).I've had this phone for about 3 or 4 months now and the screen has just started going haywire as well. The image content cycles across the screen like it's on a conveyor belt. I've spent $600 on this phone so far and I've been having chronic problems. For me, I regret making the purchase..."
"Everything was perfect, I got the white/Bamboo combo and it is completly unlock device XT1095, sold and shipped by Amazon.This is the best phone you can get right now a completely unlock device go ahead and give it a try!!"
"I think this is a decent phone. I came from Nexus 5 so I can compare both phones. To me, there isn't much difference. Both phones function the same. I don't notice Moto's bigger screen but lower ppi screen. Both screens look good. I do think the Moto has more contrast though.I am not a fan of where the volume buttons and the power buttons on located. They are on the same side. I think they should be on opposite sides. Or they should've been farther apart. I always hit the power button when I'm trying to increase the volume and vice versa. This is one of my least favorite things about this phone.The little indentation on the back is worthless. I don't understand it. Some people like to rest their finger on it. It doesn't work for me. It's uncomfortable.The camera seems same as Nexus 5's. The ring flash is a nice gimmick. But with a flash that small, there isn't much difference. If they wanted to make a ring flash, the flash should circle the entire phone. Then it can give the distinctive, ring-flash look.I'm not a big fan of the speakers either. They feel like buttons, and I always want to push them. They're rough too.Despite by nit-picks, this is still a great phone. It will serve many people's purpose well for a smart phone."
"I bought this phone late in the game, not long before this year's (2015) iteration will launch, so will skip the overview of all the specs and how it stacks up against its competitors and all that ""I wish I was a tech journalist"" nonsense.I wasn't shopping this phone against its competitors, but its predecessor, the original 2013 release of the Moto X, and several other phones in the $200ish range. I bought it at 229 USD, just 30 more than I could have bought its predecessor as new old stock, but lightly used.It has impressed me so far. I've used a few android devices, including a smartphone (Motorola Droid Razr Maxx 'can we add any more names to this thing?') that I used without a SIM, essentially as a miniature tablet for wifi use with a Motorola Tundra as my talk/text device until the Tundra finally died.So, since it's about to be outdated, why don't we look at this phone in detail, but without the ""brand new shiny thing"" glasses of release day, and from the perspective of someone who has used, but not relied upon, smartphones for some time.First, it looks good. In my case, with a white front and bamboo back, I like it, even if I'm not a fan of white on phones, I don't care, my phone's made of g****** bamboo. That's awesome.When you ask for things to happen, they happen. This applies to general performance with touch interaction as well as voice, motion, etc. Without the task bar of a PC, I lose track of all the things running, but I've been shocked when I remember to check on this phone. It runs all of your favorite boring things like Facebook, your bank's app, 11 tabs of different lemon cake recipes, parts searches for a 1996 geo tracker, a 2003 Honda Element, and how to trim your micro SD card into a Nano SD card at the same time while playing music.Durability? As soon as I have the money after this purchase (yes, I'm broke. who else buys year-old phones off-contract to use on Consumer Cellular? yeah, the elderly. Are they writing long reviews on Amazon? No, they are not. Moving on). Anyway, as soon as I have the money, I'll be getting an Otterbox Defender case for this. I love the bamboo, and I ordered a somewhat protective case with a frosted transparent back for it at the same time as the phone, but I kill phones, and this one does not feed especially durable. Not that I expect it to. It's a big ol' ball of performance and fashion statement in a phone, and there's no room there for ""what if it falls of my pocket from a gaoddamn tractor?"".That's why I will, but haven't yet, dropped the cash on a good case.What else do you want to know? It's quick, it works, it's getting cheaper as the new version gets closer, but it's still a great phone and if you really want to pay retail prices you can still get it customized. Just think, you could have the very last custom 2014 version Motorola Moto X. Or you could, like me, get the best used one you can find and pretend it's exactly the way you want it. White front, bamboo back FTW.Anyway, it really is a good device.The last seven words of the last paragraph really should have been my review."
"I received the XT1092 model. This is completely unlocked phone. Needless to say how good the phone is as so many reviewers has already posted their comments. Motorola phones are always have value added features. Like Moto Assist. This phone has surpassed all other phones in features. Namely, Assist, Actions, Voice and Display.Interaction with this phone even when screen is off and cover closed and at a distance is beyond imagination of people who do not own this phone. Further, it comes with the best speech recognition and synthesis. Better than that found in Google Now and Microsoft's Cortana.I migrated from a Moto G 2014 to this phone. Safely to say Motorola is my only choice of phones and my household already have three of them. Go for it, highly recommended, a top quality phone with loaded features beyond the operating system which is Lollipop 5.1"
awful display. very poor image on this cell phone. The background is not clear at all.
The phone arrived in flawless condition. Appeared brand new!!! This is now officially the BEST phone I've ever owned and the cheapest I've ever paid for one. LOVE IT!!! Would definitely purchase from warehouse deals again.
"Let me preface this by saying that only 1.5 months ago, I really liked Motorola and loved my Moto X. Sadly, I cracked its screen, and even though I could fix it myself (I've done many phone repairs) I paid $130 to send it to Motorola for the original manufacturer parts and repair warranty. I figured I was paying for ease and convenience.I was so wrong.Almost two weeks passed without indication they had received my device. I called in a serious of support specialists before finally being forwarded to the escalation team, who took about 30 minutes to locate my phone, verify it had been received, and assue me that it would be sent back to me within 5 business days.But that wasn't the end.5 days later and no word from Motorola. I called again. Support informed me that, actually, they could not replace my Moto X. 'Replace' is the word they used. But wait - they are supposed to be repairing it, right? Wrong. Apparently they just send you a refurished edition of the same model. So they no longer had my original phone and could not even replace it with the same model.The representative offered me an 'upgrade' to the Nexus 6, which I absolutely HATE. It was way too big for me (I am a woman with small hands) and they are apparently completely unable to provide a Moto X Pure, which is the closest thing to what I have now. Somehow, it's not in stock? How is MOTOROLA, the company who MAKES the Moto X Pure supposed to be 'out of stock'?Anyway, they assured me the Nexus would ship in 5 business days. Here we are, 8 business days later, and STILL nothing. I called in at this point to demand a refund for all the inconvence, which I was informed they ""do not owe me"" because I agreed to receive a Nexus 6. Mind you, I agreed to a replacement for my LOST device - I did NOT agree that the replacement would be satisfactory compensation for all this grief and aggravation.This has been absolutely, by FAR, the worst customer service experience I have ever suffered through. On top of everything described, each representative could barely speak English, was dismissive and rude with me, and clearly barely trained, just reading off a script. I cannot express how enough how disappointed I am given how much I enjoyed the original product.At this point, I am only eager to receive my 'upgrade' to the Nexus 6 in order to promptly sell it, never buy anything Lenovo or Motorola again, and make it my life's mission to make sure everyone else knows how awful this company is, too.In sum, stay away from Motorola; while they make a decent product, should anything go wrong, God forbid, they will not support you and determine instead to make your life miserable."
Phone arrived in good condition. But when I tried to activate it with Verizon they said there was an issue with the IMEI number. The only thing I could do is return it.
"Love it. Mine arrived in an opened box, but otherwise looked untouched."
"Great. Battery life is only 4 stars, performance is good. Nice and light. OK camera. Great speakers"
i sent it back!!!!
OUTSTANDING!!! Top notch service and shipped on time. Great product. Would recommend.
I love it.
Good.
Great phone
"This is simply a great phone for the price. The only drawback to me is the lack of an SD card slot. The new Moto X phones do have the SD slot, all prior generations do not.This is a snappy and responsive phone. It has a decent antenna, and good battery life. I've gotten positive comments on the quality of photos its camera makes, too.Setting it up on my carrier was a snap. Just make sure that whatever phone you buy has the capability to work on your carrier's network, and you should be good to go!"
Ok!
Great phone . didnt realized it didnt have microsd expansión. My bad. But the 8 gb make it. I guess 3d generation will have microsd
I bought this for my sister. She like this phone
Everything was as i expected. Fully satisfied
"I love it! It is very useful, fast, and beautiful. I really recommend this!"
Excelent
Great cel!
I've just started setting up the phone. It is going good so far. The phone looks brand new. Very satisfied at this point
the best!
Great phone.Best price/quality relation I've yet seen.
Everything was perfect!
Excelence the whole buing process
NO SD card !!!!! that says it all for an Android phone.
Very good for the price paid.
So far--great phone!
Excellent product. I like it a lot.
"Overall, it is a really great phone, but has an inherent flaw in that signal reception is comparatively poor for the actual carrier network. One would assume that Motorola (famous for radios) would offer a superior product. I have a six year old Samsung that reliably receives calls and text messages where the Moto X does not. This issue has forced me to return this phone which, otherwise, is pretty fantastic."
"Good cellphone for the price. Just the camera is not as good as you expect from a modern phone, when it is a bit dark the camera just take bad pictures, and also it is difficult to focus. But I had already known it before buying, so this is not a problem."
Great!
Excellent phone
thank you
Awesome cellphone. Recieved all items. Very good Seller.
Good cel.
"This phone works well, it has features that other phones do not. For example, the google voice. I can give it commands and it will recognize my voice at a distance. I love the bamboo back and how stylish the phone is. The one issue I have with it is with sending videos. Other phones may allow you to select the length of the video before sending. This, however, makes you take the video through the messaging app."
Excellent! And it arrive before expexted.
"I am not the most high tech phone guy and I have a Samsung S5 for work, but I do love this phone. Everything works well on it. The battery seems to last a full day. The camera works well and the speed of apps is very good. I really have no complaints and like this phone very much."
It's good could be better
Very good phone. I'm really glad I bought it. It has a good camera and works great.
Best phone ever owned
Excellent delivery. Everything great
"I just love it! Its faster, comfortable and have a nice and unic design. It looks slick, with the now-trademark curved back panel."
"I don't normally start with the bad but I will this time.The Cons:The lower speaker grill broke off within the first week even with a cruzerlite case. That is really disappointing.Battery life is inconsistent. Some days are 4+ hours of screen time and other days I struggle to get 2 hours being in the same place with the same signal.The camera is just bad. Poor focus, fuzzy pictures and even worse low light performance. To use the 13MP advertised you must use 4:3 aspect ratio. 16:9 is 9.7MP.The Pros:Beautiful screen. Bright and crisp AMOLED that is just a joy to use.Stock Android with a few light touches that are welcome. The notification light up on the screen is great and doesn't require turning the whole screen on to see what is happening.The moto assistant is overall helpful but sometimes just doesn't listen haha.Conclusion:I wouldn't recommend this phone. Maybe the new 2015 moto X can deliver a better device. There are a lot better options out there that perform much better especially with the camera and battery life."
Very good phone
Perfect
Very high configuration for the price. Nice to have this phone
Like this cellphone!
Awezome!
"Good phone , accesible price."
"got phone today, NOT LOLLIPOP"
"The battery life on this phone, even under load, is pretty impressive when compared to my old Nexus 5. I'm definitely a convert. While Motorola's bundled software seems more gimmicky than a bunch of essential, killer apps, they definitely can be useful at times (Moto Connect is super useful -- I like having the ability to SMS from my laptop)."
"excelent product, just as described, and shipping fast"
"This guy is really weak, a very unfriendly cell phone for clumsy people or 'droppers'. Expect to crack that screen! The rest is just fine."
"Great Phone. Excellent features. Very bright indoors and OK bright outdoors. I love this phone. The music is pumped through only one speaker, but very loud. I can listen to music on my patio as I BBQ with no extra speakers. The phone is sharp too. The backing is leather finish and the rounded styling is beautiful. The voice command feature is super cool. I highly recommend this phone."
Disappoint Very Much
it's just what I expected
"great phone, size just what I was looking for.. Screen fantastic. Thin and light."
Thank you.
Awesome device! It has all you need in a phone!
Excellent
I have been looking forward to this phone since I knew my contract was going to be up soon.I got what I ordered! :)
"Great, but I bought it for latin america and seems AT&T has locked the function for the hotspot use on the cellphone. Is this even legal on an unblock cellphone??"
"I was sure it would be a great phone and with great looks. My expectations were high and they were exceeded!It is gorgeous and works extremely well.For my use the battery life is good, I get through the day easily.Coming from a Galaxy Nexus, I didn't opt for the Nexus 6 as it is too big for me, this was the next option. Almost pure Android, with the almost the same Nexus experience.Totally satisfied.Phone came is sealed box, pure version as promised."
"Operating system is impressive. The phone is fast, smooth, and performs as expected. The Moto features are also convenient (Drive, Sleep, Home features are useful and make accessing the phone a breeze). The camera seems fine to me, although I'm not someone who relies on my phone camera to provide professional quality images. The only thing that kept this review from being a 5 star is the battery life. It is not sub-standard by any means, but if with regular, moderate use throughout the day, a full charge will get you about 10 hours of use at most."
"I love this phone! It's fast, responsive, and adapts to your actions. The battery may seem a big issue for some people, but it lasts for at least 24 hours with my moderate usage.The biggest downside in my opinion is the storage capacity of 16 GB, which is actually a net of 10 GB only...and since there are no SD card slots, you will probably be running out of space while migrating your files from your old phone."
So good I'm buying another one
Its more than I expected!!!
Working great
Excellent My Grandson couldn't be happier.
This phone is super nice. It is a manageable size unlike many other flagships. Big-sized phones just take some getting used to. It's all the same in the end. The leather backing is not as thick or as nice as I thought it would be. Very nice phone.
All good !
"Amazing cell phone, my daughter like it so much."
"With the Canadian dollar tanking, it ended up costing more than expected...but still awesome phone. Replacing a Nexus4 and seems to excel in every way, especially for the price"
Very good device
Only cons is that it doesn't allow a memory card. But the cell phone is excellent
Nice Phone!! Thanks!!
Love the phone so far...have only had it for a week though.
"Great phone. No problems whatsoever. Camera could be better, but still works great in good lighting."
"""No Verizon SIM card"" message will not go away since this is an unlocked Verizon phone--this is something that the seller did not disclose! Buyer beware..."
"Excellent price, quality and delivery time!"
"It just works. It is fast and flawless. The screen is just the right size, not to big, not too small. Call quality is great. No complaints about this phone."
Very good phone. Seller also work great!
"Its an AT&T phone which has been unlocked so there will be lot of AT&T apps which cannot be uninstalled. You will be better off buying it off the Motorola Website, not only will you get 1 year warranty on the new phone you can also trade in your phone. The phone is great though, it is sleek, the screen size is perfect, the camera is awesome and the Hello Moto X command feature is very useful."
"This phone is just so great! I had a Moto G prior to this and I loved it and this was just the upgrade to continue my love of the Moto family. The apps are easy to navigate and I really like the assistant feature that figures out my life schedule and adapts based on my usage. The phone is intuitive to a casual or business lifestyle, which is great for me as I can flow in and out of official and personal business."
"It is new and working great. Sharp screen, good battery time."
One of the best buys on a phone!
Working perfectly! a really bargain for the price
A+++
"Great cel, delivery and information ."
"this is a Nexus, don't let the name fool you. Motorola made their bloody masterpieces in 2014: the Moto X and the Droid Turbo.The X14 is amazing.. just make sure you get the 32 gigabyte version.. the 16 comes with 10 useable gigs =("
"Fast delivery. Although used, the phone is absolutely indistinguishable from a brand-new one. I am very satisfied."
bought it for my mom. Her first smartphone. She loves it.
Excellent
Love this phone.
Great deal on Amazon and a great phone.
Having owned several Motorola products. More important. Having repaired them for 30 yrs. I feel they are the Harleys of the communications products available today. I broke the screen within 2 months because of my careless handling and a well directed fall. Repaired all for less than $30. Since then I have purchased 2 more for my kids. They are very pleased. Take note of the fragile screen comments. Providing a nice bumper frame case. You can take advantage of the numerous options available.
Description did not match unit. New screen but bad back and dinged corners and damaged moto x badge. Description read slight screen image but good back. Was able to replace bad parts with my good parts but still not as described. Also came with AT&T bloatware that I can't get rid of even as I thought I was getting a T-Mobile phone.
"Love it, love it!"
it's a great phone. this is my second one (i dropped the first one on a tile floor) and i liked it so well i bought one for my wife.
"Bought for Girlfriend after she broke her 5S. She likes it, very good phone. Beautiful screen. Complaints are: No home button, battery could be better, camera doesn't focus very well. Good for the price. Nice stop-gap phone. Will be good for a year or so. Definitely recommend if that's the situation for you."
"This is great fast phone,but have an issue with dinamics-people couldnt hear me while I am on speacker. Also,when I was using it to talk on a Skype-was really bad hearing. This phone has problem with speakers. All other functions are great."
"Great phone, ultra fast and pure android experience.Instant 5.1 upgrade"
i love everything about this phone. Except when i brought it to Verizon to have it activated they told me it was a locked phone! BOOOOOO!! Not what i ordered!Update: I've since received a new moto and its exactly what II ordered. Thank you amazon!
All right. No problems.
Excellent.
nice
"A exceptional phone, specially because it includes Android almost almost Stock"
All good. Met the expectations.
"works great. great condition, and fast shipping what more could you ask for!"
Great!
Good phone. But the screen cracked on the first fall. Probably weaker of the smartphones out there.
Best phone I had!
I love this phone!
"Pro:EVERYTHING (I had a nexus 5 and it was jut pain with signal and quality. My NEXUS 5 BENT)- Aluminum housing- Fast and Furious- Hanged only 1 time so far in 3 months (mutiple calls, fb, whatsapp, etc)- NEXUS 5 killerCons:- Whoever was the camera engineer should be fired. My 5 year old digi cam takes better quality pictures in DARK.- IN low light camera is like a day without a laugh (USELESS)"
"This phone has exceeded all of my expectations. The screen is wonderful, the battery long lasting. The stock Android experience is a wonderful thing. Want a great phone service experience? Get this phone and pick your own provider. I LOVE IT."
"Own a lg g4,htc m7 & m8,iPhone 5s and now a moto x second gen. Love my moto the best! Customized to me, sharp screen,fast,light,easy to set up from old phone. Buying my wife a moto g!"
"Very good phone, will recomend to anyone"
Is amazing!
Total happiness!
Good
Great value for the sale ($199 when I bought it) price. Can't be beat. Motorola's 2014 Flagship just a year old in November of 2015... for only $199? Kind of wish I grabbed a pair.
"Becomes a memory hog after few weeks of usage. The phone didn't come with a charger, even though it came directly from Amazon."
"Exceptional.I used the previous version of this and it was great.Now, this one had a problem and I sent it back for repair.I called the number in order to know what was wrong with it, andthey told me that they can't tell that. Sounds strange to me."
Great
Excellent phone. I love Motorola. The price was good.
👍
The OS used more memory than expected and if I did it again I would have bought the 32GB. Other than that it works awesome!
good phone especially when you get it at the right price. After using one for a while myself I bought this one for my mom. its pure android with no BS in the interface except the integral moto voice stuff which enables it to be awakened to answer a question . that function can work pretty well once set up right and trained to your command but there seem to be some conflicts with the 'ok google' function that is similar.Some little things like the twist to take a photo and the karate chop gesture to turn on the flashlight are cool.
"Pretty decent product with a reasonable price. Strong WiFi detection and stable WiFi connection all the time. It is however a little too big for my hand, but a bigger screen is always desired."
"Been using this phone for a few weeks now and is very user friendly, besides the internet browser. Not sure how to access previous tabs or open new ones, but will figure it out in time. I switched to the Moto X from a Samsung Galaxy S3 and is essentially the same thing minus the Samsung and mobile carrier clutter. Vibrant colors and fast. Get it!P.S. the wood back is definitely a conversation starter and a bragging point for a stylish phone."
Love it. Camera works really well and the display is sharp.
"Great phone until I dropped it. Fast, clean, decent price. No bloatware, unless you count some of the moto stuff like the hand motions and the moto version of Siri. Both of which I found useful, especially the shake for flashlight."
Heats too much . Everything else is Perfect
Excellent
"Camera has really hard time on focusing, in the night, it just doesn't work."
"I had a moto x before, and this one has a weird background image, with text, that I can't remove. On the picture attached, I put a white background so that you can see the text I'm talking about. This is definitely a bug. Please advise."
Very good mobile. Condition is very good as a new mobile.
"Great phone, but it was a gift and the receiver wanted to return it. Set up was easy with H20wireless, would have been a good phone."
"It is dead after 6 months, wtf happened, i dont know"
excellent was new !!!
"Logical system. Nice feel. Love Droid ops.Still waiting to test it outside USA.Said it was from T-MOBILE line of unlocked phones, but T-Mobile said they don't sell it. Regardless, it's working great."
Excellent phone at a great price.
I just love it!
My phone is not working properly and its not getting signal
The best price and quality
"Ordered through Open Group Wireless and they sent me a XT-1092 model, which doesn't match the description at all! The XT-1092 is the European / Chinese version which doesn't have the correct basebands to do T-Mobile LTE. Beware of buying through Open Group Wireless."
It worked as I was waiting
"Great smartphone. Quality build, nice features. So far so good"
Awesome product. Even better than iPhone.4K video recording is excellent.More friendly...could be ua best friend as mine.Go for it. The whole world will be on your finger tips.:-)
Great item!
Just loved it..Worth the price...
"Great phone. Comes with all the tools you would ever need and of course there are tons of apps to choose from. Large, sleek, fast and fun."
:)
"So I received the phone yesterday on a deal of the day special of $199 Amazon had this past week and thought ""Wow"" this is such a great deal until I realized it was only in 16gb. I thought really? They still make 16gb phones these days? Why? Well at least it has SD expansion and then realized it didn't. Once again, why not? If your only providing 16gb why not include SD expansion (makes no sense whatsoever).So I hesitated but thought well I can probably live with 16gb since I have cloud storage and a tablet with SD card so I pulled the trigger ($199 is had to pass up). I ordered the black leather edition and upon receiving it and holding it I was very pleased. It's beautiful to look at and hold and very well constructed as others have mentioned. The smell and feel of leather is unsurpassed by any other phone I have used prior (iPhones, Samsungs, LG's) the arched back design also allows for a superior hold in the hand.So all is well I thought, I'm loving it. I turned it on and immediately went to the storage capacity and I was blown away! Only 10.2 GB of available storage!!! What the hell how could this be? There must be some kind of mistake this is ridiculous! I was immediately prompted to update the software to Lollipop which I did and after updating all firmware and the outdated KitKat it came installed with and adding Whatsapp, CBS Sports and Slacker I was left with a repulsive 7.9 GB of available storage, I mean seriously this is a joke!How in the world does a 16gb device take up 6gb for the OS? Perhaps 2gb maybe 3 but 6? And if so why the hell isn't it advertised? Instead of 16gb it should be sold as ""10gb of usable storage"" I would have never purchased it...So yes the phone is pretty to look at and hold and yes the OS is stock android which craps on everything else but the usable storage of the Moto X is not reasonable and therefore I cannot recommend it especially if this is your go to phone and plan on having it for a while. With more apps, a few songs and constant app updates you will run out of storage in no time and your phone will begin to lag.If Moto is going to undercut the storage than at least provide an SD slot. Perhaps go for the 32gb or just get a Nexus. I mean really my LG Optimus G (E970) from 2012 is also 16gb, has a ton of AT&T and LG Bloatware and yet still has 11.8GB leftover of usable storage AND includes SD expansion and that's a 3 year old phone!!!"
New like out of the Factory!!
"This is one of the best smartphones you can buy under $300. I admit that this is not the latest Moto X, but for general purposes of general people, this phone is perfect. Its screen size is just perfect for one-handed use and media consumption, but the phone is not very big. The phone also feels substantial in hand, thanks to its very solid construction. The screen also offers very deep blacks and saturated colors. Only thing mediocre about this phone is the camera. That doesn't mean its got a bad camera, but the camera is just average in an otherwise awesome phone."
Great phone! Only reason why it is 3 stars is there is no expandable sd card slot (1 star) and you can't remove the battery (1 star)
👍
Probably the best smartphone out there. Love the bamboo in the back.. Super fast and really smooth. Colors are awesome and camera is great too..
Good quality phone easy to use.
"Great cellphone!, no problem with the shipping, all included as said! Recommended of course!"
I loved the near stock android experience
"Best phone ever - love the ""talk to me"" feature - I don't even need to touch my phone anymore, it's the best feature ever! I used to love the iPhone, but I'll never go back to an iPhone again - this phone has changed my life for the better."
EXCELLENT
Amazing phone .Total Value for MoneyWay to go Moto
"This is my second Moto. Excellent phone. Quick, Google now is great, very good HD video."
"Got this for my elder son after his Moto G died. It's a great value for the price, with a respectable camera, Lollypop, good battery life, and that gorgeous wooden backplate. Depending on the specs and reviews of the upcoming Nexus 5, I may replace my aging Nexus 5 with one of these."
excellent seller and product
Perfect
The phone it's ok but it's only show 10gb of space and not 16gb. And I mean all the space not the available.Any answer???
five star
"Perfect phone, that's what I expected!"
"Decent phone starting to show age, watch what you get though it was advertised as a unlocked phone but it's not I received the AT&T branded"
The phone wasn't unlocked and it didn't have a Sims card for it either
Very good all
"I am a late adopter. I am such a late adopter that I don't have a data plan but jump from wi-fi to wi-fi spot. I need a phone with solid hardware and simple tasks like listen to podcast. The phone battery needs to be charged daily. My ex BLU phone needed charging every 3 days. Most of the battery energy is consumed by Google Play services which I don't use often ( no data plan ) but oh well. Is my first OLED phone so I'm impressed with the graphics. The mechanics of this phone are pleasant ( weight, size, responsiveness )."
"For the price, it is still a very good phone (2016) .. But the absence of micro SD slot and FM radio can be a real turn down..If it had those, it would perfect for me."
This phone is SIIIICK!!!! Nice build awesome display quality loud audio through both of the speaker and through whatever headphones you decide to plug in great battery life Motorola never disappoints this phone came out two years ago and is still good compared to today's smartphone I'm using this phone along side an iPhone 7 plus and it runs just as smooth as the iPhone no hiccups or frame drops 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 Stalk android experience this is the pure edition so no crappy bloatware or unnecessary UI skins just perfect 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 And it is upgradable to 6.0 witch is the latest version Android N is on available for a small variety of phones
Excellent !!!
"Very good cell phone, althought it is very expensive replacement of your screen if broken"
"Don't buy this phone! I bought a Motorola Moto X 2nd generation phone for my college age son to take on a trip to South America. He's pretty careful with phones and is rather tech savvy.Throughout his trip, he contacted me regarding a number of issues he had: the phone kept overheating, poor battery life, poor connectivity (despite the fact that he had an international plan with data). The final nail in the coffin was about three weeks into his trip this phone crashed and upon rebooting the display was black and the phone ran very hot. Imagine trying to help someone troubleshoot something from 6000+ miles away and a 5 hour time difference. Try searching on google for ""Motorola moto x black screen"", there are hundreds of reports of this issue, with very few positive outcomes. The potentially tragic part of this was that my son took 700+ pictures before it failed. We finally gave up and upon his return we spent almost an entire day trying to troubleshoot this issue. Nothing we did changed this situation, all attempts to revive this phone failed. On a positive note, it did manage to connect to my home wifi network and all (we hope) his images did get uploaded to Google via the Photos app we downloaded prior to his departure. I tried everything on the Motorola troubleshooting web page and finally called their technical support line. I spent over an hour on the phone with people who obviously knew nothing about their product. Turns out this is a known issue, for which there is no resolution other than wiping the phone. They offered to repair/replace the phone. The insulting part was that they wanted to charge me a $25 fee for ""expedited replacement"", I opted for the standard free service. Here it is almost two weeks and still no word on when a replacement unit will be sent. I will never purchase another Motorola product as long as I live. Mind you, this is coming from someone who has owned numerous Motorola phones, including my current Motorola Droid Turbo. From now on I will take the advice of my friends and buy more reliable phones such as a Samsung Galaxy or a Google Nexus. Don't waste your money or your time on this device."
"Great phone. I bought it used/recondition. Have been using it about 3 weeks. So far it works great, no problems. It's white with a wood grain back. Looks nice. I bought the Leesentec screen protector. It's the best one I've ever used, easy to put on with no air bubbles. The phone has a 5.2 in. screen and a Quad Core 2.5 GHz processor. It's fastest phone I've ever owned. I only gave $135. I feel I got an excellent deal."
awesome
"It works great, Android is clearly not the best OS but the cellphone is good."
great phone
Everything ok!!!
"The phone itself is good. I bought a second hand one. Unfortunately, Moto X XT1097(my model, I got) has this OLED burnt screen. So, not too great. The seller did not mention it. So, if you do not want a bit burnt/shadowed oled screen mobile phone(used one), do not buy this model."
I need some help in order to use all its facilites.
My son is very happy with this phone.
great value and excellent phone
The phone works great! Almost new!!
"Excelent for the prive, good value"
"After about a month after my purchase. The phone is great. i would recommend it to ALMOST everyone. The only downside is that the camera is quite mediocre. The auto focus wont work at times, along with the cameras poor attempt to operate in low lighting. But if you arnt concerned with your phone camera. It is an amazing phone with many unique and useful features."
More than a better condition. Came clean and sweet. I don't mind the small space capacity but I love the phone.
Great phone
very doog
Excellent product. My son uses it all the time
"Fast, sturdy design."
"Great phone, great price."
This phone has been great. I was able to get it for $200 on a lightning deal. A much better deal than paying $600 for a Galaxy or an IPhone.
Good price
Great ítem! Like new
excelent
worst phone ever... bought one had to return right away as the keys were not working.. bought another one after 30 days the menu key doesn't work.. cannot return now or get it fixed.
"This phone replaced my broken nexus 5 and I couldn't be happier. Great package from Motorola. Screen is big enough for my liking and the phone is easy to handle with one hand. I have the black leather back and it feels very premium.In fact, the phone is so good that my wife and my dad ditched their iPhone and Samsungs for it. It just works. My phone is 2 years old and runs like brand new."
I about used to replace the one I had before. I love this phone so much I didn't want to switch it up.
The phone display stopped working in 6 months and I cannot use the phone.
"great phone, it has 2 things that sucks, battery life and camera"
perfect
Battery life and it's difficulty to connect with metro pcs are the biggest and probably only drawbacks to this phone. Works amazingly but will not last an average days use compared to other moto products.
Just received phone few hours ago but was very impressed that the phone was exactly as stated in sell information. Set up went smoothly and Moto X 2nd gen.is a great step up from Moto G. I couldn't be happier with purchase. Great valve.
Works perfectly. Not a single complaint.
"Great phone for the price. Very good screen resolution. Love the ability to look at messages, etc., without having to unlock phone first. Too bad it doesn't have memory card ability, but still a great phone."
"Outstanding product. Does everything I need. I couldn't see spending twice the price to get an apple product. No contract and unlocked is the only way to fly. Phone feels solid, not like a piece of plastic. Email and web browsing are a snap. Calendar is useful."
Its performance is not the best now but still works very well.
purchase a 2nd generation motorola supposedly very good and I arrived with damaged screen
"Great, got it for $139 from Amazon Whorehouse deals.It rocks as far as performance and quality. MUST BUY, if below $150... nothing better available for the price."
showed up at my doorstep as advertised. no problems yet after 2 months of usage.
i bought this during black friday and got it earlier than expected the phone was awsome but all of a sudden feb 1st the phone started to not charge properly i got a new charger and it seemed to act fine so i thought ok i just killed my last charger no big deal but not a few days later it started doing the same thing over and over borrowed a friends new charger and it wouldnt keep a connection to charge it unless i held it in just the right spot and now it will not charge at all it even a lil bit of a connection i looked and it looks like the port on the phone has slide inside and so theres no way to charge it and i cant even get it replaced went to send it back to get it fix or replaced or what ever and nope as of jan 31st i can no longer send it back so now even though its only been a few months im forced to buy a brand new phone this wasnt worth the money i spent on it
"Great phone! If you're looking for a great budget friendly phone, can't go wrong here! Great build quality and features. However once I updated to Android M, I lost some key features such as Motorola assist. :( boo!"
"I got a brand-new unoppend with the plastic on!i don't know about the screen a lot if it brakes easly or not but i don't want to find out, anyway i need to protect my phone... for me IT IS PERFECT!It was so good so I bought anthor one for my sister which came in a perfect condition!!!"
Very satisfied with the purchase. As good as its rivals which are 2X the price.
Awesome phone :-)
Excelente
everything it's OK
"Week two of my Moto X. Thankfully I was delivered the XT1095 model. This happened to be a big issue for me as I'm using it in South Africa and this page/seller had no real conclusive information that the XT1095 'Pure Edition' was available.To help any other foreign potential buyers out the XT1095 is truly a 'global phone'. I can't vouch for the Unlocked AT&T version but this XT1095 version works perfectly abroad. The only issue I'm experiencing is that it isn't picking up 4G on the CellC network however this may be due to a coverage issue and not missing band problem. Apart from that the HSDPA+ works perfectly with strong signal.The device itself is built great with the metal band and (in my case) bamboo back giving it an air of quality few can match at the price. Regarding the numerous reviews targeting the brittle screen which was a big concern of mine, I have no screen protector (I do have a case) and am pleased to report zero issues thus far with scratches or cracks. I look after it but don't feel I treat it any differently from my old phone. Its still early days with the phone but so far I am pleased with the durability of the gorgeous AMOLED screen.I haven't had a chance to truly test the camera but did notice the rather simple UI for the camera app. The few pictures I've taken were adequate in low light. However in well lit scenes it shines, matching higher priced rivals. The performance of the phone is smooth and without issue. It may not have the latest and greatest hardware but running the pure Andriod experience it moves swiftly. This in conjunction with the motion sensors that light up your display, showing notifications when reaching for your phone really made me look at phones differently. Features like this that are usually gimmicks on other brands end up being so useful with this Moto X that you really miss them when using a friends phone. It's not the hardware that defines the phone exclusively, it's how it all comes together and this Moto X (2nd Gen) has excelled in that regard.My only issue would be the battery life. Charges last a full day with wifi only pushing two. Hard usage drops this but the inclusion of a fast charger, which works great, is appreciated A bigger capacity battery would have truly taking this phone to another level. If you can go the route of a 32Gb model I suggest you do as a total usable space of 10.17GB isn't much. Add some music and a couple of apps/movies/pictures and that number depletes quickly.Overall for the price (trust me I researched every available option) this phone in my opinion is one of, if not the best you can get for $300. An easy phone to recommend."
"Great phone. I have moto x 1st generation and love it. Bought this one for my wife and she is happy with it. First charge held for 3 full days with very moderate use, and camera update fixed focusing issue. All the rest is great as it should be."
My husband cannot stop singing the praises of this phone.
"I upgraded from the Moto G. This phone has a lot of similar features since it is also a Motorola, but some of the new things I like are:- Wave your hand over the phone to see time/notifications- Quick glance of notifications without unlocking- Voice feature (Can ask questions, even when locked)- ""Talk to me"" feature - phone will read all notifications out loud for 30 mins. Perfect for when you're in the shower/doing dishes/etc.- Much better camera than the Moto G- Motion sensor actions (twist twice to open camera, karate chop down twice for flashlight)Overall, it just has some neat added features. It has been a tiny bit laggy at times, which is annoying (ex. going to Google search bar and the keyboard takes a few seconds to come up). But overall, I really like it."
"It's a really good cellphone but it doesn't support sd card, and the gallery doesn't offer to many options, for example you can't hide an album"
😀
The screen on this phone is *really* fragile.The performance and battery life are great - I've been quite satisfied by the phone other than this. But it's definitely not up to snuff on durability.I'm going to be replacing mine.
Amazing
"Fast phone. Few scratches because it was used but not noticeable. I have not tested the water proofing yet and don't think I will soon. Other phones look better on paper but I have used a Samsung s6 and this performs better. It doesn't have the lags. Camera is nice too and audio is very loud. Love it. Oh I bought it for my wife but I take every opportunity to ""update and configure it"" just so that I can use it"
"daily use, very powerful nice screen got it on prime deal of the day"
Great phone but it was a t-mobile version that came so sadly i had to return it. it says gsm unlocked but i could not use it with at&t.
"phone has little internal memory, and no way to add more. glass is right to edge of device making it very vulnerable to breaking when dropped. (Found this out the hard way.)"
Screen has an ad for the phone burned in it. Came with knockoff Apple earpods and charger even though the seller said it would come with factory earbuds. Nice phone otherwise.
Great phone. Love it. Best phone I've had so far and I've had something like 35 of them since I used to travel a lot and had to use different phones in other countries.
"Really nice phone overall, camera quality is not very good btw"
"Phone I received is XT1097 which I think is ATT and locked, can not upgrade beyond 5.1."
Phone works great and actually got an update to marshmallow. I particularly like the form factor as it is similar to the nexus 4/5 as opposed to the phablets we are seeing so much of these days.
"Love it but poor battery life. I'm not a heavy user but at the end of the day i've got less than 25%.Also, now (less than a year from new!) it won't charge from the wall outlet. Only directly from a computer or portable battery."
"This phone has everything you could possibly want in a cell phone and more. Fast processors, the Moto app that takes note of your driving and announces incoming calls and texts, allowing a truly hands free experience. I heartily recommend giving this phone serious consideration should you be looking for an unlocked device."
"Even in 2016, this is a great phone. I bought it for $199, making it an especially good deal. Internally, this phone packs a 2.5 GHz Snapdragon 801 processor. Applications open quickly, and there is no lag within the phone. The AMOLED screen produces vibrant colors, albeit a little over saturated. With the Adreno 330 GPU, gaming is smooth. The FHD display is more than adequate for the 5.2"" screen, and I believe that using a WQHD screen would be pointless. The visuals are crystal clear. The phone does not have stereo speakers despite its appearance, but the sound quality is still extremely loud and clear. The matte black finish is quite smooth, soft, and pleasant to hold.As a Motorola phone, this phone should receive quick updates to the newest version of android extremely quickly. Furthermore, the operating system is not full of bloatware that Samsung and LG install with the phone, but rather a few apps that allow for hands-free gestures and other shortcuts. These apps can be easily disabled at the users discretion, but I find them extremely useful.One thing that should be pointed out it that this phone DOES NOT have full support for T-Mobile's network. You will be able to text, call, and browse online, but the data speed and coverage will not be optimal."
"The blend of Bamboo with thin aluminium bezel and those ergonomically designed responsive buttons makes this device unique than anymore android device out there in the market. Upgraded to Android Marshmallow 6.0, nothing could be more satisfying than this. The rear Motorola dimple is much nicer to hold than other dimples in Moto lineup."
"Great smartphone overall! The screen is gorgeous, Motorola's software is extremely useful (My most used phrase these days must be ""OK Moto X""), and the otherwise Stock Android plus the powerful (even if aging) processor make for the fastest and smoothest Android experience I've ever had. The build and design is excellent, although I would recommend a case to protect that glass front, as many people allegedly broke their Moto X screen on the first drop. The camera is not perfect, but in good lighting conditions it can take excellent pictures. Fast Android updates are also a very good thing about the Moto X.So, overall, a great smartphone that offers a lot of value for its price."
"THE GOOD The Motorola Moto X has a sharp 1080p screen, a swift quad-core processor, nifty software and gesture features, and customizable design options that'll fit anyone's style.THE BAD A minimalist camera, combined with no expandable memory, are the handset's only drawbacks.THE BOTTOM LINE The Motorola Moto X hits all the right notes, delivering stock Android inside a powerful high-end handset that you can customize yourself."
"This was one of the top smartphones in 2014, but newer models have been released since then. Performance is still more than adequate for most people. This unlocked version did receive the Android 6.0 (marshmallow) upgrade. We got the upgrade over-the-air in January 2016. Reportedly, locked version of this phone will not be getting the upgrade. If you're looking for a cheaper unlocked Android phone and can live with the paltry 16GB of memory, this is a great choice. Price was $200 when I bought it here. 16GB may be fine if you mostly use the cloud to store music, video, and photos. If you're a hoarder, look for a 64GB phone instead."
"This is a good phone, but know its limitations and your usages. I know at this point I am speaking to people looking for a slightly ""old,"" < $200 phone. You could do worse than the Moto X. This is optimized for phone use; this 16gb item is not a proxy tablet or a hand-held entertainment center. The ""feel"" is high-end in the phone's weight/balance, materials, and rigidity. The software is nice. As many reviews point out, this is basically a no-BS, stock, android with a very few and almost always clever and useful accessories (like a minimalist, motion sensitive lockscreen; a twist-to-activate camera; and Motorola-tweak for using OK Google to operate the phone, make calls, etc.). It has one front-facing speaker, which I think is smart. It has the best speaker-sound I have ever heard in a phone; great for speaker-phone use. (Oddly, the conventional receiver speaker may be below average, or just not volume-optimized; it is weak at max volume, even). The phone's drawbacks are a) it has no SD card, and Marshmallow [the OS] takes up 6gb of the hard drive. This means that if you have a few apps on the phone that are sizable, you will likely store photos or music on a cloud or micro SD stick. That doesn't sound onerous, but it could be, and most apps will not read directly, except in very limited ways, from an accessory card or cloud. You would need to move files onto the native drive, and then move them back to conserve space, etc. and: b) The camera is fine in broad daylight--but only in broad, blazing daylight or super-close flashes of still-life circumstances. People are not nit-pickling when they criticize this camera. Under the best of circumstances, it composes images of Georges Seurat-like impressionist blobs. Indoor photography is hit-or-miss, and usually a miss; the Moto X camera struggles to focus or attain light balance and surprisingly the camera takes almost no advantages of flash (?!) to correct its low-light, indoor difficulties; one indoor shot out of four will look ""pretty good"" but I can do nothing to control this outcome. But if you only take close-up flash shots or outside sunshine shots, it is still functional and acceptable. I tried using other camera software, and the original equipment software seems best. The Moto locks down ISO and exposure time settings, in any case, so that no software can control those features (my old LG-G2, which sadly developed crazy-screen syndrome, allowed these adjustments from the start). I like the saturated colors on the screen--on a bigger screen (tablet or bigger), I likely wouldn't, but this painterly, color-popping screen is an audacious detail to put on the phone. I think it's cool, but one dubious benefit of the saturated screen is that it makes the camera's sketchy work seem much better than it will on a large, normally saturated and balanced screen. Bottom line: great feeling, great looking, minimalist phone; reasonably fast processor. Don't get the 16gb model if you have many music or image files to store: no SD card. The camera is weak."
Excellent device. Worth the money.
"I did not receive the charger, charger cable, or the sim removal tool along with my phone. The package says it should also include those items. Hopefully I already have the sim card in my phone."
"BEST PHONE I`VE EVER OWNED!The Moto X was a great flagship smartphone in it`s launch date back in 2014, the price at that time was OK, but now with this price cut value is really amazing. When you think about not only the specs but also the software and quality this smartphone has to offer theres no much really any major brand smartphone that catches up to this level.Main pros:PerformanceSpecificationsDesignQualityMoto functionsAmoled 5.2 inch displayCons:Battery doesn`t suck but is not the best in it`s segment. It could offer a bigger a bigger battery considering the thickness of the smartphone.Camera:13 Megapixels seem good but the performance in low lighting aren't satisfying."
"Using phone for a month in extreme conditions, dropped on concrete once with bumper, no problems. Software runs smooth and very intuitive."
"Its been just 3hrs since i used it and this is my first impression.Light UI n Much faster- Switching from Samsung S6 to this made me feel much better. S6 has too much bloatware and without many new apps installed, its RAM Is already 86% used and it gets slow with its touchwiz UI. But Moto X is clean, has little bloatware but not too bad. Still has 1GB+ RAM available.Too good for what i paid for - $299 for this phone?? Its bargain... i feel like i bought Nexus 6 or S6 for $299 and for $65 u cud get the Moto extended warranty too!!! Excellent isn't it?"
"great phone, battery backup is also good."
Great phone. Set-up was easy and fun.It has all of the bells and whistles that a flagship phone should have. The price was reasonable and I got a first rate phone.
"You can pretty much get a feel for this phone from reading the specs. Mine is black with the plastic back which is still kind of grippy. Aesthetically, the phone is sexy. It feels really good to hold and look at. That said, for my taste it feels wider than it is long. Obviously it's not, but it's wider than I'd like it to be, minor thing I guess. The camera's good, not great but definitely not as bad as some reviews make it seem. Obviously it doesn't perform as well in low light, which the iPhone is really the only one that does. But you won't be disappointed with this phone, the few things Motorola adds to the software are actually useful. Battery is okay, I'd say average and could definitely be better. But you should make it through the day."
Would be nice if Amazon sold the 64GB version too.
"Motorola has figured out the right combination of standard and delightful. Standard in that this is a 99% pure Android phone. Delightful in that there are little Moto surprises that don't get in the way of the Android experience. For example, Spotlight Stories sounds kinda cheesy, but it's cute and fun, so well done.The Moto X (2nd gen) is just the right size. Big enough for photos and videos and Chromecast, small enough to fit in phone pockets popular in men's shorts these days. The screen is amazing. Everything is so responsive. I'm sure this will be perfect for me for a couple of years. Amazing that I could get it off-contract for $300.I put an ArmorSuit MilitaryShield on the screen, and a teal Cruzerlite Bugdroid gel case around the back. I really could not be happier!"
good a pure android phone
"Shipped very fast, great phone"
Turning off the moto features will keep the phone cool otherwise it burns like hell.
The leather back gets full scratches.It says it has 16 gig but it only has 10 gig. False advertising!!
Fantastic!
"I had the first generation Moto X for two years. Used to love it, the size, the speed, the practicality of a compact phone with decent performance. I decided to go with the second gen, amidst the launch of the third generation due to the size, specs, and price. So far I've been impressed. I'll admit that I'm still getting used to the larger screen, but this phone sure is fast. The bear stock Android experience is a welcome addition, and the small enhancements Motorola added to it are more than welcomed. If you're looking for a great phone and a low cost and want it to simply work, get this one. The camera is ho-hum, I've seen better. But for my needs, its more than adequate."
"The best mid-range Android phone in my opinion.Pros:- Nice screen. Bright, vivid, responsive.- Good quality body- Nice camera- Fast charging battery- Sound quality is good- Very clean Android (nearly default experience)- An extra chip just to track movement and respond.Cons:- Only one: Default launcher is not good. But you can install from tons of choices from Google Play. I prefer KK Launcher."
"Best phone I had so far. Moved to it from a OnePlus One, which was good, but a little too big."
Excellent phone and was delivered on time.
"Great device, best value in a full HD phone."
The best smarphone I've ever owned.
"It's a Motorola, what more needs to be said?"
"I get a moto phone g2 generation, it was not it purchases"
"One of the best smartphones you can buy for it's price, really love what Motorola has done with this phone."
"This is my forth smart phone, started with a Motorola Spice Key (keyboard <3), then went to some second hand LG, then Moto G 2014. This is the first one that I feel alleviates my need for a paper notebook. This and the Spice Key are the two I feel comfortable calling a tool.Note on usage: I use this and the previous phones listed more as a small tablet (Spice Key as a PDA) than a phone and I've always had another device I use as a phone."
very good
The phone case causes the microphone to reverberate. Almost everyone I call complains about the echo. If I remove the case no problems. This is a serious defect and should be fixed.
Hate this phone. Had a busted up Samsung Note 2 and there is a huge difference... My old beat up Samsung was superior! You cannot block calls or texts using this Moto X device. I downloaded several apps just to try to block numbers and texts on this phone with no luck. Spend the extra money to buy a better phone. The only good thing about this phone is size and the price (but you get what you pay for with bad quality and horrible camera).
Love it. I have a moto G and got this for my mom. It's bigger and better. Only downside is that the power button is super sensitive so it keeps turning on in her pocket.
"Great performance, but battery life could be better. Also where is marshmallow?"
excelent phone! great quality
"This phone is fantastic! For those looking for a flag ship phone on a budget, this is your device!"
"I like the software and the look, it ran perfectly. But the screen cracks very easily and a replacement for these guys is $300. Upon replacement, the proximity sensor stopped working which meant as soon as I made a call, the screen went black and I couldn't end the call (I would leave 10 minute long messages unless I manually turned the phone off).I've had this phone for about 3 or 4 months now and the screen has just started going haywire as well. The image content cycles across the screen like it's on a conveyor belt. I've spent $600 on this phone so far and I've been having chronic problems. For me, I regret making the purchase..."
"Everything was perfect, I got the white/Bamboo combo and it is completly unlock device XT1095, sold and shipped by Amazon.This is the best phone you can get right now a completely unlock device go ahead and give it a try!!"
"I think this is a decent phone. I came from Nexus 5 so I can compare both phones. To me, there isn't much difference. Both phones function the same. I don't notice Moto's bigger screen but lower ppi screen. Both screens look good. I do think the Moto has more contrast though.I am not a fan of where the volume buttons and the power buttons on located. They are on the same side. I think they should be on opposite sides. Or they should've been farther apart. I always hit the power button when I'm trying to increase the volume and vice versa. This is one of my least favorite things about this phone.The little indentation on the back is worthless. I don't understand it. Some people like to rest their finger on it. It doesn't work for me. It's uncomfortable.The camera seems same as Nexus 5's. The ring flash is a nice gimmick. But with a flash that small, there isn't much difference. If they wanted to make a ring flash, the flash should circle the entire phone. Then it can give the distinctive, ring-flash look.I'm not a big fan of the speakers either. They feel like buttons, and I always want to push them. They're rough too.Despite by nit-picks, this is still a great phone. It will serve many people's purpose well for a smart phone."
"I bought this phone late in the game, not long before this year's (2015) iteration will launch, so will skip the overview of all the specs and how it stacks up against its competitors and all that ""I wish I was a tech journalist"" nonsense.I wasn't shopping this phone against its competitors, but its predecessor, the original 2013 release of the Moto X, and several other phones in the $200ish range. I bought it at 229 USD, just 30 more than I could have bought its predecessor as new old stock, but lightly used.It has impressed me so far. I've used a few android devices, including a smartphone (Motorola Droid Razr Maxx 'can we add any more names to this thing?') that I used without a SIM, essentially as a miniature tablet for wifi use with a Motorola Tundra as my talk/text device until the Tundra finally died.So, since it's about to be outdated, why don't we look at this phone in detail, but without the ""brand new shiny thing"" glasses of release day, and from the perspective of someone who has used, but not relied upon, smartphones for some time.First, it looks good. In my case, with a white front and bamboo back, I like it, even if I'm not a fan of white on phones, I don't care, my phone's made of g****** bamboo. That's awesome.When you ask for things to happen, they happen. This applies to general performance with touch interaction as well as voice, motion, etc. Without the task bar of a PC, I lose track of all the things running, but I've been shocked when I remember to check on this phone. It runs all of your favorite boring things like Facebook, your bank's app, 11 tabs of different lemon cake recipes, parts searches for a 1996 geo tracker, a 2003 Honda Element, and how to trim your micro SD card into a Nano SD card at the same time while playing music.Durability? As soon as I have the money after this purchase (yes, I'm broke. who else buys year-old phones off-contract to use on Consumer Cellular? yeah, the elderly. Are they writing long reviews on Amazon? No, they are not. Moving on). Anyway, as soon as I have the money, I'll be getting an Otterbox Defender case for this. I love the bamboo, and I ordered a somewhat protective case with a frosted transparent back for it at the same time as the phone, but I kill phones, and this one does not feed especially durable. Not that I expect it to. It's a big ol' ball of performance and fashion statement in a phone, and there's no room there for ""what if it falls of my pocket from a gaoddamn tractor?"".That's why I will, but haven't yet, dropped the cash on a good case.What else do you want to know? It's quick, it works, it's getting cheaper as the new version gets closer, but it's still a great phone and if you really want to pay retail prices you can still get it customized. Just think, you could have the very last custom 2014 version Motorola Moto X. Or you could, like me, get the best used one you can find and pretend it's exactly the way you want it. White front, bamboo back FTW.Anyway, it really is a good device.The last seven words of the last paragraph really should have been my review."
"I received the XT1092 model. This is completely unlocked phone. Needless to say how good the phone is as so many reviewers has already posted their comments. Motorola phones are always have value added features. Like Moto Assist. This phone has surpassed all other phones in features. Namely, Assist, Actions, Voice and Display.Interaction with this phone even when screen is off and cover closed and at a distance is beyond imagination of people who do not own this phone. Further, it comes with the best speech recognition and synthesis. Better than that found in Google Now and Microsoft's Cortana.I migrated from a Moto G 2014 to this phone. Safely to say Motorola is my only choice of phones and my household already have three of them. Go for it, highly recommended, a top quality phone with loaded features beyond the operating system which is Lollipop 5.1"
awful display. very poor image on this cell phone. The background is not clear at all.
Amazing phone.
Excellent product
Great phone at a Great price. It was a Verizon phone originally tho not Att as the ad specified. The seller offered a refund tho so buy with confidence.
"my first moto x, everything works well so far except for the camera, it is incredibly difficult to have the camera come into focus, i have to move it close, away, close, away, to try and have the focus come out clear. the pictures are fine once i can get the camera in focus."
"This phone has the worst sreen i ever had. Don t buy it, it s too fragile.Now i have to replace it and cost, half the phone."
"I think i wasnt luck this time...i bought two of theese...one of them get brickes after two days and four software upgrades... Had to return it...the other one is perfect...great size, great speed and featured... Im using it in argentina without any kind of problem."
Excellent phone. Very good cost benefit. Higly recomended.
Perfect
"So I gave it a few weeks and at this point I must say I am very pleased with my Moto X 2nd Gen. It is very quick and smooth, take pictures well and calls are crystal clear. It has "" learned "" my voice and responds as well as any iPhone I have seen.It fits my hand and pocket well, screen is large enough for me ( I wouldn't want it much larger if at all ). I still have much to learn in the Android platform but as for the phone itself, I have no complaints. I was worried about battery life but thus far it has been very good for my use ( not a ultra heavy user tho ) and lasts me all day and well into the next."
I love this phone. Absolutely could not beat the price when I got it. I have had this phone for a just over a month now and here are my pros/cons.Pros:Great quality buildHigh Screen-to-Body %The AMOLED screen is crisp and so black that sometimes I can't discern the screen from the front fascia border.Moto Assist. I am now spoiled by the motion activated screen for checking notifications.Cons:Battery life is not very good. I just had to increase my charging frequency. Drains especially fast during continuous use.Moto Assist. The screen basically turns on whenever something passes over it not just a hand.
Awesome phone for the price! Love it! Great for everyday tasks and use. Long battery life.
Great phone
"its simply incredible, by far, the best phone i ever had in my life"
All was perfect!
"Excellent! Absolutely new XT1095, very beautiful with bamboo back cover. Powerful, with last Android version."
"Thank you for my smartphone . I am very glad that everything worked very well . Thank you for your prompt delivery and excellent , high-quality goods!"
Well. You told me. I didn't listen. Two days. One feet high... Broken Glass.
"I love the Moto X second Gen for its speedy performance due to it's snapdragon 801, and its amazing display due to its amoled 1080p hd. However no device is perfect and neither is this one, as it lacks a powerful battery, or an amazing camera, but it works and that is not why I gave this product four stars. I gave it four stars due to my products lack of build quality. It was strong but the bamboo was weak and coming off from the bottom. My phone still scratches very easily when putting it in my pocket, I found out it was sand and.... I work in a geotech company.... Besides those two flaws, I love my new phone..."
"Love this phone. Graduated from the Moto G and preciously and iPhone 5 and previously iPhone 4 and 3G. Best phone I've used out of those. Not the highest end specs but phone has a ton of nice but non-overwhelming features. Only minor complant is the Moto Voice doesn't always pick up my voice, but at the bar last night kept cutting on when I never said anything close to my keywords, I've turned that off and went with standard Google now 'OK Google'. 100% RECOMMEND."
Awesome!
"Why is xt1097, instead xt1095"
"excellent seller, arrived quickly and as described, satisfied with my cell"
Great cellphone. Great price. Delivery occurred in 2 days (with Amazon Prime).
I was looking for a replacement for my broken Gen 1 Moto X (which I loved). If this phone were slightly smaller it would be perfect.
Very good cell phone!
Overall it's a pretty decent case. My only complaint is that it is loose around the power button and volume rocker. Besides that it's comfortable to hold and has a good looking design
"Perfect phone. Switched over to Sprint for the iPhone 4 Ever plan, so had to return it."
"Fast, good battery life, decent camera. Amazon deal of the day at $199."
"The phone is sleek, lightweight and user friendly and the performance is great. But it looks like its a used/returned item. have few dents on the leather, and the protective screen is not intact (Its advertised as brand new though)."
"The phone's performance is what was expected. But beware of Amazon, this phone looked like it was a returned. The back plate had some dents to it and the plastic screen cover had dust bubbles. Obviously it was taken out of the box. When you buy something labeled as Brand New it ought to be Brand New!"
"I am coming from aa note 3 to this and it amazes me how different everything is. I have had a moto g 2014, blu vivo air, iPhone 5s, note3, s2,3,4,5, lg g flex, and the list goes on and on.... Out of all the phones I have had this one is the bestProsFast! (As fast as dropping a stick of butter!)Solid buildAwesome call qualityGood signal strengthFast charge!!!!!Ambient screen!Latest updates!ConsNo upgradeable sd card slot :'-("
for a little while a couple weeks after I first started using it the auto rotate didn't work. I went online and saw it is not uncommon problem. Solution is to whack phone hard against your thigh.Battery life doesn't seem too great.Otherwise it is OK phone
"Beautiful bamboo back, decent battery life, a bit on the larger side compared to Moto X 2013, great Android experience that is close to vanilla."
Excelent!!
Amazing phone.
"This phone is a piece of crap, I have purchased 2 hoping that the broken headphone jack was just luck, but the jack broke on my second phone immediately after the return warranty was up. If you want to use headphones with this phone EVER. Do not consider buying."
I love it! Everything about this phone is great! Highly recommend if you want a good reliable phone that feels premium and performs great.
ok
Great
One of the biggest mistakes I did is to buy this phone on Amazon. Till date since buying the phone in early July I have not been able to place more than 5% of my calls and still have not received a single call on this phone. All the calls drop each and every time. And when i do receive a call not able to pick it up. The dialler functionality to receive calls is horrible. I tried calling motorolla for help regarding this issue and I was told to do a hard reset on the device which I did but the problem still persists.Shame on Motorolla and Amazon to sell such horrible devices.
"I love it! It is very useful, fast, beautiful and soon it'll get marshmallow. I really recommend this!."
Excelent!!
Perfect! And arrived sooner than expected!
"I found out when i went to get this phone fixed that I was sold a pre used phone. I fully thought I was paying for a new unused phone. anyways the phone didn't last a week, the screen will not turn on and I'm told it's 200 dollars plus to replace. might as well just buy a new phone."
Everything was fine!
"Great phone. pure andriod, love their apps. it figures out that you're driving and would tell you when someone is calling or sending you a text.battery lasts a day most of the time."
Its an Excellent phone The programms of like AT&T and T-Mobil sometimes are annoying
The phone is great. The connection to the ATT network can be problematic at times even when there are cell towers close by.Bought two phones. One updated to Lollipop 5.1 while the other is still using 5.0. Not sure why the delay in updating the Android software in the other phone. Overall very nice phone that could someday earn five stars if service connection problems are addressed.
Make sure you do NOT buy from Open Group Wireless! Even though the model is shown as XT1095 I received an XT1092 which will NOT work properly (above 2G) on US GMS networks!I made the mistake of only looking at reviews after purchasing from them. Others have reported the same problem!
Excellent!!!!
ok
"This was my 2nd attempt to purchase the Moto X on Amazon... this was very successful and activated quite nicely. I would highly recommend this phone, but make sure you get an XT1095 or 1097 model. the XT1092 would not connect to the US AT&T network, even after 2 hours of working with the AT&T rep and manager and the tech support line. Even though this phone does not have a microsd card, it does connect up nicely to a micro USB drive... I would recommend it if you are in a marginal reception area for the 4G LTE services."
"Great phone... I thought it works in 4g antennas in LatAm but it doesn't.reagarding performance, it is the greater the quicker as expected. Very good phone."
Love this phone had one just like it and I accidentally sat on it so I bought a new one just like it love the bamboo cover wish the screen was larger but the phone is great
"So far so good. I like it. The only thing that caused a little problem is I had to order a ""nano"" SIM card. I was not able to simply take my old SIM card out and insert it in the new phone. I will try and update several months from now..."
The product was everything that I expected from the description. The phone works great and very pleased with the speed of delivery.
"excellent phone, very good price and quality. Four good"
very true to description. Got to say I am pleased so far.
"This phone breaks easily. There's a reason they stopped selling it. Not to mention the description didn't say that ""unlocked"" does NOT mean ""Verizon compatible"". I wasted my money on a rubbish phone that I couldn't use."
Received it quickly works as well as the phone it replaced.
"I previously owned a brand new MotoX 1st Generation which I had a love/hate relationship with. I hated the fact it would not hold a charge so it was spending more time on the charger than your average phone. Then one day the chip fell out the charging port so within a year I needed another phone. Since new was not that great I decided I would go for a used MotoX & purchased this one. I love this phone. Its bigger than the 1st Generation, it holds a charge & is totally compatible with AT&T. All I had to do was switch over the SIMS from the old phone to the new phone. It was a simple process with a convenient little tool that was included & was easy to do. Never had to contact the service provider. I love easy...Any phone I have ever ordered on Amazon , no matter who the seller was, had been received quickly & was exactly as it had been described."
"I am so disappointed. It has been less than six months and this phone has completely stopped functioning. It gets super hot when charged, loses its battery within an hour, and no longer charges 90% of the time.This is the first negative review I have ever written. I am BEYOND disappointed."
Phone was advertised as unlocked but came locked to Verizon. Had to call and get that taken care of before it could be used.
"Everything from the packaging to the phone was just amazing. I got it when it said that it was going to be back in stock at a later sate bbut then the shipping was bumped up to the same week so don't be afraid of the in stock later date.The phone is amazing. Depending on your internet speed, it will take a while for the four updates to take places; it goes from Kitkat, to the latest Lollipop and Marshmallow is expected soon.Apart from that, everything is great from the screen (super bright and vibrant) to the performance (which is impeccable for the price - I got 44000 on Antutu after downloading some apps. It got 30 - 50 FPS in the game region which is great. The phone is just really fast and can compete with the big flagship phones) to the gameplay (which is very fluid with no lag issues on arcade games, haven't tried frame intensive games) to the camera (absolutely amazing especially in apps like Instagram and Snapchat) to the microphones (I could talk to it from a good few feet away in the ideal conditions). The only thing is no SD card slot but everything else is great. Not to mention the cool Moto features and NFC support.3 days updateThe phone is still holding beautifully.It better than ever with around 5GB left in storage (after downloading a lot of games and social media apps). Just monitor your storage so you don't use it up all at once. But as it is, the phone is functioning beautifully and it working like a charm.It still doesn't lag and functions beautifully and the more graphic intensive games like FIFA 15 and easily handles games like Crossy Road with ease. Day to day tasks are even smoother with no stuttering, just fluid actions from opening apps to using them for long periods of time to jumping from one to another; the RAM is holding up spectacularly.I would highly recommend getting a quick charger with it so you can keep it charged. You'll need it if you use your phone alot.All the Moto Actions still work and as time passes, the phone gets to know you better so it appears to work better over time (just make sure all the apps are up to date).Just a really great phone overall. If I had a Micro SD card slot, there'd be nothing stopping it but it does support USB OTG (so to some measure, the phone is perfect)."
works fine............ I don't find GPS
"I bought it for my daughter. She loves the clear display and the OS. She wishes that it supported additional SD memory card. That was her only complaint. The size is good (not too big, not too small). She loves the bamboo feels. Samsung and Apple get most of the media attention when it comes to smartphones, but if you are looking for decent functionality and great value, check out Motorola phones. If someone from Motorola sees this, I should get some compensation (maybe another free phone?) for a positive review, call me ;-)"
Just got my brand new moto x. It's so quick so don't have to wait till my favorite apps open.
"Overall, a nice phone except the extremely yellow screen."
One of the best phone in 2014 and still serve me good. Love everything about this phone except for no micro sd slot and limited internal memory (I got the 16GB model).
Great
Excellent
Great phone
Excellent phone and was delivered on time.
"Great device, best value in a full HD phone."
Excellent delivery. Everything great
"I just love it! Its faster, comfortable and have a nice and unic design. It looks slick, with the now-trademark curved back panel."
"I don't normally start with the bad but I will this time.The Cons:The lower speaker grill broke off within the first week even with a cruzerlite case. That is really disappointing.Battery life is inconsistent. Some days are 4+ hours of screen time and other days I struggle to get 2 hours being in the same place with the same signal.The camera is just bad. Poor focus, fuzzy pictures and even worse low light performance. To use the 13MP advertised you must use 4:3 aspect ratio. 16:9 is 9.7MP.The Pros:Beautiful screen. Bright and crisp AMOLED that is just a joy to use.Stock Android with a few light touches that are welcome. The notification light up on the screen is great and doesn't require turning the whole screen on to see what is happening.The moto assistant is overall helpful but sometimes just doesn't listen haha.Conclusion:I wouldn't recommend this phone. Maybe the new 2015 moto X can deliver a better device. There are a lot better options out there that perform much better especially with the camera and battery life."
Very good phone
Perfect
Very high configuration for the price. Nice to have this phone
Like this cellphone!
Awezome!
I've just started setting up the phone. It is going good so far. The phone looks brand new. Very satisfied at this point
the best!
All good !
"Amazing cell phone, my daughter like it so much."
"With the Canadian dollar tanking, it ended up costing more than expected...but still awesome phone. Replacing a Nexus4 and seems to excel in every way, especially for the price"
Very good device
Only cons is that it doesn't allow a memory card. But the cell phone is excellent
Nice Phone!! Thanks!!
Love the phone so far...have only had it for a week though.
"Great phone. No problems whatsoever. Camera could be better, but still works great in good lighting."
Good.
Great phone
Just received phone few hours ago but was very impressed that the phone was exactly as stated in sell information. Set up went smoothly and Moto X 2nd gen.is a great step up from Moto G. I couldn't be happier with purchase. Great valve.
Works perfectly. Not a single complaint.
"Great phone for the price. Very good screen resolution. Love the ability to look at messages, etc., without having to unlock phone first. Too bad it doesn't have memory card ability, but still a great phone."
"Outstanding product. Does everything I need. I couldn't see spending twice the price to get an apple product. No contract and unlocked is the only way to fly. Phone feels solid, not like a piece of plastic. Email and web browsing are a snap. Calendar is useful."
Its performance is not the best now but still works very well.
purchase a 2nd generation motorola supposedly very good and I arrived with damaged screen
"Great, got it for $139 from Amazon Whorehouse deals.It rocks as far as performance and quality. MUST BUY, if below $150... nothing better available for the price."
showed up at my doorstep as advertised. no problems yet after 2 months of usage.
"Good cellphone for the price. Just the camera is not as good as you expect from a modern phone, when it is a bit dark the camera just take bad pictures, and also it is difficult to focus. But I had already known it before buying, so this is not a problem."
Great!
Excellent device. Worth the money.
"I did not receive the charger, charger cable, or the sim removal tool along with my phone. The package says it should also include those items. Hopefully I already have the sim card in my phone."
"BEST PHONE I`VE EVER OWNED!The Moto X was a great flagship smartphone in it`s launch date back in 2014, the price at that time was OK, but now with this price cut value is really amazing.

"Using phone for a month in extreme conditions, dropped on concrete once with bumper, no problems. Software runs smooth and very intuitive."
"Its been just 3hrs since i used it and this is my first impression.Light UI n Much faster- Switching from Samsung S6 to this made me feel much better. S6 has too much bloatware and without many new apps installed, its RAM Is already 86% used and it gets slow with its touchwiz UI. But Moto X is clean, has little bloatware but not too bad. Still has 1GB+ RAM available.Too good for what i paid for - $299 for this phone?? Its bargain... i feel like i bought Nexus 6 or S6 for $299 and for $65 u cud get the Moto extended warranty too!!! Excellent isn't it?"
"great phone, battery backup is also good."
Great phone. Set-up was easy and fun.It has all of the bells and whistles that a flagship phone should have. The price was reasonable and I got a first rate phone.
"You can pretty much get a feel for this phone from reading the specs. Mine is black with the plastic back which is still kind of grippy. Aesthetically, the phone is sexy. It feels really good to hold and look at. That said, for my taste it feels wider than it is long. Obviously it's not, but it's wider than I'd like it to be, minor thing I guess. The camera's good, not great but definitely not as bad as some reviews make it seem. Obviously it doesn't perform as well in low light, which the iPhone is really the only one that does. But you won't be disappointed with this phone, the few things Motorola adds to the software are actually useful. Battery is okay, I'd say average and could definitely be better. But you should make it through the day."
Excellent My Grandson couldn't be happier.
This phone is super nice. It is a manageable size unlike many other flagships. Big-sized phones just take some getting used to. It's all the same in the end. The leather backing is not as thick or as nice as I thought it would be. Very nice phone.
"The battery life on this phone, even under load, is pretty impressive when compared to my old Nexus 5. I'm definitely a convert. While Motorola's bundled software seems more gimmicky than a bunch of essential, killer apps, they definitely can be useful at times (Moto Connect is super useful -- I like having the ability to SMS from my laptop)."
"excelent product, just as described, and shipping fast"
"This guy is really weak, a very unfriendly cell phone for clumsy people or 'droppers'. Expect to crack that screen! The rest is just fine."
"Great Phone. Excellent features. Very bright indoors and OK bright outdoors. I love this phone. The music is pumped through only one speaker, but very loud. I can listen to music on my patio as I BBQ with no extra speakers. The phone is sharp too. The backing is leather finish and the rounded styling is beautiful. The voice command feature is super cool. I highly recommend this phone."
Disappoint Very Much
it's just what I expected
"great phone, size just what I was looking for.. Screen fantastic. Thin and light."
Thank you.
"I love it! It is very useful, fast, beautiful and soon it'll get marshmallow. I really recommend this!."
Excelent!!
"This is simply a great phone for the price. The only drawback to me is the lack of an SD card slot. The new Moto X phones do have the SD slot, all prior generations do not.This is a snappy and responsive phone. It has a decent antenna, and good battery life. I've gotten positive comments on the quality of photos its camera makes, too.Setting it up on my carrier was a snap. Just make sure that whatever phone you buy has the capability to work on your carrier's network, and you should be good to go!"
Ok!
Great phone . didnt realized it didnt have microsd expansión. My bad. But the 8 gb make it. I guess 3d generation will have microsd
I bought this for my sister. She like this phone
Everything was as i expected. Fully satisfied
"I love it! It is very useful, fast, and beautiful. I really recommend this!"
Excelent
Great cel!
"Great phone.Android is almost pure.Don't have updates after 5, it seems, but it has a great hardware, and eventually I'll put cyanogen on it.Screen seems too vivid, but only in the first days.Moto gestures are great too."
the phone speakers is horrible gives an unpleasant feed back
five star
"Perfect phone, that's what I expected!"
"Decent phone starting to show age, watch what you get though it was advertised as a unlocked phone but it's not I received the AT&T branded"
The phone wasn't unlocked and it didn't have a Sims card for it either
Very good all
"I am a late adopter. I am such a late adopter that I don't have a data plan but jump from wi-fi to wi-fi spot. I need a phone with solid hardware and simple tasks like listen to podcast. The phone battery needs to be charged daily. My ex BLU phone needed charging every 3 days. Most of the battery energy is consumed by Google Play services which I don't use often ( no data plan ) but oh well. Is my first OLED phone so I'm impressed with the graphics. The mechanics of this phone are pleasant ( weight, size, responsiveness )."
"For the price, it is still a very good phone (2016) .. But the absence of micro SD slot and FM radio can be a real turn down..If it had those, it would perfect for me."
This phone is SIIIICK!!!! Nice build awesome display quality loud audio through both of the speaker and through whatever headphones you decide to plug in great battery life Motorola never disappoints this phone came out two years ago and is still good compared to today's smartphone I'm using this phone along side an iPhone 7 plus and it runs just as smooth as the iPhone no hiccups or frame drops 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 Stalk android experience this is the pure edition so no crappy bloatware or unnecessary UI skins just perfect 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 And it is upgradable to 6.0 witch is the latest version Android N is on available for a small variety of phones
"""No Verizon SIM card"" message will not go away since this is an unlocked Verizon phone--this is something that the seller did not disclose! Buyer beware..."
"Excellent price, quality and delivery time!"
"This is great fast phone,but have an issue with dinamics-people couldnt hear me while I am on speacker. Also,when I was using it to talk on a Skype-was really bad hearing. This phone has problem with speakers. All other functions are great."
"Great phone, ultra fast and pure android experience.Instant 5.1 upgrade"
i love everything about this phone. Except when i brought it to Verizon to have it activated they told me it was a locked phone! BOOOOOO!! Not what i ordered!Update: I've since received a new moto and its exactly what II ordered. Thank you amazon!
All right. No problems.
Excellent.
nice
"A exceptional phone, specially because it includes Android almost almost Stock"
All good. Met the expectations.
Amazing phone.
Excellent product
"its simply incredible, by far, the best phone i ever had in my life"
All was perfect!
"Excellent! Absolutely new XT1095, very beautiful with bamboo back cover. Powerful, with last Android version."
"Thank you for my smartphone . I am very glad that everything worked very well . Thank you for your prompt delivery and excellent , high-quality goods!"
Well. You told me. I didn't listen. Two days. One feet high... Broken Glass.
"I love the Moto X second Gen for its speedy performance due to it's snapdragon 801, and its amazing display due to its amoled 1080p hd. However no device is perfect and neither is this one, as it lacks a powerful battery, or an amazing camera, but it works and that is not why I gave this product four stars. I gave it four stars due to my products lack of build quality. It was strong but the bamboo was weak and coming off from the bottom. My phone still scratches very easily when putting it in my pocket, I found out it was sand and.... I work in a geotech company.... Besides those two flaws, I love my new phone..."
"Love this phone. Graduated from the Moto G and preciously and iPhone 5 and previously iPhone 4 and 3G. Best phone I've used out of those. Not the highest end specs but phone has a ton of nice but non-overwhelming features. Only minor complant is the Moto Voice doesn't always pick up my voice, but at the bar last night kept cutting on when I never said anything close to my keywords, I've turned that off and went with standard Google now 'OK Google'. 100% RECOMMEND."
Awesome!
"I previously owned a brand new MotoX 1st Generation which I had a love/hate relationship with. I hated the fact it would not hold a charge so it was spending more time on the charger than your average phone. Then one day the chip fell out the charging port so within a year I needed another phone. Since new was not that great I decided I would go for a used MotoX & purchased this one. I love this phone. Its bigger than the 1st Generation, it holds a charge & is totally compatible with AT&T. All I had to do was switch over the SIMS from the old phone to the new phone. It was a simple process with a convenient little tool that was included & was easy to do. Never had to contact the service provider. I love easy...Any phone I have ever ordered on Amazon , no matter who the seller was, had been received quickly & was exactly as it had been described."
"I am so disappointed. It has been less than six months and this phone has completely stopped functioning. It gets super hot when charged, loses its battery within an hour, and no longer charges 90% of the time.This is the first negative review I have ever written. I am BEYOND disappointed."
😀
The screen on this phone is *really* fragile.The performance and battery life are great - I've been quite satisfied by the phone other than this. But it's definitely not up to snuff on durability.I'm going to be replacing mine.
Amazing
"Fast phone. Few scratches because it was used but not noticeable. I have not tested the water proofing yet and don't think I will soon. Other phones look better on paper but I have used a Samsung s6 and this performs better. It doesn't have the lags. Camera is nice too and audio is very loud. Love it. Oh I bought it for my wife but I take every opportunity to ""update and configure it"" just so that I can use it"
"daily use, very powerful nice screen got it on prime deal of the day"
Great phone but it was a t-mobile version that came so sadly i had to return it. it says gsm unlocked but i could not use it with at&t.
"phone has little internal memory, and no way to add more. glass is right to edge of device making it very vulnerable to breaking when dropped. (Found this out the hard way.)"
Screen has an ad for the phone burned in it. Came with knockoff Apple earpods and charger even though the seller said it would come with factory earbuds. Nice phone otherwise.
Great phone. Love it. Best phone I've had so far and I've had something like 35 of them since I used to travel a lot and had to use different phones in other countries.
"Really nice phone overall, camera quality is not very good btw"
Good price
Great ítem! Like new
excelent
worst phone ever... bought one had to return right away as the keys were not working.. bought another one after 30 days the menu key doesn't work.. cannot return now or get it fixed.
"This phone replaced my broken nexus 5 and I couldn't be happier. Great package from Motorola. Screen is big enough for my liking and the phone is easy to handle with one hand. I have the black leather back and it feels very premium.In fact, the phone is so good that my wife and my dad ditched their iPhone and Samsungs for it. It just works. My phone is 2 years old and runs like brand new."
I about used to replace the one I had before. I love this phone so much I didn't want to switch it up.
The phone display stopped working in 6 months and I cannot use the phone.
"great phone, it has 2 things that sucks, battery life and camera"
i bought this during black friday and got it earlier than expected the phone was awsome but all of a sudden feb 1st the phone started to not charge properly i got a new charger and it seemed to act fine so i thought ok i just killed my last charger no big deal but not a few days later it started doing the same thing over and over borrowed a friends new charger and it wouldnt keep a connection to charge it unless i held it in just the right spot and now it will not charge at all it even a lil bit of a connection i looked and it looks like the port on the phone has slide inside and so theres no way to charge it and i cant even get it replaced went to send it back to get it fix or replaced or what ever and nope as of jan 31st i can no longer send it back so now even though its only been a few months im forced to buy a brand new phone this wasnt worth the money i spent on it
"Great phone! If you're looking for a great budget friendly phone, can't go wrong here! Great build quality and features. However once I updated to Android M, I lost some key features such as Motorola assist. :( boo!"
"Don't buy this phone! I bought a Motorola Moto X 2nd generation phone for my college age son to take on a trip to South America. He's pretty careful with phones and is rather tech savvy.Throughout his trip, he contacted me regarding a number of issues he had: the phone kept overheating, poor battery life, poor connectivity (despite the fact that he had an international plan with data). The final nail in the coffin was about three weeks into his trip this phone crashed and upon rebooting the display was black and the phone ran very hot. Imagine trying to help someone troubleshoot something from 6000+ miles away and a 5 hour time difference. Try searching on google for ""Motorola moto x black screen"", there are hundreds of reports of this issue, with very few positive outcomes. The potentially tragic part of this was that my son took 700+ pictures before it failed. We finally gave up and upon his return we spent almost an entire day trying to troubleshoot this issue. Nothing we did changed this situation, all attempts to revive this phone failed. On a positive note, it did manage to connect to my home wifi network and all (we hope) his images did get uploaded to Google via the Photos app we downloaded prior to his departure. I tried everything on the Motorola troubleshooting web page and finally called their technical support line. I spent over an hour on the phone with people who obviously knew nothing about their product. Turns out this is a known issue, for which there is no resolution other than wiping the phone. They offered to repair/replace the phone. The insulting part was that they wanted to charge me a $25 fee for ""expedited replacement"", I opted for the standard free service. Here it is almost two weeks and still no word on when a replacement unit will be sent. I will never purchase another Motorola product as long as I live. Mind you, this is coming from someone who has owned numerous Motorola phones, including my current Motorola Droid Turbo. From now on I will take the advice of my friends and buy more reliable phones such as a Samsung Galaxy or a Google Nexus. Don't waste your money or your time on this device."
"Great phone. I bought it used/recondition. Have been using it about 3 weeks. So far it works great, no problems. It's white with a wood grain back. Looks nice. I bought the Leesentec screen protector. It's the best one I've ever used, easy to put on with no air bubbles. The phone has a 5.2 in. screen and a Quad Core 2.5 GHz processor. It's fastest phone I've ever owned. I only gave $135. I feel I got an excellent deal."
awesome
"It works great, Android is clearly not the best OS but the cellphone is good."
great phone
Everything ok!!!
"The phone itself is good. I bought a second hand one. Unfortunately, Moto X XT1097(my model, I got) has this OLED burnt screen. So, not too great. The seller did not mention it. So, if you do not want a bit burnt/shadowed oled screen mobile phone(used one), do not buy this model."
I need some help in order to use all its facilites.
Would be nice if Amazon sold the 64GB version too.
"Motorola has figured out the right combination of standard and delightful. Standard in that this is a 99% pure Android phone. Delightful in that there are little Moto surprises that don't get in the way of the Android experience. For example, Spotlight Stories sounds kinda cheesy, but it's cute and fun, so well done.The Moto X (2nd gen) is just the right size. Big enough for photos and videos and Chromecast, small enough to fit in phone pockets popular in men's shorts these days. The screen is amazing. Everything is so responsive. I'm sure this will be perfect for me for a couple of years. Amazing that I could get it off-contract for $300.I put an ArmorSuit MilitaryShield on the screen, and a teal Cruzerlite Bugdroid gel case around the back. I really could not be happier!"
excelent phone! great quality
"This phone is fantastic! For those looking for a flag ship phone on a budget, this is your device!"
"I like the software and the look, it ran perfectly. But the screen cracks very easily and a replacement for these guys is $300. Upon replacement, the proximity sensor stopped working which meant as soon as I made a call, the screen went black and I couldn't end the call (I would leave 10 minute long messages unless I manually turned the phone off).I've had this phone for about 3 or 4 months now and the screen has just started going haywire as well. The image content cycles across the screen like it's on a conveyor belt. I've spent $600 on this phone so far and I've been having chronic problems. For me, I regret making the purchase..."
"Everything was perfect, I got the white/Bamboo combo and it is completly unlock device XT1095, sold and shipped by Amazon.This is the best phone you can get right now a completely unlock device go ahead and give it a try!!"
"I think this is a decent phone. I came from Nexus 5 so I can compare both phones. To me, there isn't much difference. Both phones function the same. I don't notice Moto's bigger screen but lower ppi screen. Both screens look good. I do think the Moto has more contrast though.I am not a fan of where the volume buttons and the power buttons on located. They are on the same side. I think they should be on opposite sides. Or they should've been farther apart. I always hit the power button when I'm trying to increase the volume and vice versa. This is one of my least favorite things about this phone.The little indentation on the back is worthless. I don't understand it. Some people like to rest their finger on it. It doesn't work for me. It's uncomfortable.The camera seems same as Nexus 5's. The ring flash is a nice gimmick. But with a flash that small, there isn't much difference. If they wanted to make a ring flash, the flash should circle the entire phone. Then it can give the distinctive, ring-flash look.I'm not a big fan of the speakers either. They feel like buttons, and I always want to push them. They're rough too.Despite by nit-picks, this is still a great phone. It will serve many people's purpose well for a smart phone."
"I bought this phone late in the game, not long before this year's (2015) iteration will launch, so will skip the overview of all the specs and how it stacks up against its competitors and all that ""I wish I was a tech journalist"" nonsense.I wasn't shopping this phone against its competitors, but its predecessor, the original 2013 release of the Moto X, and several other phones in the $200ish range. I bought it at 229 USD, just 30 more than I could have bought its predecessor as new old stock, but lightly used.It has impressed me so far. I've used a few android devices, including a smartphone (Motorola Droid Razr Maxx 'can we add any more names to this thing?') that I used without a SIM, essentially as a miniature tablet for wifi use with a Motorola Tundra as my talk/text device until the Tundra finally died.So, since it's about to be outdated, why don't we look at this phone in detail, but without the ""brand new shiny thing"" glasses of release day, and from the perspective of someone who has used, but not relied upon, smartphones for some time.First, it looks good. In my case, with a white front and bamboo back, I like it, even if I'm not a fan of white on phones, I don't care, my phone's made of g****** bamboo. That's awesome.When you ask for things to happen, they happen. This applies to general performance with touch interaction as well as voice, motion, etc. Without the task bar of a PC, I lose track of all the things running, but I've been shocked when I remember to check on this phone. It runs all of your favorite boring things like Facebook, your bank's app, 11 tabs of different lemon cake recipes, parts searches for a 1996 geo tracker, a 2003 Honda Element, and how to trim your micro SD card into a Nano SD card at the same time while playing music.Durability? As soon as I have the money after this purchase (yes, I'm broke. who else buys year-old phones off-contract to use on Consumer Cellular? yeah, the elderly. Are they writing long reviews on Amazon? No, they are not. Moving on). Anyway, as soon as I have the money, I'll be getting an Otterbox Defender case for this. I love the bamboo, and I ordered a somewhat protective case with a frosted transparent back for it at the same time as the phone, but I kill phones, and this one does not feed especially durable. Not that I expect it to. It's a big ol' ball of performance and fashion statement in a phone, and there's no room there for ""what if it falls of my pocket from a gaoddamn tractor?"".That's why I will, but haven't yet, dropped the cash on a good case.What else do you want to know? It's quick, it works, it's getting cheaper as the new version gets closer, but it's still a great phone and if you really want to pay retail prices you can still get it customized. Just think, you could have the very last custom 2014 version Motorola Moto X. Or you could, like me, get the best used one you can find and pretend it's exactly the way you want it. White front, bamboo back FTW.Anyway, it really is a good device.The last seven words of the last paragraph really should have been my review."
"I received the XT1092 model. This is completely unlocked phone. Needless to say how good the phone is as so many reviewers has already posted their comments. Motorola phones are always have value added features. Like Moto Assist. This phone has surpassed all other phones in features. Namely, Assist, Actions, Voice and Display.Interaction with this phone even when screen is off and cover closed and at a distance is beyond imagination of people who do not own this phone. Further, it comes with the best speech recognition and synthesis. Better than that found in Google Now and Microsoft's Cortana.I migrated from a Moto G 2014 to this phone. Safely to say Motorola is my only choice of phones and my household already have three of them. Go for it, highly recommended, a top quality phone with loaded features beyond the operating system which is Lollipop 5.1"
awful display. very poor image on this cell phone. The background is not clear at all.
Excellent !!!
"Very good cell phone, althought it is very expensive replacement of your screen if broken"
"Great phone... I thought it works in 4g antennas in LatAm but it doesn't.reagarding performance, it is the greater the quicker as expected. Very good phone."
Love this phone had one just like it and I accidentally sat on it so I bought a new one just like it love the bamboo cover wish the screen was larger but the phone is great
"So far so good. I like it. The only thing that caused a little problem is I had to order a ""nano"" SIM card. I was not able to simply take my old SIM card out and insert it in the new phone. I will try and update several months from now..."
The product was everything that I expected from the description. The phone works great and very pleased with the speed of delivery.
"excellent phone, very good price and quality. Four good"
very true to description. Got to say I am pleased so far.
"This phone breaks easily. There's a reason they stopped selling it. Not to mention the description didn't say that ""unlocked"" does NOT mean ""Verizon compatible"". I wasted my money on a rubbish phone that I couldn't use."
Received it quickly works as well as the phone it replaced.
Very good phone. I'm really glad I bought it. It has a good camera and works great.
Best phone ever owned
"It just works. It is fast and flawless. The screen is just the right size, not to big, not too small. Call quality is great. No complaints about this phone."
Very good phone. Seller also work great!
"Its an AT&T phone which has been unlocked so there will be lot of AT&T apps which cannot be uninstalled. You will be better off buying it off the Motorola Website, not only will you get 1 year warranty on the new phone you can also trade in your phone. The phone is great though, it is sleek, the screen size is perfect, the camera is awesome and the Hello Moto X command feature is very useful."
"This phone is just so great! I had a Moto G prior to this and I loved it and this was just the upgrade to continue my love of the Moto family. The apps are easy to navigate and I really like the assistant feature that figures out my life schedule and adapts based on my usage. The phone is intuitive to a casual or business lifestyle, which is great for me as I can flow in and out of official and personal business."
"It is new and working great. Sharp screen, good battery time."
One of the best buys on a phone!
Working perfectly! a really bargain for the price
A+++
ok
"This was my 2nd attempt to purchase the Moto X on Amazon... this was very successful and activated quite nicely. I would highly recommend this phone, but make sure you get an XT1095 or 1097 model. the XT1092 would not connect to the US AT&T network, even after 2 hours of working with the AT&T rep and manager and the tech support line. Even though this phone does not have a microsd card, it does connect up nicely to a micro USB drive... I would recommend it if you are in a marginal reception area for the 4G LTE services."
"Logical system. Nice feel. Love Droid ops.Still waiting to test it outside USA.Said it was from T-MOBILE line of unlocked phones, but T-Mobile said they don't sell it. Regardless, it's working great."
Excellent phone at a great price.
I just love it!
My phone is not working properly and its not getting signal
The best price and quality
"Ordered through Open Group Wireless and they sent me a XT-1092 model, which doesn't match the description at all! The XT-1092 is the European / Chinese version which doesn't have the correct basebands to do T-Mobile LTE. Beware of buying through Open Group Wireless."
It worked as I was waiting
"Great smartphone. Quality build, nice features. So far so good"
Probably the best smartphone out there. Love the bamboo in the back.. Super fast and really smooth. Colors are awesome and camera is great too..
Good quality phone easy to use.
"Beautiful bamboo back, decent battery life, a bit on the larger side compared to Moto X 2013, great Android experience that is close to vanilla."
Excelent!!
Amazing phone.
"This phone is a piece of crap, I have purchased 2 hoping that the broken headphone jack was just luck, but the jack broke on my second phone immediately after the return warranty was up. If you want to use headphones with this phone EVER. Do not consider buying."
I love it! Everything about this phone is great! Highly recommend if you want a good reliable phone that feels premium and performs great.
ok
Great
One of the biggest mistakes I did is to buy this phone on Amazon. Till date since buying the phone in early July I have not been able to place more than 5% of my calls and still have not received a single call on this phone. All the calls drop each and every time. And when i do receive a call not able to pick it up. The dialler functionality to receive calls is horrible. I tried calling motorolla for help regarding this issue and I was told to do a hard reset on the device which I did but the problem still persists.Shame on Motorolla and Amazon to sell such horrible devices.
"Good phone , accesible price."
"got phone today, NOT LOLLIPOP"
"Great cellphone!, no problem with the shipping, all included as said! Recommended of course!"
I loved the near stock android experience
"Best phone ever - love the ""talk to me"" feature - I don't even need to touch my phone anymore, it's the best feature ever! I used to love the iPhone, but I'll never go back to an iPhone again - this phone has changed my life for the better."
EXCELLENT
Amazing phone .Total Value for MoneyWay to go Moto
"This is my second Moto. Excellent phone. Quick, Google now is great, very good HD video."
"Got this for my elder son after his Moto G died. It's a great value for the price, with a respectable camera, Lollypop, good battery life, and that gorgeous wooden backplate. Depending on the specs and reviews of the upcoming Nexus 5, I may replace my aging Nexus 5 with one of these."
excellent seller and product
Great cellphone. Great price. Delivery occurred in 2 days (with Amazon Prime).
I was looking for a replacement for my broken Gen 1 Moto X (which I loved). If this phone were slightly smaller it would be perfect.
Very good cell phone!
Overall it's a pretty decent case. My only complaint is that it is loose around the power button and volume rocker. Besides that it's comfortable to hold and has a good looking design
"Perfect phone. Switched over to Sprint for the iPhone 4 Ever plan, so had to return it."
"Fast, good battery life, decent camera. Amazon deal of the day at $199."
"The phone is sleek, lightweight and user friendly and the performance is great. But it looks like its a used/returned item. have few dents on the leather, and the protective screen is not intact (Its advertised as brand new though)."
"The phone's performance is what was expected. But beware of Amazon, this phone looked like it was a returned. The back plate had some dents to it and the plastic screen cover had dust bubbles. Obviously it was taken out of the box. When you buy something labeled as Brand New it ought to be Brand New!"
"I am coming from aa note 3 to this and it amazes me how different everything is. I have had a moto g 2014, blu vivo air, iPhone 5s, note3, s2,3,4,5, lg g flex, and the list goes on and on.... Out of all the phones I have had this one is the bestProsFast! (As fast as dropping a stick of butter!)Solid buildAwesome call qualityGood signal strengthFast charge!!!!!Ambient screen!Latest updates!ConsNo upgradeable sd card slot :'-("
for a little while a couple weeks after I first started using it the auto rotate didn't work. I went online and saw it is not uncommon problem. Solution is to whack phone hard against your thigh.Battery life doesn't seem too great.Otherwise it is OK phone
Just loved it..Worth the price...
"Great phone. Comes with all the tools you would ever need and of course there are tons of apps to choose from. Large, sleek, fast and fun."
:)
"So I received the phone yesterday on a deal of the day special of $199 Amazon had this past week and thought ""Wow"" this is such a great deal until I realized it was only in 16gb. I thought really? They still make 16gb phones these days? Why? Well at least it has SD expansion and then realized it didn't. Once again, why not? If your only providing 16gb why not include SD expansion (makes no sense whatsoever).So I hesitated but thought well I can probably live with 16gb since I have cloud storage and a tablet with SD card so I pulled the trigger ($199 is had to pass up). I ordered the black leather edition and upon receiving it and holding it I was very pleased. It's beautiful to look at and hold and very well constructed as others have mentioned. The smell and feel of leather is unsurpassed by any other phone I have used prior (iPhones, Samsungs, LG's) the arched back design also allows for a superior hold in the hand.So all is well I thought, I'm loving it. I turned it on and immediately went to the storage capacity and I was blown away! Only 10.2 GB of available storage!!! What the hell how could this be? There must be some kind of mistake this is ridiculous! I was immediately prompted to update the software to Lollipop which I did and after updating all firmware and the outdated KitKat it came installed with and adding Whatsapp, CBS Sports and Slacker I was left with a repulsive 7.9 GB of available storage, I mean seriously this is a joke!How in the world does a 16gb device take up 6gb for the OS? Perhaps 2gb maybe 3 but 6? And if so why the hell isn't it advertised? Instead of 16gb it should be sold as ""10gb of usable storage"" I would have never purchased it...So yes the phone is pretty to look at and hold and yes the OS is stock android which craps on everything else but the usable storage of the Moto X is not reasonable and therefore I cannot recommend it especially if this is your go to phone and plan on having it for a while. With more apps, a few songs and constant app updates you will run out of storage in no time and your phone will begin to lag.If Moto is going to undercut the storage than at least provide an SD slot. Perhaps go for the 32gb or just get a Nexus. I mean really my LG Optimus G (E970) from 2012 is also 16gb, has a ton of AT&T and LG Bloatware and yet still has 11.8GB leftover of usable storage AND includes SD expansion and that's a 3 year old phone!!!"
New like out of the Factory!!
"This is one of the best smartphones you can buy under $300. I admit that this is not the latest Moto X, but for general purposes of general people, this phone is perfect. Its screen size is just perfect for one-handed use and media consumption, but the phone is not very big. The phone also feels substantial in hand, thanks to its very solid construction. The screen also offers very deep blacks and saturated colors. Only thing mediocre about this phone is the camera. That doesn't mean its got a bad camera, but the camera is just average in an otherwise awesome phone."
Great phone! Only reason why it is 3 stars is there is no expandable sd card slot (1 star) and you can't remove the battery (1 star)
👍
Probably the best smartphone out there. Love the bamboo in the back.. Super fast and really smooth. Colors are awesome and camera is great too..
Good quality phone easy to use.
Great value for the sale ($199 when I bought it) price. Can't be beat. Motorola's 2014 Flagship just a year old in November of 2015... for only $199? Kind of wish I grabbed a pair.
"Becomes a memory hog after few weeks of usage. The phone didn't come with a charger, even though it came directly from Amazon."
"Exceptional.I used the previous version of this and it was great.Now, this one had a problem and I sent it back for repair.I called the number in order to know what was wrong with it, andthey told me that they can't tell that. Sounds strange to me."
Great
Excellent phone. I love Motorola. The price was good.
👍
The OS used more memory than expected and if I did it again I would have bought the 32GB. Other than that it works awesome!
good phone especially when you get it at the right price. After using one for a while myself I bought this one for my mom. its pure android with no BS in the interface except the integral moto voice stuff which enables it to be awakened to answer a question . that function can work pretty well once set up right and trained to your command but there seem to be some conflicts with the 'ok google' function that is similar.Some little things like the twist to take a photo and the karate chop gesture to turn on the flashlight are cool.
"Pretty decent product with a reasonable price. Strong WiFi detection and stable WiFi connection all the time. It is however a little too big for my hand, but a bigger screen is always desired."
"Been using this phone for a few weeks now and is very user friendly, besides the internet browser. Not sure how to access previous tabs or open new ones, but will figure it out in time. I switched to the Moto X from a Samsung Galaxy S3 and is essentially the same thing minus the Samsung and mobile carrier clutter. Vibrant colors and fast. Get it!P.S. the wood back is definitely a conversation starter and a bragging point for a stylish phone."
Great phone.Best price/quality relation I've yet seen.
Everything was perfect!
Excelence the whole buing process
NO SD card !!!!! that says it all for an Android phone.
Very good for the price paid.
So far--great phone!
Excellent product. I like it a lot.
"Overall, it is a really great phone, but has an inherent flaw in that signal reception is comparatively poor for the actual carrier network. One would assume that Motorola (famous for radios) would offer a superior product. I have a six year old Samsung that reliably receives calls and text messages where the Moto X does not. This issue has forced me to return this phone which, otherwise, is pretty fantastic."
"Good cellphone for the price. Just the camera is not as good as you expect from a modern phone, when it is a bit dark the camera just take bad pictures, and also it is difficult to focus. But I had already known it before buying, so this is not a problem."
Great!
The best smarphone I've ever owned.
"It's a Motorola, what more needs to be said?"
"I get a moto phone g2 generation, it was not it purchases"
"One of the best smartphones you can buy for it's price, really love what Motorola has done with this phone."
"This is my forth smart phone, started with a Motorola Spice Key (keyboard <3), then went to some second hand LG, then Moto G 2014. This is the first one that I feel alleviates my need for a paper notebook. This and the Spice Key are the two I feel comfortable calling a tool.Note on usage: I use this and the previous phones listed more as a small tablet (Spice Key as a PDA) than a phone and I've always had another device I use as a phone."
very good
The phone case causes the microphone to reverberate. Almost everyone I call complains about the echo. If I remove the case no problems. This is a serious defect and should be fixed.
Hate this phone. Had a busted up Samsung Note 2 and there is a huge difference... My old beat up Samsung was superior! You cannot block calls or texts using this Moto X device. I downloaded several apps just to try to block numbers and texts on this phone with no luck. Spend the extra money to buy a better phone. The only good thing about this phone is size and the price (but you get what you pay for with bad quality and horrible camera).
Love it. I have a moto G and got this for my mom. It's bigger and better. Only downside is that the power button is super sensitive so it keeps turning on in her pocket.
"Great performance, but battery life could be better. Also where is marshmallow?"
Great phone at a Great price. It was a Verizon phone originally tho not Att as the ad specified. The seller offered a refund tho so buy with confidence.
"my first moto x, everything works well so far except for the camera, it is incredibly difficult to have the camera come into focus, i have to move it close, away, close, away, to try and have the focus come out clear. the pictures are fine once i can get the camera in focus."
"This phone has the worst sreen i ever had. Don t buy it, it s too fragile.Now i have to replace it and cost, half the phone."
"I think i wasnt luck this time...i bought two of theese...one of them get brickes after two days and four software upgrades... Had to return it...the other one is perfect...great size, great speed and featured... Im using it in argentina without any kind of problem."
Excellent phone. Very good cost benefit. Higly recomended.
Perfect
"So I gave it a few weeks and at this point I must say I am very pleased with my Moto X 2nd Gen. It is very quick and smooth, take pictures well and calls are crystal clear. It has "" learned "" my voice and responds as well as any iPhone I have seen.It fits my hand and pocket well, screen is large enough for me ( I wouldn't want it much larger if at all ). I still have much to learn in the Android platform but as for the phone itself, I have no complaints. I was worried about battery life but thus far it has been very good for my use ( not a ultra heavy user tho ) and lasts me all day and well into the next."
I love this phone. Absolutely could not beat the price when I got it. I have had this phone for a just over a month now and here are my pros/cons.Pros:Great quality buildHigh Screen-to-Body %The AMOLED screen is crisp and so black that sometimes I can't discern the screen from the front fascia border.Moto Assist. I am now spoiled by the motion activated screen for checking notifications.Cons:Battery life is not very good. I just had to increase my charging frequency. Drains especially fast during continuous use.Moto Assist. The screen basically turns on whenever something passes over it not just a hand.
Awesome phone for the price! Love it! Great for everyday tasks and use. Long battery life.
Great phone
Purchased this for my wife and she loves it; got her Galaxy II and love it too!
Speaker was faulty. Terrible chiming sound.
Great phone
"Nice phone, just as expected. Almost stock Android with a couple nice extra features... Battery life not that great but ok."
The phone arrived in flawless condition. Appeared brand new!!! This is now officially the BEST phone I've ever owned and the cheapest I've ever paid for one. LOVE IT!!! Would definitely purchase from warehouse deals again.
"Let me preface this by saying that only 1.5 months ago, I really liked Motorola and loved my Moto X. Sadly, I cracked its screen, and even though I could fix it myself (I've done many phone repairs) I paid $130 to send it to Motorola for the original manufacturer parts and repair warranty. I figured I was paying for ease and convenience.I was so wrong.Almost two weeks passed without indication they had received my device. I called in a serious of support specialists before finally being forwarded to the escalation team, who took about 30 minutes to locate my phone, verify it had been received, and assue me that it would be sent back to me within 5 business days.But that wasn't the end.5 days later and no word from Motorola. I called again. Support informed me that, actually, they could not replace my Moto X. 'Replace' is the word they used. But wait - they are supposed to be repairing it, right? Wrong. Apparently they just send you a refurished edition of the same model. So they no longer had my original phone and could not even replace it with the same model.The representative offered me an 'upgrade' to the Nexus 6, which I absolutely HATE. It was way too big for me (I am a woman with small hands) and they are apparently completely unable to provide a Moto X Pure, which is the closest thing to what I have now. Somehow, it's not in stock? How is MOTOROLA, the company who MAKES the Moto X Pure supposed to be 'out of stock'?Anyway, they assured me the Nexus would ship in 5 business days. Here we are, 8 business days later, and STILL nothing. I called in at this point to demand a refund for all the inconvence, which I was informed they ""do not owe me"" because I agreed to receive a Nexus 6. Mind you, I agreed to a replacement for my LOST device - I did NOT agree that the replacement would be satisfactory compensation for all this grief and aggravation.This has been absolutely, by FAR, the worst customer service experience I have ever suffered through. On top of everything described, each representative could barely speak English, was dismissive and rude with me, and clearly barely trained, just reading off a script. I cannot express how enough how disappointed I am given how much I enjoyed the original product.At this point, I am only eager to receive my 'upgrade' to the Nexus 6 in order to promptly sell it, never buy anything Lenovo or Motorola again, and make it my life's mission to make sure everyone else knows how awful this company is, too.In sum, stay away from Motorola; while they make a decent product, should anything go wrong, God forbid, they will not support you and determine instead to make your life miserable."
Phone arrived in good condition. But when I tried to activate it with Verizon they said there was an issue with the IMEI number. The only thing I could do is return it.
"Love it. Mine arrived in an opened box, but otherwise looked untouched."
"Great. Battery life is only 4 stars, performance is good. Nice and light. OK camera. Great speakers"
i sent it back!!!!
OUTSTANDING!!! Top notch service and shipped on time. Great product. Would recommend.
I love it.
Good.
Great phone
Good phone. But the screen cracked on the first fall. Probably weaker of the smartphones out there.
Best phone I had!
I love this phone!
"Pro:EVERYTHING (I had a nexus 5 and it was jut pain with signal and quality. My NEXUS 5 BENT)- Aluminum housing- Fast and Furious- Hanged only 1 time so far in 3 months (mutiple calls, fb, whatsapp, etc)- NEXUS 5 killerCons:- Whoever was the camera engineer should be fired. My 5 year old digi cam takes better quality pictures in DARK.- IN low light camera is like a day without a laugh (USELESS)"
"This phone has exceeded all of my expectations. The screen is wonderful, the battery long lasting. The stock Android experience is a wonderful thing. Want a great phone service experience? Get this phone and pick your own provider. I LOVE IT."
"Own a lg g4,htc m7 & m8,iPhone 5s and now a moto x second gen. Love my moto the best! Customized to me, sharp screen,fast,light,easy to set up from old phone. Buying my wife a moto g!"
"Very good phone, will recomend to anyone"
Is amazing!
Total happiness!
Good
"I got a brand-new unoppend with the plastic on!i don't know about the screen a lot if it brakes easly or not but i don't want to find out, anyway i need to protect my phone... for me IT IS PERFECT!It was so good so I bought anthor one for my sister which came in a perfect condition!!!"
Very satisfied with the purchase. As good as its rivals which are 2X the price.
Awesome phone :-)
Excelente
everything it's OK
"Week two of my Moto X. Thankfully I was delivered the XT1095 model. This happened to be a big issue for me as I'm using it in South Africa and this page/seller had no real conclusive information that the XT1095 'Pure Edition' was available.To help any other foreign potential buyers out the XT1095 is truly a 'global phone'. I can't vouch for the Unlocked AT&T version but this XT1095 version works perfectly abroad. The only issue I'm experiencing is that it isn't picking up 4G on the CellC network however this may be due to a coverage issue and not missing band problem. Apart from that the HSDPA+ works perfectly with strong signal.The device itself is built great with the metal band and (in my case) bamboo back giving it an air of quality few can match at the price. Regarding the numerous reviews targeting the brittle screen which was a big concern of mine, I have no screen protector (I do have a case) and am pleased to report zero issues thus far with scratches or cracks. I look after it but don't feel I treat it any differently from my old phone. Its still early days with the phone but so far I am pleased with the durability of the gorgeous AMOLED screen.I haven't had a chance to truly test the camera but did notice the rather simple UI for the camera app. The few pictures I've taken were adequate in low light. However in well lit scenes it shines, matching higher priced rivals. The performance of the phone is smooth and without issue. It may not have the latest and greatest hardware but running the pure Andriod experience it moves swiftly. This in conjunction with the motion sensors that light up your display, showing notifications when reaching for your phone really made me look at phones differently. Features like this that are usually gimmicks on other brands end up being so useful with this Moto X that you really miss them when using a friends phone. It's not the hardware that defines the phone exclusively, it's how it all comes together and this Moto X (2nd Gen) has excelled in that regard.My only issue would be the battery life. Charges last a full day with wifi only pushing two. Hard usage drops this but the inclusion of a fast charger, which works great, is appreciated A bigger capacity battery would have truly taking this phone to another level. If you can go the route of a 32Gb model I suggest you do as a total usable space of 10.17GB isn't much. Add some music and a couple of apps/movies/pictures and that number depletes quickly.Overall for the price (trust me I researched every available option) this phone in my opinion is one of, if not the best you can get for $300. An easy phone to recommend."
"Great phone. I have moto x 1st generation and love it. Bought this one for my wife and she is happy with it. First charge held for 3 full days with very moderate use, and camera update fixed focusing issue. All the rest is great as it should be."
My husband cannot stop singing the praises of this phone.
"I upgraded from the Moto G. This phone has a lot of similar features since it is also a Motorola, but some of the new things I like are:- Wave your hand over the phone to see time/notifications- Quick glance of notifications without unlocking- Voice feature (Can ask questions, even when locked)- ""Talk to me"" feature - phone will read all notifications out loud for 30 mins. Perfect for when you're in the shower/doing dishes/etc.- Much better camera than the Moto G- Motion sensor actions (twist twice to open camera, karate chop down twice for flashlight)Overall, it just has some neat added features. It has been a tiny bit laggy at times, which is annoying (ex. going to Google search bar and the keyboard takes a few seconds to come up). But overall, I really like it."
"It's a really good cellphone but it doesn't support sd card, and the gallery doesn't offer to many options, for example you can't hide an album"
good a pure android phone
"Shipped very fast, great phone"
Turning off the moto features will keep the phone cool otherwise it burns like hell.
The leather back gets full scratches.It says it has 16 gig but it only has 10 gig. False advertising!!
Fantastic!
"I had the first generation Moto X for two years. Used to love it, the size, the speed, the practicality of a compact phone with decent performance. I decided to go with the second gen, amidst the launch of the third generation due to the size, specs, and price. So far I've been impressed. I'll admit that I'm still getting used to the larger screen, but this phone sure is fast. The bear stock Android experience is a welcome addition, and the small enhancements Motorola added to it are more than welcomed. If you're looking for a great phone and a low cost and want it to simply work, get this one. The camera is ho-hum, I've seen better. But for my needs, its more than adequate."
"The best mid-range Android phone in my opinion.Pros:- Nice screen. Bright, vivid, responsive.- Good quality body- Nice camera- Fast charging battery- Sound quality is good- Very clean Android (nearly default experience)- An extra chip just to track movement and respond.Cons:- Only one: Default launcher is not good. But you can install from tons of choices from Google Play. I prefer KK Launcher."
"Best phone I had so far. Moved to it from a OnePlus One, which was good, but a little too big."
Excellent phone and was delivered on time.
"Great device, best value in a full HD phone."
"Fast delivery. Although used, the phone is absolutely indistinguishable from a brand-new one. I am very satisfied."
bought it for my mom. Her first smartphone. She loves it.
Excellent
Love this phone.
Great deal on Amazon and a great phone.
Having owned several Motorola products. More important. Having repaired them for 30 yrs. I feel they are the Harleys of the communications products available today. I broke the screen within 2 months because of my careless handling and a well directed fall. Repaired all for less than $30. Since then I have purchased 2 more for my kids. They are very pleased. Take note of the fragile screen comments. Providing a nice bumper frame case. You can take advantage of the numerous options available.
Description did not match unit. New screen but bad back and dinged corners and damaged moto x badge. Description read slight screen image but good back. Was able to replace bad parts with my good parts but still not as described. Also came with AT&T bloatware that I can't get rid of even as I thought I was getting a T-Mobile phone.
"Love it, love it!"
it's a great phone. this is my second one (i dropped the first one on a tile floor) and i liked it so well i bought one for my wife.
"Bought for Girlfriend after she broke her 5S. She likes it, very good phone. Beautiful screen. Complaints are: No home button, battery could be better, camera doesn't focus very well. Good for the price. Nice stop-gap phone. Will be good for a year or so. Definitely recommend if that's the situation for you."
perfect
Battery life and it's difficulty to connect with metro pcs are the biggest and probably only drawbacks to this phone. Works amazingly but will not last an average days use compared to other moto products.

"I love it! It is very useful, fast, beautiful and soon it'll get marshmallow. I really recommend this!."
Excelent!!
"This is simply a great phone for the price. The only drawback to me is the lack of an SD card slot. The new Moto X phones do have the SD slot, all prior generations do not.This is a snappy and responsive phone. It has a decent antenna, and good battery life. I've gotten positive comments on the quality of photos its camera makes, too.Setting it up on my carrier was a snap. Just make sure that whatever phone you buy has the capability to work on your carrier's network, and you should be good to go!"
Ok!
Great phone . didnt realized it didnt have microsd expansión. My bad. But the 8 gb make it. I guess 3d generation will have microsd
I bought this for my sister. She like this phone
Everything was as i expected. Fully satisfied
"I love it! It is very useful, fast, and beautiful. I really recommend this!"
Excelent
Great cel!
Very good phone. I'm really glad I bought it. It has a good camera and works great.
Best phone ever owned
"It just works. It is fast and flawless. The screen is just the right size, not to big, not too small. Call quality is great. No complaints about this phone."
Very good phone. Seller also work great!
"Its an AT&T phone which has been unlocked so there will be lot of AT&T apps which cannot be uninstalled. You will be better off buying it off the Motorola Website, not only will you get 1 year warranty on the new phone you can also trade in your phone. The phone is great though, it is sleek, the screen size is perfect, the camera is awesome and the Hello Moto X command feature is very useful."
"This phone is just so great! I had a Moto G prior to this and I loved it and this was just the upgrade to continue my love of the Moto family. The apps are easy to navigate and I really like the assistant feature that figures out my life schedule and adapts based on my usage. The phone is intuitive to a casual or business lifestyle, which is great for me as I can flow in and out of official and personal business."
"It is new and working great. Sharp screen, good battery time."
One of the best buys on a phone!
Working perfectly! a really bargain for the price
A+++
i bought this during black friday and got it earlier than expected the phone was awsome but all of a sudden feb 1st the phone started to not charge properly i got a new charger and it seemed to act fine so i thought ok i just killed my last charger no big deal but not a few days later it started doing the same thing over and over borrowed a friends new charger and it wouldnt keep a connection to charge it unless i held it in just the right spot and now it will not charge at all it even a lil bit of a connection i looked and it looks like the port on the phone has slide inside and so theres no way to charge it and i cant even get it replaced went to send it back to get it fix or replaced or what ever and nope as of jan 31st i can no longer send it back so now even though its only been a few months im forced to buy a brand new phone this wasnt worth the money i spent on it
"Great phone! If you're looking for a great budget friendly phone, can't go wrong here! Great build quality and features. However once I updated to Android M, I lost some key features such as Motorola assist. :( boo!"
"Don't buy this phone! I bought a Motorola Moto X 2nd generation phone for my college age son to take on a trip to South America. He's pretty careful with phones and is rather tech savvy.Throughout his trip, he contacted me regarding a number of issues he had: the phone kept overheating, poor battery life, poor connectivity (despite the fact that he had an international plan with data). The final nail in the coffin was about three weeks into his trip this phone crashed and upon rebooting the display was black and the phone ran very hot. Imagine trying to help someone troubleshoot something from 6000+ miles away and a 5 hour time difference. Try searching on google for ""Motorola moto x black screen"", there are hundreds of reports of this issue, with very few positive outcomes. The potentially tragic part of this was that my son took 700+ pictures before it failed. We finally gave up and upon his return we spent almost an entire day trying to troubleshoot this issue. Nothing we did changed this situation, all attempts to revive this phone failed. On a positive note, it did manage to connect to my home wifi network and all (we hope) his images did get uploaded to Google via the Photos app we downloaded prior to his departure. I tried everything on the Motorola troubleshooting web page and finally called their technical support line. I spent over an hour on the phone with people who obviously knew nothing about their product. Turns out this is a known issue, for which there is no resolution other than wiping the phone. They offered to repair/replace the phone. The insulting part was that they wanted to charge me a $25 fee for ""expedited replacement"", I opted for the standard free service. Here it is almost two weeks and still no word on when a replacement unit will be sent. I will never purchase another Motorola product as long as I live. Mind you, this is coming from someone who has owned numerous Motorola phones, including my current Motorola Droid Turbo. From now on I will take the advice of my friends and buy more reliable phones such as a Samsung Galaxy or a Google Nexus. Don't waste your money or your time on this device."
"Great phone. I bought it used/recondition. Have been using it about 3 weeks. So far it works great, no problems. It's white with a wood grain back. Looks nice. I bought the Leesentec screen protector. It's the best one I've ever used, easy to put on with no air bubbles. The phone has a 5.2 in. screen and a Quad Core 2.5 GHz processor. It's fastest phone I've ever owned. I only gave $135. I feel I got an excellent deal."
awesome
"It works great, Android is clearly not the best OS but the cellphone is good."
great phone
Everything ok!!!
"The phone itself is good. I bought a second hand one. Unfortunately, Moto X XT1097(my model, I got) has this OLED burnt screen. So, not too great. The seller did not mention it. So, if you do not want a bit burnt/shadowed oled screen mobile phone(used one), do not buy this model."
I need some help in order to use all its facilites.
Total happiness!

"Great phone, great price."
This phone has been great. I was able to get it for $200 on a lightning deal. A much better deal than paying $600 for a Galaxy or an IPhone.
Great value for the sale ($199 when I bought it) price. Can't be beat. Motorola's 2014 Flagship just a year old in November of 2015... for only $199? Kind of wish I grabbed a pair.

Perfect for when you're in the shower/doing dishes/etc.- Much better camera than the Moto G- Motion sensor actions (twist twice to open camera, karate chop down twice for flashlight)Overall, it just has some neat added features. It has been a tiny bit laggy at times, which is annoying (ex. going to Google search bar and the keyboard takes a few seconds to come up). But overall, I really like it."
"It's a really good cellphone but it doesn't support sd card, and the gallery doesn't offer to many options, for example you can't hide an album"
good a pure android phone
"Shipped very fast, great phone"
Turning off the moto features will keep the phone cool otherwise it burns like hell.
The leather back gets full scratches.It says it has 16 gig but it only has 10 gig. False advertising!!
Fantastic!
"I had the first generation Moto X for two years. Used to love it, the size, the speed, the practicality of a compact phone with decent performance. I decided to go with the second gen, amidst the launch of the third generation due to the size, specs, and price. So far I've been impressed. I'll admit that I'm still getting used to the larger screen, but this phone sure is fast. The bear stock Android experience is a welcome addition, and the small enhancements Motorola added to it are more than welcomed. If you're looking for a great phone and a low cost and want it to simply work, get this one. The camera is ho-hum, I've seen better. But for my needs, its more than adequate."
"The best mid-range Android phone in my opinion.Pros:- Nice screen. Bright, vivid, responsive.- Good quality body- Nice camera- Fast charging battery- Sound quality is good- Very clean Android (nearly default experience)- An extra chip just to track movement and respond.Cons:- Only one: Default launcher is not good. But you can install from tons of choices from Google Play. I prefer KK Launcher."
"Best phone I had so far. Moved to it from a OnePlus One, which was good, but a little too big."
"Why is xt1097, instead xt1095"
"excellent seller, arrived quickly and as described, satisfied with my cell"
Perfect! And arrived sooner than expected!
"I found out when i went to get this phone fixed that I was sold a pre used phone. I fully thought I was paying for a new unused phone. anyways the phone didn't last a week, the screen will not turn on and I'm told it's 200 dollars plus to replace. might as well just buy a new phone."
Everything was fine!
"Great phone. pure andriod, love their apps. it figures out that you're driving and would tell you when someone is calling or sending you a text.battery lasts a day most of the time."
Its an Excellent phone The programms of like AT&T and T-Mobil sometimes are annoying
The phone is great. The connection to the ATT network can be problematic at times even when there are cell towers close by.Bought two phones. One updated to Lollipop 5.1 while the other is still using 5.0. Not sure why the delay in updating the Android software in the other phone. Overall very nice phone that could someday earn five stars if service connection problems are addressed.
Make sure you do NOT buy from Open Group Wireless! Even though the model is shown as XT1095 I received an XT1092 which will NOT work properly (above 2G) on US GMS networks!I made the mistake of only looking at reviews after purchasing from them. Others have reported the same problem!
Excellent!!!!
I've just started setting up the phone. It is going good so far. The phone looks brand new. Very satisfied at this point
the best!
All good !
"Amazing cell phone, my daughter like it so much."
"With the Canadian dollar tanking, it ended up costing more than expected...but still awesome phone. Replacing a Nexus4 and seems to excel in every way, especially for the price"
Very good device
Only cons is that it doesn't allow a memory card. But the cell phone is excellent
Nice Phone!! Thanks!!
Love the phone so far...have only had it for a week though.
"Great phone. No problems whatsoever. Camera could be better, but still works great in good lighting."
"works great. great condition, and fast shipping what more could you ask for!"
Great!
"I got a brand-new unoppend with the plastic on!i don't know about the screen a lot if it brakes easly or not but i don't want to find out, anyway i need to protect my phone... for me IT IS PERFECT!It was so good so I bought anthor one for my sister which came in a perfect condition!!!"
Very satisfied with the purchase. As good as its rivals which are 2X the price.
Awesome phone :-)
Excelente
everything it's OK
"Week two of my Moto X. Thankfully I was delivered the XT1095 model. This happened to be a big issue for me as I'm using it in South Africa and this page/seller had no real conclusive information that the XT1095 'Pure Edition' was available.To help any other foreign potential buyers out the XT1095 is truly a 'global phone'. I can't vouch for the Unlocked AT&T version but this XT1095 version works perfectly abroad. The only issue I'm experiencing is that it isn't picking up 4G on the CellC network however this may be due to a coverage issue and not missing band problem. Apart from that the HSDPA+ works perfectly with strong signal.The device itself is built great with the metal band and (in my case) bamboo back giving it an air of quality few can match at the price. Regarding the numerous reviews targeting the brittle screen which was a big concern of mine, I have no screen protector (I do have a case) and am pleased to report zero issues thus far with scratches or cracks. I look after it but don't feel I treat it any differently from my old phone. Its still early days with the phone but so far I am pleased with the durability of the gorgeous AMOLED screen.I haven't had a chance to truly test the camera but did notice the rather simple UI for the camera app. The few pictures I've taken were adequate in low light. However in well lit scenes it shines, matching higher priced rivals. The performance of the phone is smooth and without issue. It may not have the latest and greatest hardware but running the pure Andriod experience it moves swiftly. This in conjunction with the motion sensors that light up your display, showing notifications when reaching for your phone really made me look at phones differently. Features like this that are usually gimmicks on other brands end up being so useful with this Moto X that you really miss them when using a friends phone. It's not the hardware that defines the phone exclusively, it's how it all comes together and this Moto X (2nd Gen) has excelled in that regard.My only issue would be the battery life. Charges last a full day with wifi only pushing two. Hard usage drops this but the inclusion of a fast charger, which works great, is appreciated A bigger capacity battery would have truly taking this phone to another level. If you can go the route of a 32Gb model I suggest you do as a total usable space of 10.17GB isn't much. Add some music and a couple of apps/movies/pictures and that number depletes quickly.Overall for the price (trust me I researched every available option) this phone in my opinion is one of, if not the best you can get for $300. An easy phone to recommend."
"Great phone. I have moto x 1st generation and love it. Bought this one for my wife and she is happy with it. First charge held for 3 full days with very moderate use, and camera update fixed focusing issue. All the rest is great as it should be."
My husband cannot stop singing the praises of this phone.
"I previously owned a brand new MotoX 1st Generation which I had a love/hate relationship with. I hated the fact it would not hold a charge so it was spending more time on the charger than your average phone. Then one day the chip fell out the charging port so within a year I needed another phone. Since new was not that great I decided I would go for a used MotoX & purchased this one. I love this phone. Its bigger than the 1st Generation, it holds a charge & is totally compatible with AT&T. All I had to do was switch over the SIMS from the old phone to the new phone. It was a simple process with a convenient little tool that was included & was easy to do. Never had to contact the service provider. I love easy...Any phone I have ever ordered on Amazon , no matter who the seller was, had been received quickly & was exactly as it had been described."
"I am so disappointed. It has been less than six months and this phone has completely stopped functioning. It gets super hot when charged, loses its battery within an hour, and no longer charges 90% of the time.This is the first negative review I have ever written. I am BEYOND disappointed."
😀
The screen on this phone is *really* fragile.The performance and battery life are great - I've been quite satisfied by the phone other than this. But it's definitely not up to snuff on durability.I'm going to be replacing mine.
Amazing
"Fast phone. Few scratches because it was used but not noticeable. I have not tested the water proofing yet and don't think I will soon. Other phones look better on paper but I have used a Samsung s6 and this performs better. It doesn't have the lags. Camera is nice too and audio is very loud. Love it. Oh I bought it for my wife but I take every opportunity to ""update and configure it"" just so that I can use it"
"daily use, very powerful nice screen got it on prime deal of the day"
Great phone but it was a t-mobile version that came so sadly i had to return it. it says gsm unlocked but i could not use it with at&t.
"phone has little internal memory, and no way to add more. glass is right to edge of device making it very vulnerable to breaking when dropped. (Found this out the hard way.)"
Screen has an ad for the phone burned in it. Came with knockoff Apple earpods and charger even though the seller said it would come with factory earbuds. Nice phone otherwise.
Good.
Great phone
Just received phone few hours ago but was very impressed that the phone was exactly as stated in sell information. Set up went smoothly and Moto X 2nd gen.is a great step up from Moto G. I couldn't be happier with purchase. Great valve.
Works perfectly. Not a single complaint.
"Great phone for the price. Very good screen resolution. Love the ability to look at messages, etc., without having to unlock phone first. Too bad it doesn't have memory card ability, but still a great phone."
"Outstanding product. Does everything I need. I couldn't see spending twice the price to get an apple product. No contract and unlocked is the only way to fly. Phone feels solid, not like a piece of plastic. Email and web browsing are a snap. Calendar is useful."
Its performance is not the best now but still works very well.
purchase a 2nd generation motorola supposedly very good and I arrived with damaged screen
"Great, got it for $139 from Amazon Whorehouse deals.It rocks as far as performance and quality. MUST BUY, if below $150... nothing better available for the price."
showed up at my doorstep as advertised. no problems yet after 2 months of usage.
"Pretty decent product with a reasonable price. Strong WiFi detection and stable WiFi connection all the time. It is however a little too big for my hand, but a bigger screen is always desired."
"Been using this phone for a few weeks now and is very user friendly, besides the internet browser. Not sure how to access previous tabs or open new ones, but will figure it out in time. I switched to the Moto X from a Samsung Galaxy S3 and is essentially the same thing minus the Samsung and mobile carrier clutter. Vibrant colors and fast. Get it!P.S. the wood back is definitely a conversation starter and a bragging point for a stylish phone."
Phone was advertised as unlocked but came locked to Verizon. Had to call and get that taken care of before it could be used.
"Everything from the packaging to the phone was just amazing. I got it when it said that it was going to be back in stock at a later sate bbut then the shipping was bumped up to the same week so don't be afraid of the in stock later date.The phone is amazing. Depending on your internet speed, it will take a while for the four updates to take places; it goes from Kitkat, to the latest Lollipop and Marshmallow is expected soon.Apart from that, everything is great from the screen (super bright and vibrant) to the performance (which is impeccable for the price - I got 44000 on Antutu after downloading some apps. It got 30 - 50 FPS in the game region which is great. The phone is just really fast and can compete with the big flagship phones) to the gameplay (which is very fluid with no lag issues on arcade games, haven't tried frame intensive games) to the camera (absolutely amazing especially in apps like Instagram and Snapchat) to the microphones (I could talk to it from a good few feet away in the ideal conditions). The only thing is no SD card slot but everything else is great. Not to mention the cool Moto features and NFC support.3 days updateThe phone is still holding beautifully.It better than ever with around 5GB left in storage (after downloading a lot of games and social media apps). Just monitor your storage so you don't use it up all at once. But as it is, the phone is functioning beautifully and it working like a charm.It still doesn't lag and functions beautifully and the more graphic intensive games like FIFA 15 and easily handles games like Crossy Road with ease. Day to day tasks are even smoother with no stuttering, just fluid actions from opening apps to using them for long periods of time to jumping from one to another; the RAM is holding up spectacularly.I would highly recommend getting a quick charger with it so you can keep it charged. You'll need it if you use your phone alot.All the Moto Actions still work and as time passes, the phone gets to know you better so it appears to work better over time (just make sure all the apps are up to date).Just a really great phone overall. If I had a Micro SD card slot, there'd be nothing stopping it but it does support USB OTG (so to some measure, the phone is perfect)."
works fine............ I don't find GPS
"I bought it for my daughter. She loves the clear display and the OS. She wishes that it supported additional SD memory card. That was her only complaint. The size is good (not too big, not too small). She loves the bamboo feels. Samsung and Apple get most of the media attention when it comes to smartphones, but if you are looking for decent functionality and great value, check out Motorola phones. If someone from Motorola sees this, I should get some compensation (maybe another free phone?) for a positive review, call me ;-)"
Just got my brand new moto x. It's so quick so don't have to wait till my favorite apps open.
"Overall, a nice phone except the extremely yellow screen."
One of the best phone in 2014 and still serve me good. Love everything about this phone except for no micro sd slot and limited internal memory (I got the 16GB model).
Great
it's a great phone. this is my second one (i dropped the first one on a tile floor) and i liked it so well i bought one for my wife.
"Bought for Girlfriend after she broke her 5S. She likes it, very good phone. Beautiful screen. Complaints are: No home button, battery could be better, camera doesn't focus very well. Good for the price. Nice stop-gap phone. Will be good for a year or so. Definitely recommend if that's the situation for you."
Love it. Camera works really well and the display is sharp.
"Great phone until I dropped it. Fast, clean, decent price. No bloatware, unless you count some of the moto stuff like the hand motions and the moto version of Siri. Both of which I found useful, especially the shake for flashlight."
Heats too much . Everything else is Perfect
Excellent
"Camera has really hard time on focusing, in the night, it just doesn't work."
"I had a moto x before, and this one has a weird background image, with text, that I can't remove. On the picture attached, I put a white background so that you can see the text I'm talking about. This is definitely a bug. Please advise."
Very good mobile. Condition is very good as a new mobile.
"Great phone, but it was a gift and the receiver wanted to return it. Set up was easy with H20wireless, would have been a good phone."
"Great cel, delivery and information ."
"this is a Nexus, don't let the name fool you. Motorola made their bloody masterpieces in 2014: the Moto X and the Droid Turbo.The X14 is amazing.. just make sure you get the 32 gigabyte version.. the 16 comes with 10 useable gigs =("
Good phone. But the screen cracked on the first fall. Probably weaker of the smartphones out there.
Best phone I had!
I love this phone!
"Pro:EVERYTHING (I had a nexus 5 and it was jut pain with signal and quality. My NEXUS 5 BENT)- Aluminum housing- Fast and Furious- Hanged only 1 time so far in 3 months (mutiple calls, fb, whatsapp, etc)- NEXUS 5 killerCons:- Whoever was the camera engineer should be fired. My 5 year old digi cam takes better quality pictures in DARK.- IN low light camera is like a day without a laugh (USELESS)"
"This phone has exceeded all of my expectations. The screen is wonderful, the battery long lasting. The stock Android experience is a wonderful thing. Want a great phone service experience? Get this phone and pick your own provider. I LOVE IT."
"Own a lg g4,htc m7 & m8,iPhone 5s and now a moto x second gen. Love my moto the best! Customized to me, sharp screen,fast,light,easy to set up from old phone. Buying my wife a moto g!"
"Very good phone, will recomend to anyone"
Is amazing!
Love it. I have a moto G and got this for my mom. It's bigger and better. Only downside is that the power button is super sensitive so it keeps turning on in her pocket.
"Great performance, but battery life could be better. Also where is marshmallow?"
The phone works great! Almost new!!
"Excelent for the prive, good value"
"After about a month after my purchase. The phone is great. i would recommend it to ALMOST everyone. The only downside is that the camera is quite mediocre. The auto focus wont work at times, along with the cameras poor attempt to operate in low lighting. But if you arnt concerned with your phone camera. It is an amazing phone with many unique and useful features."
More than a better condition. Came clean and sweet. I don't mind the small space capacity but I love the phone.
Great phone
very doog
Excellent product. My son uses it all the time
"Fast, sturdy design."
"I am coming from aa note 3 to this and it amazes me how different everything is. I have had a moto g 2014, blu vivo air, iPhone 5s, note3, s2,3,4,5, lg g flex, and the list goes on and on.... Out of all the phones I have had this one is the bestProsFast! (As fast as dropping a stick of butter!)Solid buildAwesome call qualityGood signal strengthFast charge!!!!!Ambient screen!Latest updates!ConsNo upgradeable sd card slot :'-("
for a little while a couple weeks after I first started using it the auto rotate didn't work. I went online and saw it is not uncommon problem. Solution is to whack phone hard against your thigh.Battery life doesn't seem too great.Otherwise it is OK phone
Just loved it..Worth the price...
"Great phone. Comes with all the tools you would ever need and of course there are tons of apps to choose from. Large, sleek, fast and fun."
:)
"So I received the phone yesterday on a deal of the day special of $199 Amazon had this past week and thought ""Wow"" this is such a great deal until I realized it was only in 16gb. I thought really? They still make 16gb phones these days? Why? Well at least it has SD expansion and then realized it didn't. Once again, why not? If your only providing 16gb why not include SD expansion (makes no sense whatsoever).So I hesitated but thought well I can probably live with 16gb since I have cloud storage and a tablet with SD card so I pulled the trigger ($199 is had to pass up). I ordered the black leather edition and upon receiving it and holding it I was very pleased. It's beautiful to look at and hold and very well constructed as others have mentioned. The smell and feel of leather is unsurpassed by any other phone I have used prior (iPhones, Samsungs, LG's) the arched back design also allows for a superior hold in the hand.So all is well I thought, I'm loving it. I turned it on and immediately went to the storage capacity and I was blown away! Only 10.2 GB of available storage!!! What the hell how could this be? There must be some kind of mistake this is ridiculous! I was immediately prompted to update the software to Lollipop which I did and after updating all firmware and the outdated KitKat it came installed with and adding Whatsapp, CBS Sports and Slacker I was left with a repulsive 7.9 GB of available storage, I mean seriously this is a joke!How in the world does a 16gb device take up 6gb for the OS? Perhaps 2gb maybe 3 but 6? And if so why the hell isn't it advertised? Instead of 16gb it should be sold as ""10gb of usable storage"" I would have never purchased it...So yes the phone is pretty to look at and hold and yes the OS is stock android which craps on everything else but the usable storage of the Moto X is not reasonable and therefore I cannot recommend it especially if this is your go to phone and plan on having it for a while. With more apps, a few songs and constant app updates you will run out of storage in no time and your phone will begin to lag.If Moto is going to undercut the storage than at least provide an SD slot. Perhaps go for the 32gb or just get a Nexus. I mean really my LG Optimus G (E970) from 2012 is also 16gb, has a ton of AT&T and LG Bloatware and yet still has 11.8GB leftover of usable storage AND includes SD expansion and that's a 3 year old phone!!!"
New like out of the Factory!!
"This is one of the best smartphones you can buy under $300. I admit that this is not the latest Moto X, but for general purposes of general people, this phone is perfect. Its screen size is just perfect for one-handed use and media consumption, but the phone is not very big. The phone also feels substantial in hand, thanks to its very solid construction. The screen also offers very deep blacks and saturated colors. Only thing mediocre about this phone is the camera. That doesn't mean its got a bad camera, but the camera is just average in an otherwise awesome phone."
Great phone! Only reason why it is 3 stars is there is no expandable sd card slot (1 star) and you can't remove the battery (1 star)
👍
Awesome product. Even better than iPhone.4K video recording is excellent.More friendly...could be ua best friend as mine.Go for it. The whole world will be on your finger tips.:-)
Great item!
I have been looking forward to this phone since I knew my contract was going to be up soon.I got what I ordered! :)
"Great, but I bought it for latin america and seems AT&T has locked the function for the hotspot use on the cellphone. Is this even legal on an unblock cellphone??"
"I was sure it would be a great phone and with great looks. My expectations were high and they were exceeded!It is gorgeous and works extremely well.For my use the battery life is good, I get through the day easily.Coming from a Galaxy Nexus, I didn't opt for the Nexus 6 as it is too big for me, this was the next option. Almost pure Android, with the almost the same Nexus experience.Totally satisfied.Phone came is sealed box, pure version as promised."
"Operating system is impressive. The phone is fast, smooth, and performs as expected. The Moto features are also convenient (Drive, Sleep, Home features are useful and make accessing the phone a breeze). The camera seems fine to me, although I'm not someone who relies on my phone camera to provide professional quality images. The only thing that kept this review from being a 5 star is the battery life. It is not sub-standard by any means, but if with regular, moderate use throughout the day, a full charge will get you about 10 hours of use at most."
"I love this phone! It's fast, responsive, and adapts to your actions. The battery may seem a big issue for some people, but it lasts for at least 24 hours with my moderate usage.The biggest downside in my opinion is the storage capacity of 16 GB, which is actually a net of 10 GB only...and since there are no SD card slots, you will probably be running out of space while migrating your files from your old phone."
So good I'm buying another one
Its more than I expected!!!
Working great
"Good phone , accesible price."
"got phone today, NOT LOLLIPOP"
"Great cellphone!, no problem with the shipping, all included as said! Recommended of course!"
I loved the near stock android experience
"Best phone ever - love the ""talk to me"" feature - I don't even need to touch my phone anymore, it's the best feature ever! I used to love the iPhone, but I'll never go back to an iPhone again - this phone has changed my life for the better."
EXCELLENT
Amazing phone .Total Value for MoneyWay to go Moto
"This is my second Moto. Excellent phone. Quick, Google now is great, very good HD video."
"Got this for my elder son after his Moto G died. It's a great value for the price, with a respectable camera, Lollypop, good battery life, and that gorgeous wooden backplate. Depending on the specs and reviews of the upcoming Nexus 5, I may replace my aging Nexus 5 with one of these."
excellent seller and product
Probably the best smartphone out there. Love the bamboo in the back.. Super fast and really smooth. Colors are awesome and camera is great too..
Good quality phone easy to use.
"Beautiful bamboo back, decent battery life, a bit on the larger side compared to Moto X 2013, great Android experience that is close to vanilla."
Excelent!!
Amazing phone.
"This phone is a piece of crap, I have purchased 2 hoping that the broken headphone jack was just luck, but the jack broke on my second phone immediately after the return warranty was up. If you want to use headphones with this phone EVER. Do not consider buying."
I love it! Everything about this phone is great! Highly recommend if you want a good reliable phone that feels premium and performs great.
ok
Great
One of the biggest mistakes I did is to buy this phone on Amazon. Till date since buying the phone in early July I have not been able to place more than 5% of my calls and still have not received a single call on this phone. All the calls drop each and every time. And when i do receive a call not able to pick it up. The dialler functionality to receive calls is horrible. I tried calling motorolla for help regarding this issue and I was told to do a hard reset on the device which I did but the problem still persists.Shame on Motorolla and Amazon to sell such horrible devices.
Excellent device. Worth the money.
"I did not receive the charger, charger cable, or the sim removal tool along with my phone. The package says it should also include those items. Hopefully I already have the sim card in my phone."
"BEST PHONE I`VE EVER OWNED!The Moto X was a great flagship smartphone in it`s launch date back in 2014, the price at that time was OK, but now with this price cut value is really amazing. When you think about not only the specs but also the software and quality this smartphone has to offer theres no much really any major brand smartphone that catches up to this level.Main pros:PerformanceSpecificationsDesignQualityMoto functionsAmoled 5.2 inch displayCons:Battery doesn`t suck but is not the best in it`s segment. It could offer a bigger a bigger battery considering the thickness of the smartphone.Camera:13 Megapixels seem good but the performance in low lighting aren't satisfying."
"Using phone for a month in extreme conditions, dropped on concrete once with bumper, no problems. Software runs smooth and very intuitive."
"Its been just 3hrs since i used it and this is my first impression.Light UI n Much faster- Switching from Samsung S6 to this made me feel much better. S6 has too much bloatware and without many new apps installed, its RAM Is already 86% used and it gets slow with its touchwiz UI. But Moto X is clean, has little bloatware but not too bad. Still has 1GB+ RAM available.Too good for what i paid for - $299 for this phone?? Its bargain... i feel like i bought Nexus 6 or S6 for $299 and for $65 u cud get the Moto extended warranty too!!! Excellent isn't it?"
"great phone, battery backup is also good."
Great phone. Set-up was easy and fun.It has all of the bells and whistles that a flagship phone should have. The price was reasonable and I got a first rate phone.
"You can pretty much get a feel for this phone from reading the specs. Mine is black with the plastic back which is still kind of grippy. Aesthetically, the phone is sexy. It feels really good to hold and look at. That said, for my taste it feels wider than it is long. Obviously it's not, but it's wider than I'd like it to be, minor thing I guess. The camera's good, not great but definitely not as bad as some reviews make it seem. Obviously it doesn't perform as well in low light, which the iPhone is really the only one that does. But you won't be disappointed with this phone, the few things Motorola adds to the software are actually useful. Battery is okay, I'd say average and could definitely be better. But you should make it through the day."
Would be nice if Amazon sold the 64GB version too.
"Motorola has figured out the right combination of standard and delightful. Standard in that this is a 99% pure Android phone. Delightful in that there are little Moto surprises that don't get in the way of the Android experience. For example, Spotlight Stories sounds kinda cheesy, but it's cute and fun, so well done.The Moto X (2nd gen) is just the right size. Big enough for photos and videos and Chromecast, small enough to fit in phone pockets popular in men's shorts these days. The screen is amazing. Everything is so responsive. I'm sure this will be perfect for me for a couple of years. Amazing that I could get it off-contract for $300.I put an ArmorSuit MilitaryShield on the screen, and a teal Cruzerlite Bugdroid gel case around the back. I really could not be happier!"
"Logical system. Nice feel. Love Droid ops.Still waiting to test it outside USA.Said it was from T-MOBILE line of unlocked phones, but T-Mobile said they don't sell it. Regardless, it's working great."
Excellent phone at a great price.
I just love it!
My phone is not working properly and its not getting signal
The best price and quality
"Ordered through Open Group Wireless and they sent me a XT-1092 model, which doesn't match the description at all! The XT-1092 is the European / Chinese version which doesn't have the correct basebands to do T-Mobile LTE. Beware of buying through Open Group Wireless."
It worked as I was waiting
"Great smartphone. Quality build, nice features. So far so good"
Awesome product. Even better than iPhone.4K video recording is excellent.More friendly...could be ua best friend as mine.Go for it. The whole world will be on your finger tips.:-)
Great item!
"The battery life on this phone, even under load, is pretty impressive when compared to my old Nexus 5. I'm definitely a convert. While Motorola's bundled software seems more gimmicky than a bunch of essential, killer apps, they definitely can be useful at times (Moto Connect is super useful -- I like having the ability to SMS from my laptop)."
"excelent product, just as described, and shipping fast"
"This guy is really weak, a very unfriendly cell phone for clumsy people or 'droppers'. Expect to crack that screen! The rest is just fine."
"Great Phone. Excellent features. Very bright indoors and OK bright outdoors. I love this phone. The music is pumped through only one speaker, but very loud. I can listen to music on my patio as I BBQ with no extra speakers. The phone is sharp too. The backing is leather finish and the rounded styling is beautiful. The voice command feature is super cool. I highly recommend this phone."
Disappoint Very Much
it's just what I expected
"great phone, size just what I was looking for.. Screen fantastic. Thin and light."
Thank you.
Awesome device! It has all you need in a phone!
Excellent
The phone arrived in flawless condition. Appeared brand new!!! This is now officially the BEST phone I've ever owned and the cheapest I've ever paid for one. LOVE IT!!! Would definitely purchase from warehouse deals again.
"Let me preface this by saying that only 1.5 months ago, I really liked Motorola and loved my Moto X. Sadly, I cracked its screen, and even though I could fix it myself (I've done many phone repairs) I paid $130 to send it to Motorola for the original manufacturer parts and repair warranty. I figured I was paying for ease and convenience.I was so wrong.Almost two weeks passed without indication they had received my device. I called in a serious of support specialists before finally being forwarded to the escalation team, who took about 30 minutes to locate my phone, verify it had been received, and assue me that it would be sent back to me within 5 business days.But that wasn't the end.5 days later and no word from Motorola. I called again. Support informed me that, actually, they could not replace my Moto X. 'Replace' is the word they used. But wait - they are supposed to be repairing it, right? Wrong. Apparently they just send you a refurished edition of the same model. So they no longer had my original phone and could not even replace it with the same model.The representative offered me an 'upgrade' to the Nexus 6, which I absolutely HATE. It was way too big for me (I am a woman with small hands) and they are apparently completely unable to provide a Moto X Pure, which is the closest thing to what I have now. Somehow, it's not in stock? How is MOTOROLA, the company who MAKES the Moto X Pure supposed to be 'out of stock'?Anyway, they assured me the Nexus would ship in 5 business days. Here we are, 8 business days later, and STILL nothing. I called in at this point to demand a refund for all the inconvence, which I was informed they ""do not owe me"" because I agreed to receive a Nexus 6. Mind you, I agreed to a replacement for my LOST device - I did NOT agree that the replacement would be satisfactory compensation for all this grief and aggravation.This has been absolutely, by FAR, the worst customer service experience I have ever suffered through. On top of everything described, each representative could barely speak English, was dismissive and rude with me, and clearly barely trained, just reading off a script. I cannot express how enough how disappointed I am given how much I enjoyed the original product.At this point, I am only eager to receive my 'upgrade' to the Nexus 6 in order to promptly sell it, never buy anything Lenovo or Motorola again, and make it my life's mission to make sure everyone else knows how awful this company is, too.In sum, stay away from Motorola; while they make a decent product, should anything go wrong, God forbid, they will not support you and determine instead to make your life miserable."
Phone arrived in good condition. But when I tried to activate it with Verizon they said there was an issue with the IMEI number. The only thing I could do is return it.
"Love it. Mine arrived in an opened box, but otherwise looked untouched."
"Great. Battery life is only 4 stars, performance is good. Nice and light. OK camera. Great speakers"
i sent it back!!!!
OUTSTANDING!!! Top notch service and shipped on time. Great product. Would recommend.
I love it.
Good.
Great phone
"its simply incredible, by far, the best phone i ever had in my life"
All was perfect!
"Excellent! Absolutely new XT1095, very beautiful with bamboo back cover. Powerful, with last Android version."
"Thank you for my smartphone . I am very glad that everything worked very well . Thank you for your prompt delivery and excellent , high-quality goods!"
Well. You told me. I didn't listen. Two days. One feet high... Broken Glass.
"I love the Moto X second Gen for its speedy performance due to it's snapdragon 801, and its amazing display due to its amoled 1080p hd. However no device is perfect and neither is this one, as it lacks a powerful battery, or an amazing camera, but it works and that is not why I gave this product four stars. I gave it four stars due to my products lack of build quality. It was strong but the bamboo was weak and coming off from the bottom. My phone still scratches very easily when putting it in my pocket, I found out it was sand and.... I work in a geotech company.... Besides those two flaws, I love my new phone..."
"Love this phone. Graduated from the Moto G and preciously and iPhone 5 and previously iPhone 4 and 3G. Best phone I've used out of those. Not the highest end specs but phone has a ton of nice but non-overwhelming features. Only minor complant is the Moto Voice doesn't always pick up my voice, but at the bar last night kept cutting on when I never said anything close to my keywords, I've turned that off and went with standard Google now 'OK Google'. 100% RECOMMEND."
Awesome!
"Why is xt1097, instead xt1095"
"excellent seller, arrived quickly and as described, satisfied with my cell"
Good price
Great ítem! Like new
excelent
worst phone ever... bought one had to return right away as the keys were not working.. bought another one after 30 days the menu key doesn't work.. cannot return now or get it fixed.
"This phone replaced my broken nexus 5 and I couldn't be happier. Great package from Motorola. Screen is big enough for my liking and the phone is easy to handle with one hand. I have the black leather back and it feels very premium.In fact, the phone is so good that my wife and my dad ditched their iPhone and Samsungs for it. It just works. My phone is 2 years old and runs like brand new."
I about used to replace the one I had before. I love this phone so much I didn't want to switch it up.
The phone display stopped working in 6 months and I cannot use the phone.
"great phone, it has 2 things that sucks, battery life and camera"
perfect
Battery life and it's difficulty to connect with metro pcs are the biggest and probably only drawbacks to this phone. Works amazingly but will not last an average days use compared to other moto products.
Excellent delivery. Everything great
"I just love it! Its faster, comfortable and have a nice and unic design. It looks slick, with the now-trademark curved back panel."
"I don't normally start with the bad but I will this time.The Cons:The lower speaker grill broke off within the first week even with a cruzerlite case. That is really disappointing.Battery life is inconsistent. Some days are 4+ hours of screen time and other days I struggle to get 2 hours being in the same place with the same signal.The camera is just bad. Poor focus, fuzzy pictures and even worse low light performance. To use the 13MP advertised you must use 4:3 aspect ratio. 16:9 is 9.7MP.The Pros:Beautiful screen. Bright and crisp AMOLED that is just a joy to use.Stock Android with a few light touches that are welcome. The notification light up on the screen is great and doesn't require turning the whole screen on to see what is happening.The moto assistant is overall helpful but sometimes just doesn't listen haha.Conclusion:I wouldn't recommend this phone. Maybe the new 2015 moto X can deliver a better device. There are a lot better options out there that perform much better especially with the camera and battery life."
Very good phone
Perfect
Very high configuration for the price. Nice to have this phone
Like this cellphone!
Awezome!
"Good phone , accesible price."
"got phone today, NOT LOLLIPOP"
All good !
"Amazing cell phone, my daughter like it so much."
"With the Canadian dollar tanking, it ended up costing more than expected...but still awesome phone. Replacing a Nexus4 and seems to excel in every way, especially for the price"
Very good device
Only cons is that it doesn't allow a memory card. But the cell phone is excellent
Nice Phone!! Thanks!!
Love the phone so far...have only had it for a week though.
"Great phone. No problems whatsoever. Camera could be better, but still works great in good lighting."
"""No Verizon SIM card"" message will not go away since this is an unlocked Verizon phone--this is something that the seller did not disclose! Buyer beware..."
"Excellent price, quality and delivery time!"
😀
The screen on this phone is *really* fragile.The performance and battery life are great - I've been quite satisfied by the phone other than this. But it's definitely not up to snuff on durability.I'm going to be replacing mine.
Amazing
"Fast phone. Few scratches because it was used but not noticeable. I have not tested the water proofing yet and don't think I will soon. Other phones look better on paper but I have used a Samsung s6 and this performs better. It doesn't have the lags. Camera is nice too and audio is very loud. Love it. Oh I bought it for my wife but I take every opportunity to ""update and configure it"" just so that I can use it"
"daily use, very powerful nice screen got it on prime deal of the day"
Great phone but it was a t-mobile version that came so sadly i had to return it. it says gsm unlocked but i could not use it with at&t.
"phone has little internal memory, and no way to add more. glass is right to edge of device making it very vulnerable to breaking when dropped. (Found this out the hard way.)"
Screen has an ad for the phone burned in it. Came with knockoff Apple earpods and charger even though the seller said it would come with factory earbuds. Nice phone otherwise.
Great phone. Love it. Best phone I've had so far and I've had something like 35 of them since I used to travel a lot and had to use different phones in other countries.
"Really nice phone overall, camera quality is not very good btw"
"This is great fast phone,but have an issue with dinamics-people couldnt hear me while I am on speacker. Also,when I was using it to talk on a Skype-was really bad hearing. This phone has problem with speakers. All other functions are great."
"Great phone, ultra fast and pure android experience.Instant 5.1 upgrade"
i love everything about this phone. Except when i brought it to Verizon to have it activated they told me it was a locked phone! BOOOOOO!! Not what i ordered!Update: I've since received a new moto and its exactly what II ordered. Thank you amazon!
All right. No problems.
Excellent.
nice
"A exceptional phone, specially because it includes Android almost almost Stock"
All good. Met the expectations.
"works great. great condition, and fast shipping what more could you ask for!"
Great!
"It just works. It is fast and flawless. The screen is just the right size, not to big, not too small. Call quality is great. No complaints about this phone."
Very good phone. Seller also work great!
"Its an AT&T phone which has been unlocked so there will be lot of AT&T apps which cannot be uninstalled. You will be better off buying it off the Motorola Website, not only will you get 1 year warranty on the new phone you can also trade in your phone. The phone is great though, it is sleek, the screen size is perfect, the camera is awesome and the Hello Moto X command feature is very useful."
"This phone is just so great! I had a Moto G prior to this and I loved it and this was just the upgrade to continue my love of the Moto family. The apps are easy to navigate and I really like the assistant feature that figures out my life schedule and adapts based on my usage. The phone is intuitive to a casual or business lifestyle, which is great for me as I can flow in and out of official and personal business."
"It is new and working great. Sharp screen, good battery time."
One of the best buys on a phone!
Working perfectly! a really bargain for the price
A+++
"Great cel, delivery and information ."
"this is a Nexus, don't let the name fool you. Motorola made their bloody masterpieces in 2014: the Moto X and the Droid Turbo.The X14 is amazing.. just make sure you get the 32 gigabyte version.. the 16 comes with 10 useable gigs =("
"Great phone... I thought it works in 4g antennas in LatAm but it doesn't.reagarding performance, it is the greater the quicker as expected. Very good phone."
Love this phone had one just like it and I accidentally sat on it so I bought a new one just like it love the bamboo cover wish the screen was larger but the phone is great
"So far so good. I like it. The only thing that caused a little problem is I had to order a ""nano"" SIM card. I was not able to simply take my old SIM card out and insert it in the new phone. I will try and update several months from now..."
The product was everything that I expected from the description. The phone works great and very pleased with the speed of delivery.
"excellent phone, very good price and quality. Four good"
very true to description. Got to say I am pleased so far.
"This phone breaks easily. There's a reason they stopped selling it. Not to mention the description didn't say that ""unlocked"" does NOT mean ""Verizon compatible"". I wasted my money on a rubbish phone that I couldn't use."
Received it quickly works as well as the phone it replaced.
"I previously owned a brand new MotoX 1st Generation which I had a love/hate relationship with. I hated the fact it would not hold a charge so it was spending more time on the charger than your average phone. Then one day the chip fell out the charging port so within a year I needed another phone. Since new was not that great I decided I would go for a used MotoX & purchased this one. I love this phone. Its bigger than the 1st Generation, it holds a charge & is totally compatible with AT&T. All I had to do was switch over the SIMS from the old phone to the new phone. It was a simple process with a convenient little tool that was included & was easy to do. Never had to contact the service provider. I love easy...Any phone I have ever ordered on Amazon , no matter who the seller was, had been received quickly & was exactly as it had been described."
"I am so disappointed. It has been less than six months and this phone has completely stopped functioning. It gets super hot when charged, loses its battery within an hour, and no longer charges 90% of the time.This is the first negative review I have ever written. I am BEYOND disappointed."
"Phone I received is XT1097 which I think is ATT and locked, can not upgrade beyond 5.1."
Phone works great and actually got an update to marshmallow. I particularly like the form factor as it is similar to the nexus 4/5 as opposed to the phablets we are seeing so much of these days.
"Love it but poor battery life. I'm not a heavy user but at the end of the day i've got less than 25%.Also, now (less than a year from new!) it won't charge from the wall outlet. Only directly from a computer or portable battery."
"This phone has everything you could possibly want in a cell phone and more. Fast processors, the Moto app that takes note of your driving and announces incoming calls and texts, allowing a truly hands free experience. I heartily recommend giving this phone serious consideration should you be looking for an unlocked device."
"Even in 2016, this is a great phone. I bought it for $199, making it an especially good deal. Internally, this phone packs a 2.5 GHz Snapdragon 801 processor. Applications open quickly, and there is no lag within the phone. The AMOLED screen produces vibrant colors, albeit a little over saturated. With the Adreno 330 GPU, gaming is smooth. The FHD display is more than adequate for the 5.2"" screen, and I believe that using a WQHD screen would be pointless. The visuals are crystal clear. The phone does not have stereo speakers despite its appearance, but the sound quality is still extremely loud and clear. The matte black finish is quite smooth, soft, and pleasant to hold.As a Motorola phone, this phone should receive quick updates to the newest version of android extremely quickly. Furthermore, the operating system is not full of bloatware that Samsung and LG install with the phone, but rather a few apps that allow for hands-free gestures and other shortcuts. These apps can be easily disabled at the users discretion, but I find them extremely useful.One thing that should be pointed out it that this phone DOES NOT have full support for T-Mobile's network. You will be able to text, call, and browse online, but the data speed and coverage will not be optimal."
"The blend of Bamboo with thin aluminium bezel and those ergonomically designed responsive buttons makes this device unique than anymore android device out there in the market. Upgraded to Android Marshmallow 6.0, nothing could be more satisfying than this. The rear Motorola dimple is much nicer to hold than other dimples in Moto lineup."
"Great smartphone overall! The screen is gorgeous, Motorola's software is extremely useful (My most used phrase these days must be ""OK Moto X""), and the otherwise Stock Android plus the powerful (even if aging) processor make for the fastest and smoothest Android experience I've ever had. The build and design is excellent, although I would recommend a case to protect that glass front, as many people allegedly broke their Moto X screen on the first drop. The camera is not perfect, but in good lighting conditions it can take excellent pictures. Fast Android updates are also a very good thing about the Moto X.So, overall, a great smartphone that offers a lot of value for its price."
"THE GOOD The Motorola Moto X has a sharp 1080p screen, a swift quad-core processor, nifty software and gesture features, and customizable design options that'll fit anyone's style.THE BAD A minimalist camera, combined with no expandable memory, are the handset's only drawbacks.THE BOTTOM LINE The Motorola Moto X hits all the right notes, delivering stock Android inside a powerful high-end handset that you can customize yourself."
"This was one of the top smartphones in 2014, but newer models have been released since then. Performance is still more than adequate for most people. This unlocked version did receive the Android 6.0 (marshmallow) upgrade. We got the upgrade over-the-air in January 2016. Reportedly, locked version of this phone will not be getting the upgrade. If you're looking for a cheaper unlocked Android phone and can live with the paltry 16GB of memory, this is a great choice. Price was $200 when I bought it here. 16GB may be fine if you mostly use the cloud to store music, video, and photos. If you're a hoarder, look for a 64GB phone instead."
"This is a good phone, but know its limitations and your usages. I know at this point I am speaking to people looking for a slightly ""old,"" < $200 phone. You could do worse than the Moto X. This is optimized for phone use; this 16gb item is not a proxy tablet or a hand-held entertainment center. The ""feel"" is high-end in the phone's weight/balance, materials, and rigidity. The software is nice. As many reviews point out, this is basically a no-BS, stock, android with a very few and almost always clever and useful accessories (like a minimalist, motion sensitive lockscreen; a twist-to-activate camera; and Motorola-tweak for using OK Google to operate the phone, make calls, etc.). It has one front-facing speaker, which I think is smart. It has the best speaker-sound I have ever heard in a phone; great for speaker-phone use. (Oddly, the conventional receiver speaker may be below average, or just not volume-optimized; it is weak at max volume, even). The phone's drawbacks are a) it has no SD card, and Marshmallow [the OS] takes up 6gb of the hard drive. This means that if you have a few apps on the phone that are sizable, you will likely store photos or music on a cloud or micro SD stick. That doesn't sound onerous, but it could be, and most apps will not read directly, except in very limited ways, from an accessory card or cloud. You would need to move files onto the native drive, and then move them back to conserve space, etc. and: b) The camera is fine in broad daylight--but only in broad, blazing daylight or super-close flashes of still-life circumstances. People are not nit-pickling when they criticize this camera. Under the best of circumstances, it composes images of Georges Seurat-like impressionist blobs. Indoor photography is hit-or-miss, and usually a miss; the Moto X camera struggles to focus or attain light balance and surprisingly the camera takes almost no advantages of flash (?!) to correct its low-light, indoor difficulties; one indoor shot out of four will look ""pretty good"" but I can do nothing to control this outcome. But if you only take close-up flash shots or outside sunshine shots, it is still functional and acceptable. I tried using other camera software, and the original equipment software seems best. The Moto locks down ISO and exposure time settings, in any case, so that no software can control those features (my old LG-G2, which sadly developed crazy-screen syndrome, allowed these adjustments from the start). I like the saturated colors on the screen--on a bigger screen (tablet or bigger), I likely wouldn't, but this painterly, color-popping screen is an audacious detail to put on the phone. I think it's cool, but one dubious benefit of the saturated screen is that it makes the camera's sketchy work seem much better than it will on a large, normally saturated and balanced screen. Bottom line: great feeling, great looking, minimalist phone; reasonably fast processor. Don't get the 16gb model if you have many music or image files to store: no SD card. The camera is weak."
Phone was advertised as unlocked but came locked to Verizon. Had to call and get that taken care of before it could be used.
"Everything from the packaging to the phone was just amazing. I got it when it said that it was going to be back in stock at a later sate bbut then the shipping was bumped up to the same week so don't be afraid of the in stock later date.The phone is amazing. Depending on your internet speed, it will take a while for the four updates to take places; it goes from Kitkat, to the latest Lollipop and Marshmallow is expected soon.Apart from that, everything is great from the screen (super bright and vibrant) to the performance (which is impeccable for the price - I got 44000 on Antutu after downloading some apps. It got 30 - 50 FPS in the game region which is great. The phone is just really fast and can compete with the big flagship phones) to the gameplay (which is very fluid with no lag issues on arcade games, haven't tried frame intensive games) to the camera (absolutely amazing especially in apps like Instagram and Snapchat) to the microphones (I could talk to it from a good few feet away in the ideal conditions). The only thing is no SD card slot but everything else is great. Not to mention the cool Moto features and NFC support.3 days updateThe phone is still holding beautifully.It better than ever with around 5GB left in storage (after downloading a lot of games and social media apps). Just monitor your storage so you don't use it up all at once. But as it is, the phone is functioning beautifully and it working like a charm.It still doesn't lag and functions beautifully and the more graphic intensive games like FIFA 15 and easily handles games like Crossy Road with ease. Day to day tasks are even smoother with no stuttering, just fluid actions from opening apps to using them for long periods of time to jumping from one to another; the RAM is holding up spectacularly.I would highly recommend getting a quick charger with it so you can keep it charged. You'll need it if you use your phone alot.All the Moto Actions still work and as time passes, the phone gets to know you better so it appears to work better over time (just make sure all the apps are up to date).Just a really great phone overall. If I had a Micro SD card slot, there'd be nothing stopping it but it does support USB OTG (so to some measure, the phone is perfect)."
works fine............ I don't find GPS
"I bought it for my daughter. She loves the clear display and the OS. She wishes that it supported additional SD memory card. That was her only complaint. The size is good (not too big, not too small). She loves the bamboo feels. Samsung and Apple get most of the media attention when it comes to smartphones, but if you are looking for decent functionality and great value, check out Motorola phones. If someone from Motorola sees this, I should get some compensation (maybe another free phone?) for a positive review, call me ;-)"
Just got my brand new moto x. It's so quick so don't have to wait till my favorite apps open.
"Overall, a nice phone except the extremely yellow screen."
One of the best phone in 2014 and still serve me good. Love everything about this phone except for no micro sd slot and limited internal memory (I got the 16GB model).
Great
Excellent
Great phone
Good!
"Quicker than the 1st generation, camera is very nice, I would have wanted 32 Gb instead of 16 Gb of memory but its OK. As I bought an unlocked version, it worked perfect in any country and cell phone company. It only required a full initial charge and started to work normally. Simply perfect!"
Nice Phone
"Arrived Perfectley! as it is described on the publication. The only thing is the wood cover, as nice as it is,,tends to get of when your hand sweats"
"There are thousands of reviews out there, so having switched from an iPhone 5 I will put the most significant differences I have experienced in my review:- No local account: I have the usual cloud email accounts, a business exchange account and my own personal information stored in MS Outlook. With the iPhone I was able to sync my Outlook contacts, calendar, notes, and tasks directly to the iPhone's ""local storage"" but this version of Android forced me to sycn with one of the accounts connected to an email service. I opted to go with my Exchange account rather than G-Mail or Outlook, but I would have preferred to have it all locally stored and synced directly from Outlook rather than through a 3-rd party.- Headsets: I make heavy usage of a 3-button headset. The Moto X does not natively play well with it. I am still trying out various headset controller apps, but it should not be this annoying: Sometimes moto voice and/or ""OK, Google"" will not work, Google Play Music continuously launches on its own, I cannot hang up or pick up calls from the headset buttons, volume does not work equally in all applications, etc.- Message display: Given that this might be just me whining about changes, but I drive a lot and preferred the iPhone temporarily displaying the entire message or email header on the phone screen rather than the ""battery'saving"" icon. I still have not fond a way of making it display entirely as I want. - Love the Moto assist features. Siri is a deaf, dumb and blind simpleton when it comes to voice recognition and helpfulness. I would have been happy even if I had gotten rid of Siri's ""just to confirm, you would..."", but the Moto voice recognition is getting so seamless that I now find myself talking to it as if it was a secretary, setting alarm clocks, making calendar appointments, texting people, etc.- Miss Facetime... Even with family and acquaintances I have had a hard time getting them to go with Google Hangouts. There is always Skype, but Facetime is being missed.Overall, I believe once I get past my ""the iPhone used to..."" phase I will be extremely happy with this phone and OS."
Brilliant boice control

Good purchase experience and very good product so far.
"This is the smartest phone you're going to get in the market ... But like any other smartphone it is not perfect ... Do not misunderstand me I love my MOTO X and I can't be happier with my purchase but has its flaws .. One is the camera is not the best in the market but meets the basic functions ... Second, battery may not reach the full day but with the MOTOROLA turbocharger you have not to worry about it. It is the best phone-price you're gonna find out there."

Look new set up was easy
The screen was not glued correctly and popped out by itself.
"Good price, Sim card tray was accidentally not included. Company quickly shipped the tray. IT works as advertised."
The product was perfect.
"I can not really say much about the functionality. However, either the product title and description need to be corrected or the seller (EStock) that I bought it from sells incorrect product. No-contract and unlocked are 2 different things. It is Verizon only model!"
came with like 5gb and a broken headphone jack but at least it came thanks.
Is a very good phone.
"I recently received the phone almost a week from now, and it's been fantastic. When I was looking into this phone I got nervous to order it because of all the bad reviews, but I took a chance and so far it's been great! The phone had no scratches, the phone almost looked brand-new. A lot of the reviews kept saying that the phone isn't unlocked . So quickly I got nervous when I inserted my simple mobile sim chip especially when the phone said ""not a Verizon sim"" but to double check I used my house phone to call my simple mobile number and surprisingly enough it worked. I love everything about this phone but the only downside about this phone is the battery . When I use the phone too long it overheats and the battery life quickly lowers..sometimes using the battery saving mode helps but at time I get really annoyed when the phone starts to warm up.But either way it was worth it."
Didn't know it was a Verizon full of Verizon bloatware.
"Great phone, I ordered this one for the amazing wood backing."
"Phone description is completely wrong, this phone is NOT unlocked, nor is it GSM, it is a CDMA phone and requires a Verizon sim to work, the phone it self looked to be in good condition, and I can't comment on how well this one would function due to not going past the ""Verizon Sim"" required screen on start up, I previously had a Moto X and they are amazing! Hopefully after a few more orders I will find one that is TRUE to its posting"
Its not unlocked!!!! I cant use it. I paid a cell phone that I cant use it!!
"Even with no SD card,, phone is great,,works perfect for me,,fast and easy to work with"
perfect phone I love it.
Works fine.
Phone was in good condition so 1 star. Phone was not unlocked. Would have to get a jailbreak to use it which is a another trip to someone who could do that and also cost me more money. Also arrived late.
I got two both work great on Cricket.
"A good, first smart phone for my wife. Enough power to run the few apps she will use, and slim enough to hold comfortably."
"This phone is beautiful. I love the wood back! its very diff from any phone I've ever owned before. Also, it has a lot of really cool features such as the find me feature. I quite frequently lose my phones, and the find me feature on this phone has found my phone a few times already."
Nice smartphone!
Do not buy this phone unless you use verizon. Phone is not unlocked as they say that it is.
"Best cellphone, did not like battery charger that came with it...not original one"
Misunderstanding.
I bought a smart phone unlocked like the item main description and the cell phone is locked by Verizon and also i miss the key to open the SIM slot.I hope you let me know.
arrived and worked as advertised...
"EXCELLENT PRODUCT...! (ONE CHARGER DIDN""T WORK) CAN YOU SEND ME ONE...???"
"Beautiful phone. I'm convinced that MOTO X is the best phone! I had the 1st Gen and though this wasn't the one I wanted (I wanted the newest one), but due to the sudden death of my phone, I needed something quickly and the price was right! The main problem for me, is space. I need more, but if you use limited apps, you too will love it. The shaking the wrist to get your camera up is great!"
Excellent telephones!!!!!
"THIS PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED NOR GSM!!! Got this phone expecting unlovked, well it was not. Starts up Verizon and when I inserted my at&t sim card, start up screen said you must insert Verizon sim. DO NOT BUY, FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!"
Everything went ok. I recomend thus seller for sure!
I received a locked Verizon phone. Advertised as GSM/CDMA factory unlocked.
LOVE MY PHONE ITS NOT LIKE EVERYONE ELSES
ok
"Works good, nice phone"
"Phone is like new and works perfectly. Migrated from Moto X 1st Gen using Motorola Migrate tool which worked perfectly. The back of the phone of textured instead of slick plastic which is a plus. The only problem is that the charger included does not charge the phone. I have the charger from the old Moto X, so no big deal. But I will check with seller anyway. Very satisfied."
the phone I recieved was new not refurbished.
Disappointed it was NOT the unlocked version as advertised. It is the Verizon version which means NO Android Marshmallow update. The phone was in very good condition though
I bought this cellphone and it wasn't unlocked. I pay a hnoe that doesnt work!!
"I ordered this phone as it was only $30 more than a screen replacement (I dropped my old Moto X 2ng gen). This was the right choice, a solid phone if you're looking for a cheaper option than upgrading to the newest phone available.Some observations from other reviews:- I'm on Verizon, swapping the SIM card and switching phones on-line was quick and painless. New phone works great.- Was delivered with Android Lollipop 5.1 installed. Ran system upgrade (on wifi) twice, I believe gets to 5.1.1 and applies a security patch. This is up-to-date for this phone model.- After upgrade had 9.45GB available.- Phone was NOT unlocked. However, you can officially unlock your phone through Motorola, just requires some extra work."
Excellent .. is almost new. works fine. !!
"Phone was STOLEN, Verizon said it was a blacklisted stolen MEID number. Pathetic."
it wasnt unblocked!!!
"My son loves this phone. Wr upgraded from a moto g to this 2nd generation moto x and he screamed ""thank you mom!"". This phone does a lot more and is bigger than his old phone. Motorola is a very good brand."

came with like 5gb and a broken headphone jack but at least it came thanks.
Is a very good phone.
"I recently received the phone almost a week from now, and it's been fantastic.

The phone had no scratches, the phone almost looked brand-new. A lot of the reviews kept saying that the phone isn't unlocked . So quickly I got nervous when I inserted my simple mobile sim chip especially when the phone said ""not a Verizon sim"" but to double check I used my house phone to call my simple mobile number and surprisingly enough it worked.

"Bricked within one week of owning it. I was driving to a work assignment, using Google Maps to get me there. About 3/4 of the way there, system froze completely, and would not respond to any commands, or any soft or hard reset attempts as indicated by Motorola support, who then said to ship it back for replacement. Of course, the replacement would have been a refurbished model, and not a new one, so I returned it through Amazon and got my money back."
It's a magnific phone but no is a Developer Edition...
"really good phone for the prize only thing is that it did not have the developer edition branding and im still waiting for my lollipop update, the phones camara is not the best but, but it will get the job done in same environment when the lite is good, the screen is a 720p display for a 4,7in display is not bad at all, it has the x8 mobile computing system and two gb of ram 4 core are the main processing unite, two for the graphics and the other two for active display that gives you ""notification without waking up the phone which is really help full. battery life is excellent, great or okay depending on the usage i have gotten 12-18 hours of battery life and 3 hours and 50min of screen on time which is really good if you ask me great buy for a person looking for a goos phone that does not hit the bank a lot, good value for what you paying for ."
"I bought this phone unlocked and out of contract, and it's been good for the amount I paid. I do wish the screen was a little larger and Motorola would update to Android 5.0 but I will probably move on to something else by that time anyway."
Great phone for the price. Only problem is the camera but I knew this before I bought it. The hands free mode is the best thing about it. It's one of those things that you don't know you need until you have it.
"This phone is perfect for me, after searching a lot with an adjusted price range. Because my lifestyle is pretty crazy, I go from college to party to boy scouts to workshops, and then home. I needed a phone which battery lasted me all day listening music, chatting, and keeping track of social media, I really needed a strong device that could hold up my abussive ussage.It gets up to 4G lTE (Just tried it out in the US and Mexico) and it has 26 GB of available storage, which is great for me because I don't have much games, I just have tons of apps and Gbs and Gbs of music, but I've only ocuppied 13GBs of it. Even though the 2nd gen of the moto x is out and the past one is getting quite old, if its this developer edition, its totally worth it (2015). I haven't experienced any lag, ANY of it, it's just amazing how smooth everything runs though Im a very heavy user. The developer options (Not going too far in the phone's configuration, just something you can quickly turn on and off on settings) are very very useful to customize the device.What I found as a fake issue was that the color was just black/woven (Black and White) But it actually looks nice by itself.I recommend 2 cases for this phone:Griffin Reveal case/ 25$ : http://www.amazon.com/Reveal-Protective-Case-Blue-Motorola/dp/B00ESN7MH4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1425066960&sr=8-2&keywords=griffin+case+moto+xOtterbox deffender series for moto x/ 17$: http://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-Defender-Case-Motorola-Moto/dp/B00EUSMOFM/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1425067051&sr=8-3&keywords=otterbox+defender+moto+xBoth in blue look very nice along with black/woven of the phone"
It arrived ok. I really like the cellphone. Thanks!
"My 12 year old son loves it and this was a replacement for his iPhone 4S that took a spin through the washing cycle! The Motorola overlay on Android adds a couple of cool features and this phone is better than my own Nexus 4 that I have been using for the last 2 years. However, he does have a lot of notifications and not sure if this is entirely due to that, but overnight without any use, it seems to lose a lot of power (100% charged at 9 pm routinely is 80% at 7 am in the morning). Need to figure out if this can be fixed."
"Excellent phone even though it's now a bit dated. Only drawbacks are lack of microSD card, and the battery life though decent, could be longer."
"Excellent, worked perfect here in my country (Argentina), totally unlocked and new!"
"Oh my God, this Smartphone is just AMAZING, I'm from Venezuela, and works perfectly with Movistar, Digitel and Movilnet. I have no complains about this Moto X, just buy this phone ppl xD"
This phone is really awesome... Under 300$ unlocked!!! You just can't beat that with the specs it has. Also its a developer edition so you can do all the tinkering you want if your into stuff like that like me. Easy bootloader unlocking. Overall I'm happy with my purchase..
"The phone I received was not a developer edition, and it seems as if the battery may have bulged, as the case is separating along volume/power buttons. The phone it self should be great, I've used and worked with one before, but the experience with this purchase has been awful. Planning on returning the product today."
"The x 2013 should.d not even be on my list. Moto has no support in my country and is not even sold as a grey import. Besides the asking price is very high in comparison to competition. Then I learned of this new pricing so i managed to get a hold of one 32 developer edition moto x. I bought it based on reviews without ever seeing one in the flesh. And I was not disappointed. The reviews were spot on. The phone good side includes design, screen, speed, ease of holdin and, acceptable battery life. The bad side are the speakers ad the camera esp. At low light levels. For the price this is bargain but the story doesn't end here. Most android devices are clones of each other. Depending on what u spend u get a mixture of specs and a altered version of android. Moto offered stock android, put in a few very clever apps of its own so that updates are available faster than the rest. And it managed to use hidden potential of the OS. That is the touch less control. It does really work and it makes everyone else envious. Active display is also nice and it strikes me how it took so long for someone to think of it. Bottom line if this is your price range no need to look further. U.ll be surprised. Did I mention Spotlight. Trust me this phone will make Samsung's and iPhone worthless."
"Basically a great phone. Good battery life (30 hours with normal use). 2GB of RAM means once you open something you can swith back and forth between other applications without any lag. I love AMOLED displays and in turn ""active notifications"" as well. I disabled the voice recognition as I don't plan to use it, to increase battery life. 4,7 is the perfect screen size for me. The speaker is OK, although not great for music, but that's not the purpose of a speaker on a phone. Feels snappy all-around, and got the bootloader unlocked and the phone rooted 30 minutes after opening the box, to get rid of the really few bloatware apps that came pre-installed (2 or 3 at most).It came in it's sealed box with everything in it (earphones not included). All in all, a fantastic phone for the price, and more than enough for 90% of the people out there."
"I had a 16GB Moto X, and was tired of running out of space, which is the worst part about these phones, not having a slot for an SD card. That and not being able to remove the battery, but I love the quality of the phone so much, and for the price, I decided to get myself a 32GB and give the 16GB to my daughter."
just as advertised
It was everything I expected.
THANK YOU..
"Previously had a Nexus 4, the Moto X outperforms it and is one of the better phones I've owned in recent years."
great phone.good price
"Excellent phone. Good graphics and overall performance. ""OK google now"" feature works reasonably (although starts accidentally sometimes)Camera is good. Better than competition. Don't compare it with iPhone or likes though.Phone comes with 50 gigabytes of additional storage on google drive (you have to register for it) is rather useful.The only downside is battery life. as most features require Internet now a days it's strains the battery.Default SMS application does not have ""Return"" key. But that can be solved by alternate application.Note that the phone did not come with headphones."
"Make buying the version ""Developer Edition"" and I received a device which has no sign of that version on the back part respectively.Although I guess it was a mistake, I think the device is a great acquisition."
Love this phone!!!
"Great deal for a stellar performing phone. Thoughtful additions only by Motorola, the remainder of the OS is vanilla Android. Don't let the fact that it's a dual-core CPU configuration dissuade you, this phone has plenty of horsepower to keep it smooth and snappy. If not familiar with the phone's features, just go look at some video reviews of ""Moto X 2013"" and you'll get a better understanding than I could write in text. Perfect size, perfect ergonomics, great performance, and features that you will actually use make this phone a bargain that in my opinion is a better option than the current flagships."
Excellent!!!!
"Smooth, fast, and comfortable. No problems running on TMobile 4G LTE. I was convinced to purchase this phone from the excellent review by Marques Brownlee's channel on Youtube. Even compared to the new flagships out now, everything he sad about this phone is still true now: it has midrange hardware specs, but the X8 setup is so insanely efficient you won't miss out on anything this year's flagship phones have to offer."
Me gusta. I'm coming off of a Nexus 4 and didn't want a phone with too much bloat. This one is excellent and works when I travel over seas
As promised. Nice phone.
"I've owned the Moto X 1st gen (2013) ""Developers Edition"" for a month. It has been my sole phone and has had a lot of use. The following is my review of the performance of the Moto X over that period.The Good:This phone is extremely ""snappy"". It moves from screen to screen and app to app very fast. Lag time is minimal. While officially the Moto X is a dual core phone, it feels more like a quad-core. This is due in part to Motorola adding additional processors that focus on things like graphics and voice controls, eight processors in total. The additional processors only kick in when needed so battery life is maintained without compromising your experience. The performance is also reasonably strong at multi-tasking with multiple apps running at once. I've had ""Netflix"" casting a show while playing ""Temple Run 2"" at the same time, no problem. If you are concerned about the ""specs"" and it only having a dual-core processor, don't be. The design of the processors gives you all the performance you need at the tips of your fingers.The single greatest feature of this phone is the notification display. The amoled screen allows the phone to only turn on the pixels it needs. So instead of a little notification light, the screen displays the time and an icon of the program sending you the notification (email, text, Facebook, Twitter, CNN, Yahoo, etc.) All of this is very customizable to the apps you prefer to receive notifications from. In addition, the phone will display the time and notification icon when you move. So if you take the phone out of your pocket, you immediately get a quick glimpse of what is going on. When I first saw this feature I wasn't sure if I would use it that much. Now I think it's a feature every phone should have.Motorola and Google have done a great job of integrating their products. Driving directions from Google Maps figures out where you work and live and has you morning commute ready to go when you get in the car. The Moto X knows when you are driving and automatically switches to hands free voice controls. Using Google Now and the Moto X dedicated voice processor, you can give commands to the phone without touching a single button. Expect to have lots of Google apps cause they work so well with the Moto X.The Bad:The camera is the one part of the phone that is lacking. I heard this from reviews before I ever bought the phone and they were right. The pictures appear ""grainy"" and seem to lack some bright colors. The camera is passable for lite photo users, but heavy users will need to look elsewhere. Buying a smart phone comes with trade-offs, and the Moto X camera is the trade off here.The Ugly:Two weeks into owning the phone I began experiencing massive battery drain. I googled the problem and there is a temporary fix that can be employed from the boot menu. Unfortunately the problem came back two weeks later. I went to the Motorola site to find an answer and they gave the same temporary patch I found on other sites. A 2013 phone with such a major flaw should have been fixed by the manufacturer by now. The problem comes up in web searches a lot so I have to think this is happening to a number of Moto X users.Conclusion:I would have a hard time recommending this phone to people knowing they could experience the same battery drain problem I have. Believe me, I wish I could recommend it to friends who are looking for a powerful phone for less than $300. But until the battery drain is fixed I will not be able to spread the word about the Moto X."
"I had been making do with cheap not-so-smart phones for many years, enduring all kinds of ridicule from my tech savvy kids. When my most recent semi-smart phone started getting flakier and flakier I decided, OK, it's time to get a real smartphone.This phone came highly recommended even though it is not the current edition. I don't have to have the latest and greatest, and in fact I've saved a lot of money buying last year's model of several high tech gizmos, so I had no trouble buying this.It works like a champ. T-Mobile cut my old SIM card down and installed it and away I went. I must say, it's nice not to hear the sounds of my kids laughing when I complain about my old cheap phone any more. :)"
Im from Argentina... My sister brought me the phone from usa an it works exelent ! great seller and product!
the best móvil phone
Love the phone. It may not be the most epic powerhouse phone around but it fit my no contract budget and is a billion times better than my last phone. Snappy touch and swipe responses. Nice clean bright screen. Camera is ok but not winning any photo contests.
"I want to love this phone. I really do. The only thing is that I was sent the Verizon model, which I can't use in my country. I researched it properly and I needed the model XT1053. I was sent the Verizon model which is XT1060. Not sure how I will be able to return the phone. It really is a great little phone, its just that you have to make sure its the right model.Edit: Thought I would add a photo for reference."
"So many features, so easy to use!!"
"Been a couple of months since I switched to this phone - everything works fine. I'm not a power user. I still need to charge it everyday so that's a bit disappointing in terms of battery life. Also, it takes a couple of seconds to load the contacts when I try to access all contacts, but that's only a slight annoyance. Overall I'm happy with the phone and for the price."
Everything perfect!
Everything is perfect.
"This phone is excellent for me. It has enough internal memory to download all the apps I could ever want or need. There is no SD slot, but it is not needed nor did I require it when looking for a phone. There is more than enough memory to add any music or videos, although most music I use is streamed through apps. For those concerned about an SD slot, then don't get this phone. Most new phone will dispose of the SD slot. The camera on this phone is great, not the best but it does the job. This phone features Motorola gestures that really stand out from the rest of the crowd. The screen is OLED, that's right OLED! That my friend is the future. They are also pushing the latest update onto this phone.I gave this phone one star because of the battery life, but I'm pretty sure it is standard for most phones these days, my previous phone could go days without being charged but it also lacked sufficient internal memory, so you win some you lose some."
Excellent
Excelente producto!!!!
Excelent
Very nice!Works as advertised...all is good so farLooks good too
Product received as described on the website
"great phone. got two day shipping with amazon prime and it got here the next day. doesn't have all of that bloatware and unnecessary apps so you can personalize your phone with all the apps you want without all of the useless apps that carriers love to put on their phones. doesn't lag when scrolling through content on the google chrome browser. it does update to kitkat but there's no release date for the lollipop update for this phone yet. with constant use the battery will run down to about 30-35% in about 7.5-8 hours but i'm not heavy on my phone usage. on standby time i went almost two days without charging the phone. the only issue people may have is with the camera. the pictures you take will either be a hit or miss with the camera app already installed. there are apps you can download such as the google camera app, a better camera, camera fv-5, or hd camera to take better pictures and facetune and afterlight for picture editing. it's just as good as the moto x 2nd generation for a pretty cheap price. i have at&t and had a micro sim card with my last phone so if you need a nano sim card you can just go to a retail store and they'll set you up with a new one. if i remember i'll try to edit my initial review in a few months."
"Battery life isn't quite what I hoped it would be coming from a Moto G (if they just doubled the RAM on that thing and charged $20 more dollars or whatever for it - then it would be the perfect phone).Moto X's hands free and AMOLED UI features are pretty damn cool. Those features are the hook for the Moto X, and I've come to find that they really do improve my relationship with my phone.Beyond that I appreciate the stripped down stock-ish Android experience. I do think it's odd that developer tools weren't on by default even though this is the developer edition of the phone.Hopefully 2day battery life becomes and industry standard and we can get a next generation phone with Moto X software and amazing battery life at the same time."
The phone is great and amazon service is flawless
"I am loving this phone. I wanted to switch network providers from Verizon to Cricket and so was in the market for a GSM unlocked phone. After a lot of research, I switched from my Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini to this phone and I am very pleased. The phone came in its original case and is definitely a brand new phone and not refurbished. Android 4.4.4 downloaded as soon as I booted the phone and set up was super easy through Motorola Migrate. Though some of my contacts did get a bit messed up and some of my apps did not migrate. I love the fact it's a relatively small phone so it fits in my pocket and I can use it with one hand. the interface is also really nice and, this being he developer edition, comes without all the clutter."
"I bought 2 phones, User interface is awesome, very nice phones, they are perfect for what I need, One thing I love the most is the size, not too small no too big"
"I loved it, but returned it right away to get the bigger Moto X 2014. Amazon has the absolute best return policy."
Speakers will randomly crackle for absolutely no reason. Even when the phone is not being used it will randomly start making noise like it is trying to play sound but he speaker wires are loose.When they are not crackling phone works great.Three stars because I shouldn't have to turn the phone off every time I enter a library or classroom. (Can't just put it on silent or airlane mode. Will still act up for no reason)
"I'd like to be clear that this is about the product itself and not the seller - the seller was fine. they provided the item in a timely manner, the phone functions, etc.The issue is motorola's support for the device. there's a bug they introduced to the device after my wife bought it that causes video to fully lock up. Typically after 2-3 videos on Youtube the phone won't play videos without a reboot or cache purge. One of the reasons we bought a motorola device is, aside from Nexus devices, they were supposed to get the most prompt updates and security fixes. After the Lenovo purchase the quality and quantity of the software updates has seriously declined. So, my wife has a $300 device that she can't reliably do one of the things we BOUGHT the device to do - watch videos.Until a software update gets issued to fix the issue, I'm rating the phone a one star. it's been a bug for going on 5 months now. possibly longer."
At last no more carrier bloatware. Hooray for unlocked phones.
"It was perfect, product delivered on time, goo quality and service, and great price!!"
Love it.
"I love this phone. It's my best phone yet. I'm glad I got this unlocked version, which I use with T-Mobile. It came as a ""clean"" Android device without apps you don't want or need. It came with KitKat and was automatically updated to Lollipop with no hassles or delays from the carrier. There is now a newer edition of this phone at a higher price. However, this original edition, if still available, is truly a bargain for such a great smart phone. It takes great photos too. Wish it had WiFi calling from T-mobile."
Battery died in only 1 year!
"The telephone arrived in perfect conditions and with all its original components. However, it restarts by its own – usually- 3 to 4 times every day; and I don't know how to solve this problem which REALLY annoys me. Additionally, I was recharged with an extra 10% over the purchasing price without any previous notice (I noticed this when checking the credit card statement. Though I contacted Visa for fixing this, they told me they had nothing to with this charge)."
"I love this phone. Great size, is very fast and a nice resolution"
"Well we worried about buying a cell phone off of Amazon.. SO many seem to be listed as ""new"" but seem to actually refurbished or worse. Many are listed as unlocked but have all kinds of ATT or other company bloatware on them, again according to the reviews - it seems like its hit or miss. I am thrilled we found this phone. Its the real deal. Really new... wrapped in plastic, never opened never used. It really is unlocked, just got a free nano card off of Consumer Cellular (or any cheapie GSM provider - like straight talk, etc), slid it in and we are good to go. We were looking at many phones LG G3, Apple phones, Google Nexus, etc. 14 y.o. son is happy with this phone, Developer edition makes it unique. Just be careful on the case... this is Gen 1 Moto X case."
Best android ever.
Its an amazing smarphone.
"Received phone timely. When I un packed the phone it felt like the screen was not original to the phone. Possible that seller sent a refurbished and not new. The thin plastic screen protector used in shipping had some lent under it. I removed it and screen was very rough & sticky. I used the spray from my ZAGG Invisible shield screen protector to try and clean the screen but the sticky feel never came off. It felt like it was etched into the glass.Took phone by At&t store and Radio Shack to compare and the store phone screens were nice and smooth. Also noted that the At&t store phone showed the signal is LTE. My phone also w/ At&t did not show LTE, only 4g. I tried to adjust settings under mobile network settings - preferred network type but only options were 2g or automatic. At&t sales rep said it felt like the screen was a cheap replacement screen like you would get from a mall kiosk repair while you wait place. Other than those issued phone would have been great. I really liked the voice activation and notifications for the one day I had the phone to play with it."
Too bad i should have wait and buy it much cheaper on ebay!
"would give 5 stars but says 32G, mine came with 26g, 24g usable...just saying"
best phone i've ever owned. came exactly as described
"wow what a cell phone. amazed at what it can do. kit kat installed with no problem, sound and picture quality is amazing.fits nice in my hand. i was used to the note 2. but i am loving this one. a great price for a very smart phone. GO GOOGLE NOW"
"The phone came sealed in its original box, brand new. It also came unlocked as described, no signal drops/losses so far. Phone is fast and smooth, 4g/3g, bluetooth, wifi, battery, gps and every app works just fine no crashes. Screen quality is very good much better than the Moto G and some other phones that uses LCD screens. Battery life should last about 8-14 hours depending on usage. The only thing I don't like about this phone is the camera it's not good. It only takes good photos in places with decent light (even the camera's flash does not help all the time) and in my case at specific heights/positions, however in most instances the camera sensor loses focus and darkens some areas, so yeah pretty much it. Four stars because of that.Edit #1: After doing some research on the internet I learned that there are third party apps for the camera, and I found one that has improved my pictures' quality with and without flash (specially the image focus part). I am impressed because Motorola stock camera app is not good. Also I forgot to mention that the phone's audio quality is superb (speakers, internal mic and with headphones connected), it also comes with 26gb total usable space which might or not be enough for some. I am happier now and fully satisfied! I give it 5 star!Edit #2: The phone is still excellent, I just noticed something: I mentioned that the speaker's quality is superb; however I reviewed it when playing a music file through the speakers, when making a call or receiving one in places slightly or very noisy and such, it 'can' be annoying sometimes to clearly hear the other person's voice, unlike the Moto G for example, which I also own."
"I have tested every aspect of phone of which I now. THIS PHONE IS GREAT! Got 27 hours! battery - screen was on for 4.2 hours, wifi was on for 15 hours , disabled network data. Only sim slider was a little loose. I can take off the sim slider with my fingernails when there is no number inside(number inserted feels more solid). But still, this phone deserves 10 out of 5 stars :)"
excelente telefono
I highly recommend...yup we got 2 of them......thanks again guys...cheers.
Arrived very promptly in a brand new factory sealed box. Works very well with plenty of horsepower and gigabytes for my needs. It is very well made and the Oreo color scheme makes it quite unique - although I can't say whether I love it or hate it. I was simply looking for a new unlocked GSM phone that it not the size of a big screen TV (tall order these days it seems). The price tag made it all the more appealing and in the end I'm a very happy camper indeed.
Nice
Aweome device. No regrets
Is arrived at the right time and find it brand new piece.
"Update: Overall it worked pretty darn well. However, the performance was slightly choppy/laggy. Not quite as buttery smooth as it should have been. Updated everything to the latest and the lag persisted. Not sure of the cause and even tried a few factory resets without success to the lag. Other than this, the phone works fine. Going to be retiring this device in the next few days for a Moto X Pure that does work as smooth as it should, and has a bigger screen and higher specs overall. On top of that, ​I am getting the new phone for the same price as this old phone of $299.99.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I was a little skeptical at first, as I've not bought electronics from Amazon before. However, I was pleasantly surprised that, as far as I can tell, what I received has lived up to what was advertised. I received a factory sealed Motorola box with a Brand New Motorola Moto X Developer Edition inside. No wear marks of any kind on the device. The only 'blemishes' are on the screen protector that was placed on it to protect it during shipping (as all phones have). The device is flawless. I've not yet had time to really explore the phone to see how it runs, but so far it seems perfect. I will update this review with new information after having time with it."
Great mobile phone
Something wrong with the screen a bit yellowish And the protective layer not fused well with the edge of the screen
"Built very well, has nice feel and can take on a lot of work. KitKat update works well as well. The UI is fluid, phone never hung on me and best of all NO bloat-wear, almost stock OS is brilliant!Package was sealed and received on time."
The machine is good but i complain about its battery back up...
Going from IPhone 4 I was skeptical but after one month of getting familar with Moto x I have no regrets. It is very easy to get used to and I still find more features . Overall very happy and would recommend to anyone.
Everything as good as expected.
Good phone.
perfect!
"Wow, this is such a great phone, at an unbelievable price. Sure enough, it's the end of 2014 and this is the 2013 version of the Moto X, but that does not in any way compromise the overall experience.The best things that this phone has to offer are:1) Original Google design of the operating system interface. This is no comparison to what you would get with a Samsung Galaxy S phone, which has numerous alterations and additions to Google's original, beautiful design.2) Fast software updates. When I activated the phone, it downloaded several updates that brought it right to Android KitKat (4.4) and Android 5.0 (Lollipop) is going to be released for this phone any day now. In contrast to updates on the iPhone for example, the updates on the Moto X bring along *all* of the new software features even for this older phone, and they don't slow it down to a crawl.3) Touchless controls. Just saying ""Ok Google Now"", or more recently any user-defined phrase, will wake up the phone without you having to press any buttons or the screen. This is perfect especially when driving or if you don't want to take it out of your pocket/handbag to do something quick, like setting a reminder or checking what's next on your calendar. This implementation is also pretty secure, as it trains to your voice -- nobody else can unlock your phone, unless they have a high-quality recording of course.4) No bloatware from carriers.5) Despite having a large 4.7"" screen, the body is extremely small. That's because the bezels are kept to a minimum, and the home/back/task buttons are soft-keys on the screen. This is a perfect, clean, minimalist solution, eliminating any physical buttons on the front. This also means that the phone has great long-term viability: none of those buttons can ever break (unless you break the screen of course).6) Glance notifications. The phone smartly shows notifications on its lock screen periodically, making the need for unlocking and checking individual apps / app tray unnecessary. Like on a Lumia, this can even be triggered by waving the hand above the screen, and you then also have the opportunity of unlocking the phone with a swipe on the screen. It follows another long-term benefit: You'll likely use the lock/unlock button a lot less, making unlikely that this button will break even after many years.7) It's extremely fast, responsive, and smooth.The camera is decent, however, if you are into photography I would probably recommend the Lumia 830, which should be not much more expensive, or a Lumia 1020. But you do get a nifty slow-motion cam, and even HDR on this Moto X."
"Used this one and the Moto G for about a week now.Frankly I was expecting more out of this. I felt that the battery backup should have been a little better. Love the features of the phone though. Handles small games and apps well, the voiceless control is good. And 32 GB for this price range is decent. The size is apt and it offers 4G"
Excellent phone. Nice design and made in america. Love it
My wife loves the phone and it works great.
"I'm having problems connecting to my phone carrier Don't know if it's the phone or my carrier. I will try another carrier tomorrow and see what happens. other than that I LOVE THIS PHONE!!!!! Ok Google Now is great, twist to camera is my parlor trick. When I'm getting wi-fi the updates come fast and they don't take long. the cute little spotlight animations are lovely. I love love love this phone."
"I give it four stars because the non removable battery and no sd card slot. Also The camera could be better.Although, this is a great phone for the price, and even betterit has really useful functions"
Good for the price
"Great build even though its all plastic, not as a premium feel as an iphone 5s but works just as great. Not too big, not too small, perfect for someone with mid-small hands. Comes in closed new box with all the accessories (headphones not included)"
Amazing device. I love this phone. It's unbelievably fast and google talk is wonderful. You can search for things on the internet without touching the screen! Best phone I've had so far.
"Great Android phone, and a great deal!"
"Great phone but the one I received was defective. Got it today and out of the box it's not working properly. Wi-fi and bluetooth both wont turn on at all. Also battery was at 18% and went to 0 and completely died within 3 to 4 minutes. Though I do not think this is seller's fault by any means, this is Motorola's issue. Through research I've found the Moto X is common to this issue. Contacted Motorola and they are sending replacement after paying a $250 deposit fee. Although I get that money back after defective one is returned, this hassle was not worth it."
It is just the perfect phone price/performance
"All hardware are good, and its very fast in games.. I don't like so much camera doesn't have a lot options.."
"My first smartphone. I chose it based on size/weight, battery life and storage. I am very happy with my choice. It came factory sealed and was a breeze to configure. The phone fits nicely in any pocket (jeans/shirt). It is comfortable to hold. After one month I have been getting about 1 1/2 days of use before needing to recharge. But I admit that I am not the typical user. It has mainly been used to track daily walks and play music during those walks. I have listened to music through the external speaker and headphones. Both sound fine. The screen image is sharp and very responsive to the touch.It came with KitKat 4.4.4 but it is my understanding it will get updated to Lollipop 5.0."
Excellent value for the price. Love Google Now and hand motion command features.
This phone rules. I have dropped it so many times and it is like new. The battery is starting to dissipate too quickly now but ive had it almost 2 years.
"Great phone, it is 2016 now and I still am able to use it with IOS tier smooth-ness. Camera isn't the best however; it's a problem common with moto phones."
phone died and moto would not warranty. luckily i had sq trade
an amazing product
MOTO X IS AN EXCELLENT ALTERNATIVE TO HIGHER END PHONES AND STILL HAS MOST OF THE SIMILAR BELLS AND WHISTLES. HOWEVER THE MOTO X HAS SEVERE ISSUES WITH ITS BATTERY THAT DISPENSES VERY QUICKLY AND RUNS VERY HOT.
"I'm reviewing this product about one year later. I received a call from the seller maybe 2 weeks after I purchased to politely ask me to review it. He was a nice man. Unfortunately, either his phone of the first gen Moto X is slightly disappointing in some regards. Don't get me wrong. I love the UI and its performance for the cost. However, I notice that my phone heats up QUICKLY. I bought mine refurbished though."
BATTERY NOT HARD TO AS MUCH AS MY HUSBAND IS NO SPECIAL EDITION
"Great reliable phone with everything you need. Runs smoothly, camera has a decent picture, wi-fi and GPS are strong, applications work fine. So far all games, even the most demanding 3D-games run smoothly. The screen is IPS - bright, high-contrast and has beautiful colors. The battery is fine, but could have more capacity."
Great phone for an amazing price!
Wouldn't power on after 11 months of use. Was charging the phone multiple times a day. Probably wore out the battery. It is a nice phone.Good color. Touchscreen sometimes unresponsive and jittery. Only 720p. Throttling during high intensive games or apps cause a noticeable slowdown (a second or two of delayed touch action). It is a 2-year old phone after all.
"Alright... So I've been anti smart phones for the longest, but then twist of fate and I had to buy one. I bought this one because it was cheap and reviews around the web said it's a contender for the iPhone 6 for a fraction of the price. Bought it for about 300 bucks, and it arrived in two days. Opened it up.. And damn the thing is beautiful, feels good in my hand, and my fingers gleefully glide across the screen like they're skating on ice. Turn it on and the damn thing is super fast. I'm taking videos, photos, downloads, music - it's a thing of beauty! Talking to it is a bit weird but useful sometimes, like while your driving for instance.This phone doesn't leave my side. Everywhere I go people ask me what kind of phone I've got and admire it. I admire it lol.Brilliant work Google.<3"
"Camera is not good, Get the FIRE phone instead"
Great phone for android 4 lovers..
"Amazing phone. Not a single complaint considering the price tag. I have had the Moto G 2013 for almost a year, and really wanted something that lagged less, did not have a truly awful camera, and more storage space. This is undoubtedly faster. Never really lags. Has a much better camera.I nearly bought the 2014 Moto X, but am happy I did not. This phone is about half the price and as a bonus can still be comfortably and securely used with one hand.I had to stick with either Motorola or a Nexus because I find Vanilla Android to be a delight, but after the hundreds of times I have flashed my old phones I have gotten quite tired of ROMs and nightlies being buggy and time consuming to update. If you want a phone that just works out of the box and gets reasonably timely updates, then definitely investigate Motorola and Nexus lines. Which one will be right for you depends on your budget and size preference."
"awesome phone for a really good price, brand new in box"
I did not get the developer edition. The product I received was just a XT1053 32 gb model which was basically an unlocked version of T Mobile. It did not have developer edition etched on the back of the cell phone as shown in the picture here.
"I bought this unlocked phone as I visit India frequently and would like to use there. The phone worked like a charm there immediately after inserting sim card from local carrier. Touchless controls are amazing! The phone stored each and every locations I visited abroad and, to my surprise, after I came back to USA, the story on my trip was ready for me. It stored each and every locations date wise with pictures taken at every locations. Very cool! Picture quality and organization of pictures in the phone is very nice and very easy to navigate. Even in the noisy situations abroad, the phone was able to recognize ""Ok google now"" from a distance. The driving mode function is fantastic. It was very useful there in noisy condition where ring tone is difficult to hear. It will loudly and clearly speak up name of the person calling. Driving mode feature is very powerful. The phone immediately goes into driving mode as soon as I get in car. After few days of use, it displayed time to go to work in the morning. Very useful to know especially when there is a heavy traffic or accicents. I recommend buying this phone."
The best phone for this price
"For the price this is one heck of a phone.When I bought the phone I knew it would be pretty good, but after using it for a few days I'm already blown away. The tech might be over a year old but it definitely doesn't show its age.- The 720p AMOLED screen is more than enough pixels than you'll ever need for a 4.7in display. I put it next to an iPhone 6+ and from a quick comparison you can't tell the difference in resolution between them. The smaller screen size also means you can get away with using one hand on this phone no problem.- The phone feels fast and snappy with no lag to speak of on Android KitKat. Oh yeah, it's getting an update to Android Lollipop here soon too.- Motorola's implementation of notifications with the AMOLED display is brilliant. A quick Jedi hand swoop over the display (or simply pulling it out of your pocket) will show the current time and what type of notifications you have. If you press and hold on the screen you get a preview of the notifications and are able to open them up from there. If you were to use the same system on a phone with an IPS screen it would eat through battery because it would need to illuminate the entire display whereas on the Moto X, the screen only lights up the pixels it needs to.- The use of Google Now is a step ahead of the others, even to this day. A low power system is dedicated to listening to the phrase ""OK Google Now"" allowing you to activate the service anytime, even if the phone is on standby.- Battery life is quite good. I was easily able to last an entire day with light to moderate use and all the power saving features turned off. After sleeping for 7 hours, leaving 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, and location services on the battery's charge only dropped by 4%.- Build quality is great. Not iPhone standards but very good nonetheless.My only complaint about this phone is the screen's color saturation. Colors are over-saturated, however from what I understand this is indicative of AMOLED displays (any Samsung phone with this type of display shows similar characteristics) and it's not enough to ruin the love I have for this device. After a few days I've already gotten use to it. Just don't expect very accurate color representation from anything you see on this display."
Quick and excellent!
"As soon as I turn it on the software gets update. I miss some functionality of the old phone but that is OK.The Migration Motorola app is an excellent app I just have to follow a very few steps and the information (contacts, photos, apps, messages, etc.) gets update on my Moto X practically doing nothing and just waiting some minutes to finish the upted."
"Moto X Developer Edition has proved that Specs are only for the eyes. It has one of the best user experiences I've seen. No bloatware + essential & unquire features + stock android + speed + touchless controls are very unique. On the flip side, phone is a bit slippery without a case. I would recommend the Moto X to anyone wanting a very good smartphone with killer features."
Happily this phone is exactly as advertised. It is a Developer Edition 32gb unlocked for 414.00.Delivery was within 4 days of purchase.Give 5 stars for product and service.
"this is probably not an optimal choice in a ""fast phone which is still a phone size"" department, but it is still a good phone. I would rate it more stars if I were younger and the absence of sd slot and removable battery wouldn't matter. replaceable battery, by the way, would've really useful for a phone with such a poor battery life."
I ordered the 32 gb developers edition and got a 26 gb normal version
"Love my Moto X! It's small enough to fit in my pocket and use with one hand, yet has a large 4.7"" screen. It's also my first android phone, so I LOVE ""swipe""! Great phone."
"Excellent phone, the only negative is the inability to add additional memory due to lack of a micro SD memory card slot."
"This is a great phone for a great price. Only disappointment is that LTE won't work in Europe as different bands are supported over there and the Developer Edition only has 4 languages. I wanted Italian but no luck for me (hence the 4 stars). The Verizon version seems to support all the languages, not sure why this one does not. Perhaps things will change with Lollipop but until then, no luck.Unlocked as advertised.Keep in mind that if your language is not one of the 4 supported, then also the voice controls won't work in your language."
"This is an awesome little phone. At first I had to get used to the small size, coming from a galaxy note. That didn't take long. It is snappy, no lag what so ever. The battery life is amazing, more than 24 hours. I love the fact that it knows when I am driving, in a meeting or at home. Worth every penny."
"The Moto X is one of the greatest Android devices created, in my opinion. The Moto Display and Touchless Control make using the device and breeze and changed the way we use Android forever. (Features like these are being included as of Lollipop, go Google!)Battery life is great. The phone doesn't lag, the screen is a bit over-saturated, but that is expected with AMOLED screens. The phone is a bit small for my taste (coming from a Nexus 5) but it fits in my pocket that way, and with a case, this means the phone is not at risk of being too big.Now it just needs an update to Lollipop, come on Motorola!"
Awesome. Brand new in box. Love it so far. Popped my ATT Sim in and was ready to go. Only minor gripe is it doesn't actually say Developer Edition on the back which for some might be great (no writing or branding) but I thought it was kind of cool. Oh well. Other than that everything's awesome as expected. Amazing device.
Love this phone. Great form factor not too big like all new phones seem to be. Rooted and loving it.
Love the phone so far!
Excellent cell phone!!!!Very fast delivery!
perfect
"Excelente Cellphone, for the price the quality, I bought it and connected in south America !!!!! It works very well!!!I would not suggest to update it to Lollipop 5. because it may run slow and the battery may run empty faster. I only write this, because of my experience, with the Moto G Second Generation."
"We could not be less satisfied with Motorola's support. The phone itself is very nice, however, the screen should not shatter when dropped from 2ft to a floor. The phone was rendered entirely unusable with the screen shattered in at least fifty pieces, and the touichscreen no longer worked, nor did the entire screen display.We attempted to talk to Motorola about warranty service and after asserting that they would charge us for the repair on our six week old phone, they refused to discuss the matter, and we actually had two different customer service people silently hang up on us. We were not belligerent, we were entirely polite and would have even considered some compromise.This sours our entire impression of Motorola as a company to do business with. Having a problem is understandable, rude customer service is not."
This is a great phone! I got it to replace a phone that didnt meet my needs for internal memory. My new MotoX Developer GSM has 32 gigs of internal memory which is great. The phone size fits my hand perfect. The clarity of the pictures is extraordinary and I'm easily able to multitask on the phone. On the downside the battery life is short. All in all this is a super phone for my needs.
"This has been the best phone I've owned so far, even compared to the Nexus phones. The screen is bright, the phone isn't too large or too small, it's lightweight, and the battery life is almost double what I got with the Nexus 4."
excelente.
"Excellent phone. Actually, this is my third Android, and this one is the best I ever had! The system is fast, fluid, no lags at all. Good capacity: I could install all my apps and could put a lot of music/podcast in it, and still it has more than 10GB free!!"
"Awesome phone, the rest of the world is just now catching up to its features, out performs many quad processor phones (until ART Android by default really only runs on dual cores, requiring special programming for multi core applications) because of the function offloading the device does to the specialized additional processors Motorola added to the device."
"Excellent phone, without the carrier bloat!"
Its a very cute mobile and performs very well .Charge lasting for a day eventhough my data is on and playing games as well.Active display and touchless control is working very well
My friend just loves it !!!
"I like this phone, it just plain works."
Love it.
Excellent
Excellent phone!!!
"Where to start; the device is exceeding the whole list of requirements, and is good for other aspects; great value for 290 dollars (absolutely not a good value for 799); these are my considerations.To begin with; I have been using an iPhone 5S for a while, and I've always purchased iPhone, but lately I felt like I don't really want to be tied to a carrier, and have a 2 year agreement to have the iPhone, so I decided to go for an unlocked device that is a good value for what it offers. The Samsung and the iPhone are great devices but the 800 dollars pricetag is out of this world in my opinion...I don't buy a device that cost more than 300 dollars, because it is a moral obligation to not pay such prices for a phone; because in the end that's what they are (personal opinion, moving on).This device is fast, the generous amount of memory make it responsive to app swapping and scrolling. The main processor is not that strong, but the X uses a combination of chipset, which include a dedicated 3d chip and another couple that take care of notifications and backend services. This result in blazing fast performances, even if technically the phone is inferior on the paper to many other devices.The memory is not upgradeable, but 32 gb are plenty; especially if you don't put hundreds of apps that you never use, or movies and videos that you rarely watch. Speed is good enough nowadays to use streaming, so you can use cloud services and save space on your device, for the data that you really need (depends if you have it as toy or as phone/work item; that would dictate how you use it I believe).The look is gorgeous, slightly curved and fit perfectly in my hands (I have average hands for a 6 feet man); the screen is OLED, so the same as you can see on a PS Vita and other modern devices. It is nice and bright; incredibly crisp, even if the pixel distribution and the resolution are not the same as a retina. I've been using Retina display and iPhones for years, and I can't really see the difference on the Moto X, even when reading documents or internet pages. I wear glasses, so to me the screen quality is essential, and this device fits me perfectly.The button location is a bit strange, since the power is on the right, above the volume rocker, but it is not a big deal Then you will find the micro usb connector on the bottom and the headphone jack on the top (talking about top and bottom, when you have a rotating screen, has little meaning IMO).The speakers are good (one single speaker in the back of the device); music and movie play well on it, but you may want to use headphones. The camera is really good quality; altho the software is not allowing you to control easily the focus point, and in low light conditions is easy to loose track of the focus, so you end up aiming at something and having on focus something that is much closer, because the camera software change at the last moment.To take pictures you tap on the screen; this is counter intuitive if you are used to an iPhone, where you tap to set focus and ""aperture"" (there is no such thing, but I can't find a better analogy); I can't understand yet how do you decide what has to be locked in focus with the camera software, but I believe it is a matter of practice. The results are great outdoor, in good light condition and with static subjects; I tried to take photos of moving subjects like people, and the results are good, if you do not have too many objects on different planes, so the sensor does not get confused.The camera has the flash led, not necessary but super necessary in most cases (included when you need a flashlight :) ), it shine brightly but the range seems inferior to the one on the iPhone 5S.You can launch the camera when the phone is locked, jsut doing a quick double wrist rotation. Gimmicky but works fine when you don't want to unlock the phone.2 nice features added to this device are the interactive notification system, and the vocal commands.The notfication system is less intrusive, and since the OLED display uses only the pixels that it turns on, you don't waste battery life.Basically the screen will show you an icon when you get a notification, and you may decide to slide up and go to the app that notified you, or slide down to just unlock. The notification will continue to appear at intervals (not flashing, the notification fade in and out very discreetly), unless you slide the cursor tapping on the screen and dragging the finger on the side of the device. You can still have regular notifications with audio and vibration, it is up to you. I like this because it is discreet and elegant.The second is the voice recognition; where you just say ""hey google now"", and the device listen to your commands. So far it gets all that I say, and English is not my first language. Siri user will not notice much of a difference; the service seems to use the same procedure, where it will go online and elaborate your request, then return the results on your phone. It won't accept complex command in sequence, like if you need to find a store and find if the store is open; because the previous command results is not concatenated to the next one. This means that you need to ask for a store near you, and then ask if that store near you is open. Not a deal breaker, since Siri does not do that either, but would be nice to have a system that you can actually talk to, freely, without use your hands (super useful if you have your hands dirty or working; vocal commands are a great alternative).Some people love games: this one run games. I am a benchmark fan, so I downloaded 3dmark and few others; and beside the galaxy note 4 and few others, the performances were above all the other devices that has a higher price tag. I play some games and the graphic is smooth and crisp; keep in mind thou that the battery life will go down drastically. The back of the unit seems to heat up more when you do processing work, with games it stay moderately cool.The battery is the main problem for me so far: it won't last the same as my iPhone 5S. I keep it mainly in my pocket or on my desk; I receive and make phone calls (probably few calls, 10-20 minutes in total per day), play occasionally a game while waiting in line and mostly I check email and use the web. I can go on for a day, but then the phone just can't go on anymore. The iPhone would be charged every 2-3 days, so to me this is a big drop in battery life. I am not sure if I have problems because of the battery, because I do not know Android very well, or I am setting something incorrectly. Just a heads up to give you an idea.The unit is unlocked; uses a micro sim card and the only issue is the trapdoor used to insert the sim: it has a very flimsy lock, and feels like the card may escape at any time. Takes no effort to open it with the included tool; probably this is due the fact that the tray is made of plastic, while on the iPhone, it is in metal, so it gives more resistance and overall it is more solid. I do not feel totally comfortable moving the phone around, but it may be just my feeling (hope that nobody lost their sim card with this phone).You can use any network supported (I believe anything but CDMA, works in EU for sure, with GSM 900/1800; I did not try data traffic outside USA yet, but it should be of use to you anywhere you go (double check the network available when you travel).The developer edition is also different, since you are not forced to use the Motorola build of Android (which is excellent; not much has been added, is very vanilla); if you want, you may request an unlock code for the bootloader, and you will be able to write new OS images on the device (Android is supported, not sure if it may run anything else). This is not for the average user; if you are interested in developing on Android OS, then this device is perfect for you, but if you just want to use the device, you can leave it as is, not unlock the bootloader and you won't loose anything.I did not shop around to see if there is a non developer edition, since this is what I was looking for; if there is a model that cost less, because is not the developer edition, and you are not interested in developing, you may want to look for that.Accessories included are a charger, a micro usb cable and a useful sim tray tool, so you avoid to use a paperclip. This device is not coming with headphones, which is OK. You can use any device that support Android via bluetooth (headphones or earbud, with or without microphone), or regular headsets with the standard 3.5 inch jack (I have a pair of universal Bose with mic, they work fine).Overall is a 5 star, for the price of 300 dollars (you may find it for less; this is the 32 Gb version, the biggest that they make, I believe), great for people that work with the phone, great for the average user, great for gamers (I won't give this to under 18; check the Moto G for kids friendly devices), but absolutely awesome for developers.Ditch the next iPhone, and save yourself 600 dollars; unless you are forced with iOS (which is superior to Android, IMO), otherwise this phone does everything in the same way, and you are also able to develop on it and learn something that can be sold."
"battery life sucks. I wonder I got a lemon. Otherwise, really nice phone."
"UPDATE 1/25/2015: I gotta deduct 1 star because of the GPS. I used to be able to use My Tracks on my Nexus 5 to record walks. Walks in exactly the same area with my Moto X record a small fraction of the path I walk. The other day it recorded less than .5 miles for a 4 mile walk. Yes, I carried it in the same pocket on the same route that I used with the Nexus 5. Very disappointing.My Nexus 5 died and I needed a developer phone. The price was right on this one, so I went for it. It's a tad smaller than my Nexus 5, but I don't really notice that. The screen is very nice. What I love most are the active notifications. That's enough to sway me right there.One problem: the headphone jack. If you google this phone for ""headphone jack problems"" you'll get a lot of hits. I returned my first phone because it didn't work right. Problem is, the second phone behaved exactly the same way! I tested with 4 separate headsets. All of them had inline mics and buttons. Half the headsets didn't work (got only one channel or the button didn't work).So, it's pretty clear that either I got two broken phones (with EXACTLY the same defect) or there is a design flaw in this phone.The good news is that I was able to find a cheap cable that worked for me. It'shttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K36XWG0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_15"
"Far better than my previous phone, and I have not had any issues with it so far. I only use the Wifi, and it seems to last about two days with my light usage."
"Great phone. I read reviews of smart phones from 2014 and saw the moto x consistently get good reviews. I went out on a limb buying the developer addition, but there is nothing to worry about. It is unlocked as is, and you can unlock it (root it) further if you want. I haven't yet and don't plan on it soon. The one bonus with the developer addition is that it doesn't come with any extra crap apps, just google stuff when you log into you google account and moto apps (like moto assist, which is fantastic if you don't mind having location on).I strongly suggest buying this phone. Great screen, good camera, great speed and RAM, big enough SD storage (not removable or upgradable).Buy it if you aren't psyched by the ubiquitous phablet. Ditch the Google Nexus 6 and buy this instead for half the cost."
"I have now owned the moto x (1st gen) developer edition for over 3 months. It is a smooth operating android phone, and has no bloatware.I am using on T-Mobile Simple Choice, and get great data speeds.The phone also has some neat tech. features that you won't find elsewhere, such as the AMOLED active display (see what's going on without waking up the phone), and waking the phone & responding by saying ""ok google now"", which is made possible by its additional low-power NLP processor.I haven't bothered to unlock the boot loader and root, because there is little need to (no painful, slowing bloatware to uninstall) - the phone is very good just as it is. I did however install (from Google Play) a more flexible launcher that suits my tastes.I'm very positive on this phone, but let me say that having to use ADB on a PC to unlock is a little 'heavy'. Samsung phones can ClockworkMod just by copying the zip file and rebooting. Maybe Motorola wants only 'serious' developers to unlock. There is no reason why Motorola could not simply have built the unlock, and root access, into the android settings!After 3 months I have a just a few gripes:1) when the screen powers off any music that is playing will pause for a half-second2) the dialer is awkward - I find myself calling a contact, when all I wanted to do was edit their contact data3) the device hasn't received an upgrade to Lollipop yetThese gripes don't amount to much. The moto x developer edition is a phone that I'm pleased to own, and expect to be using as my primary phone for two years (maybe more)."
everything works exceptionally fine but the battery for some reason is absolutely horrible. I've owned a Moto X before and it used to have the 24 hour battery life but this one even after the first 5 charge cycles has a horrible battery life and I'm pretty sure it's just because it was on charge for over a year
"It arrived as promised in new, sealed condition. The phone has been flawless and what it lacks in speed/screen size, it makes up for with a phenomenal user experience. I like to call it the iPhone of Android when I describe it to people. No bloatware or unnecessary crap, just everything you need that makes this phone unique and quite possibly the best on the market. I switched from a galaxy note 2 and I don't regret it one bit."
"The phone is brand new, delivered in the original sealed retail box. Motorola has said that the 2013 Moto X will be upgraded to Android 5.0 Lollipop, and Motorola said they will roll out as many Moto X 2014 software features to the Moto X 2013 as the 2013 model's hardware will support. At $299 for this 32 GB Developer Edition, this is a really good value.The white back of this phone looks like it is a rough cloth fiber material, however it is not rough at all, it has a translucent-iridescent look like carbon fiber and is smooth, like the surface of carbon fiber. I had no problems using the phone on Cricket Wireless, other than the sim that the store clerk uses to ""test"" for compatibility didn't work with my phone. I went ahead and purchased my own Cricket Wireless Sim from the store, registered it with my phone's IMEI number and it had no problems connecting to the Cricket network.Cricket Wireless uses AT&T's network and it currently offering 10 Gig of data for $55 a month (by using autopay), unlimited voice and texts."
Good phone but baterry of my unit seems to be defective. Im only getting 2023 mAh with full charge instead of the 2200 mAh promised in the spec. The Results is that compare to my other moto x I've got with this one at least 2 hours less battery life (with same use). Also it became warm (40°C) really quick when using it.
"I love this phone. I had looked at the Moto X 2014, Nexus 6, Samsung Note, Moto G. This phone is the best of both worlds, its a good value at $300 v. $500 or $600 for most other high end phones, while including many of the same features as the compeition. The battery life is far better then my Nexus 4. Even with moderate use the battery lasts me the whole day !"
happy with product. Met all my expectations.
Definitely the one to go with if you want to customize and root your phone and still keep your warranty. The best of both worlds!
"Love everything about this phone. More than I expected, easy to use, big memory, fun, different from the others, omg"
Good
The moto x 2013 DE is an okay phone in my opinion. After owning it for about a year i can say that the battery life was not that great. It was always running out by the end of the day with medium usage. Also now after only about a year of usage the mic sometimes stops working requiring me to restart the phone and i stop receiving messages which also requires me to restart. The phone does have plenty of storage for all your apps and pictures/music so that is a plus but a poor battery life and issues with messages and mic brings it down for me.
Nice phone.
Not much to say that has been said already. One of the best phones I have ever used. The phone is extremely efficient at multi tasking its OK for games when your in a waiting room. Its a really smooth experience. The only problems I have with it are. 1 I wish the screen was brighter in direct sunlight. To be fair no phone I have used ever passed that test though. 2 its half way into 2015 and still no Lollipop not to big of a deal but still. The camera is hit or miss. Somtimes it takes good pictures and sometimes it doesn't. If you fool with it you can get a decent photo but its not convenient like just flicking your wrist and snapping a shot. It should just be fluid as that no fooling around with where your standing because the auto HDR is crap. With those aside this is a great a phone very well made. I will probably get another moto x when the time co!es I really like this phone and what it has to offer so I will be sticking with the X line for awile.
good phone
"It is a very good phone for the price. It gets hot with lot of video or games, which happens in most of the phones I have seen. Touch screen is good and very responsive. Battery lasts for about a day with 75% of the time in either 4G/WiFi."
They sent me a Verizon xt1060 model. Had to send it back. I wanted xt1053 developers edition. Description was wrong.
Bit old
"excellent phone and excellent price. T Mobile, no issues. need a micro sim card. they can cut it for you at the store, or buy a new one.no issues at all have had it for 5 months now."
This is being sold as the GSM edition (1053) but I have received two Verizon edition (1060) phones so far. This listing needs to be updated if no more GSM developer phones are available.
"Oh my God, this Smartphone is just AMAZING, I'm from Venezuela, and works perfectly with Movistar, Digitel and Movilnet. I have no complains about this Moto X, just buy this phone ppl xD"
This phone is really awesome... Under 300$ unlocked!!! You just can't beat that with the specs it has. Also its a developer edition so you can do all the tinkering you want if your into stuff like that like me. Easy bootloader unlocking. Overall I'm happy with my purchase..
"The phone I received was not a developer edition, and it seems as if the battery may have bulged, as the case is separating along volume/power buttons. The phone it self should be great, I've used and worked with one before, but the experience with this purchase has been awful. Planning on returning the product today."
"The x 2013 should.d not even be on my list. Moto has no support in my country and is not even sold as a grey import. Besides the asking price is very high in comparison to competition. Then I learned of this new pricing so i managed to get a hold of one 32 developer edition moto x. I bought it based on reviews without ever seeing one in the flesh. And I was not disappointed. The reviews were spot on. The phone good side includes design, screen, speed, ease of holdin and, acceptable battery life. The bad side are the speakers ad the camera esp. At low light levels. For the price this is bargain but the story doesn't end here. Most android devices are clones of each other. Depending on what u spend u get a mixture of specs and a altered version of android. Moto offered stock android, put in a few very clever apps of its own so that updates are available faster than the rest. And it managed to use hidden potential of the OS. That is the touch less control. It does really work and it makes everyone else envious. Active display is also nice and it strikes me how it took so long for someone to think of it. Bottom line if this is your price range no need to look further. U.ll be surprised. Did I mention Spotlight. Trust me this phone will make Samsung's and iPhone worthless."
"Basically a great phone. Good battery life (30 hours with normal use). 2GB of RAM means once you open something you can swith back and forth between other applications without any lag. I love AMOLED displays and in turn ""active notifications"" as well. I disabled the voice recognition as I don't plan to use it, to increase battery life. 4,7 is the perfect screen size for me. The speaker is OK, although not great for music, but that's not the purpose of a speaker on a phone. Feels snappy all-around, and got the bootloader unlocked and the phone rooted 30 minutes after opening the box, to get rid of the really few bloatware apps that came pre-installed (2 or 3 at most).It came in it's sealed box with everything in it (earphones not included). All in all, a fantastic phone for the price, and more than enough for 90% of the people out there."
"I had a 16GB Moto X, and was tired of running out of space, which is the worst part about these phones, not having a slot for an SD card. That and not being able to remove the battery, but I love the quality of the phone so much, and for the price, I decided to get myself a 32GB and give the 16GB to my daughter."
just as advertised
It was everything I expected.
THANK YOU..
"Previously had a Nexus 4, the Moto X outperforms it and is one of the better phones I've owned in recent years."
"I bought this phone a month ago. It was ok until a week ago, when suddenly, I woke up to find a purple/pink vertical line running through the screen. I have to emphasize that, of course, the phone didn't receive any impact. I would like to have some kind of solution from the company I bought the phone from."
"I bought three cellphones. One is detective, curved screen. It does not support the glass. As I can make the seller replace the productos because the warranty is valid? Thank you"
excellent
"Phone seemed great but only after about a month it developed green lines running across the screen. After research these lines seem like a very common hardware fault rendering this phone (and the Droid Turbo 2) an awful purchase. Motorola might claim that it is due to user error, but when a hardware problem is this widespread it is clearly a design fault(I can find the exact same green lines in the exact same place from many many others). For the past 5 years I have been a loyal Motorola customer but this experience has soured me to the whole brand. Do not buy."
Grate phone!Somehow a plug that is US type adapter included. I never need a finger print function and extra functions.Very useful. This phone might be last solid phone.
"Great deal, excellent product"
I just love it

"Excelent camera, grate sound."
"I was so excited when I received the phone, but then I got an unpleasant surprise... It was the wrong version, the product is advertised as the XT1562 but got the XT1564 model... I was like ""what is this model? I've never read about this one"", so I googled ""Moto XT1564 Play"" and clicked the third link.It explains that this model (XT1564) is the same as the XT1565 model, aka Droid Maxx 2. Yes, I got the bloatware verizon-free version of the Droid Maxx 2...So the product is not the one as described in this page, PLEASE CORRECT THIS.I'll keep the phone because it's a good phone."
Awesome camera. 4g LTE works on T-Mobile :) battery life lasts all day without even charging once. And I use it a lot.
"I told my sister to get this phone because it has great specs and because she wanted a phone with an fm tuner. However, the system app for it isn't compatible with the version of Android it came with and it is hidden as such."
Exelent
"This Motorola phone is an excellent cellular, but I don't like the Android sistem. I prefer Black Berry sistem!!"
Excellent!
"great screen, updated with latest version."
perfect!
Ok
"The phone is very good, fast, comfortable, good size and good finish. The battery does not last all that the report says, the only problem is the unstable of Android 6.0 that makes the phone will restart several times a day.For the price, Motorola could put some headphones, all that brings in the box is the charger."
It's broke
Just great
"Please help, the phone is locked and it does not recognize the sim card. How can I unlock it?"

This phone was the best money I have ever spent. I cant express anything more then that. You need to hold it to understand.
Excellent. Product as described
"The touch screen is not work. I'm very disapointed, and I can't contact seller. Very bad."
This was to replace my previous motoX XT1058 which was lost. This is probably the best phone I have used. I tried the new Moto X pure edition but it was too big to fit in my pocket and uncomfortable to hold. All other phones (newer models) that are of similar size do not have the performance and features of this phone.
Amazing phone
"I bought this phone for my wife as I have the same model xt1053 developer edition, which i have been using for 3 year with no complains. Received as per advertised. Phone is great and it is fully unlocked. I tested using T-mobile and ATT and everything seems to work as expeced (including hotspot/ thetering)."
The phone never worked properly. I even took it to the AT&T store and they installedva new SIM csrd and the phone still would bsrelly maintain a signal. The seller was fair snd i returned the phone and they refunded my money. Great seller and cutomer service. Unfortunately the phone was defective.
"The phone is,a very fantastic. Very disappointed with battery life. Phone dies very quickly"
like
Excelente!
"The only issue with the phone is when putting the phone up to your face to talk or listen to voicemail then having to push end or your passcode or anything on the screen it remains dark. The only that ""wakes it up"" is there other person hanging up. Tried power button but it didn't work in those instances"
very good.
"This phone is perfect for what I need I bought this one to replace my old one because the camera broke. I had that one for over 2 years without a problem unlike some of my experiences with phones like Apple and Samsung. Highly recommended if you want a reliable and able phone, it takes great pictures also."
excellent
excellent
The phone charger stop working 3 days after a got the phone. I dial 3 to 5 time before the phone can make a call. I can't send sms it doesn't work. If you are planing to buy this phone don't fall in the trap. I wrote to the seller 1month ago and he never replied back that is a scam.
Locked. I cant use it. Nor the seller neither amazón took the responsability.
"By seeing the cost and specifications, i thought it's great product.After opening the box i found there is a little hole(damage) at speakers. I took it easy because it's very small.After an hour of usage felt the first shock it got switched off!!! I was fully disappointed(although it restarted itself).It continued for 10 days(6 to 7 times it happened in middle of my work).And the ear phones they are horrible creating disturbing sounds.And one last thing although it supports LTE i never experienced that even my sim is 4G.finally i fed up and returned the product and ordered moto g3(waiting for it ).Any ideas about g3?"
"The phone is in perfect conditions, however, the box was kind of damaged. The main problem is that the tool needed to remove the sim trail was not included in the box and I was not able to make the phone work with my sim card at the beginnig."
"the phone has problems with the front microphone and camera freezes at every minute, when people call me always hear me away with poor audio quality and when I record a voice memo is the same, only it works with headphones and when I put the call out loud , I downloaded all updates from google play but nothing solves the problem I would like to return the equipment and be replaced by another."
Just amazing!

"The phone itself was great and I love the Moto X. Unfortunately the phone was not properly unlocked for use on a GSM network. It worked with problems initially -- calls being dropped, cell coverage coming in and out... but after about a month its ability to text ended completely. T-Mobile could see the phone, but it kept constantly knocking itself off their network. I contacted the sellers, but they were ignorant (thought T-Mobile was part of Sprint) and unhelpful. They were not willing to give me a return and I was hoping to swap it for another phone that was properly unlocked -- didn't want my money back, just a properly working phone. I recomend the phone, but ""satisfaction guaranteed"" is a misnomer."
The Moto X I received was exactly as it was represented. Like new condition. And I was able to upload Lollipop 5.0 with no problems. Very satisfied.
"I bought it to use it in Argentina. It works but i had some issues. First of all to update android i need to do it throught my Pc with a verizone tool. Now it works very good but when I call to my cellphone provider (Claro) #611 it calls to verizone in USA. And when I lose a phone call and i press the option ""call back"" it adds automatically a +1 in front of the number to call to USA. So it says number doesn't exist. I need to look in contact list and have the numbers set up with +54 in the front. For these last 2 errors I couldn't find a solution yet."
"Not a new phone, did not come with sim card, or card changer. I had checked off ""new"" on the amazon sidebar, so I thought it would be a new phone. I will check back in with how it actually performs, if I can get it running."
"Great phone at first, and I had no problems with Verizon, but it only lasted 3 months. Now it won't turn on."
Works as promised.
Great phone!! Smaller than most but I like that!
very good
As promised. Gen 1 Moto X. Cheaper than fixing a broken screen for $150+
"I have had bad luck with ordering mobile phones through Amazon! I ordered this Motorola MOTO S ST1060 on July 15, 2015. The phone worked the first month but the MOTO phone stopped being able to receive of place calls after that first month. I could only use the message function. Now the phone has completely stopped working. (The phone has not been dropped or gotten wet) Since I purchased this phone on July 15, 2015 it is no longer returnable. To be fair to the brand another member of our family has had his MOTO X phone for almost two years and has not had any issues. The non-problematic MOTO phone was purchased at the Verizon store, plus I am not sure it is the exact same model as this one that I purchased in July. Motorola MOTO X XT1060 16GB 4G LTE Verizon CDMA / Unlocked GSM Phone - White"
This phone met my expectations; my only problem with the selection of smartphones are that there are not enough CMDA smartphones for Verizon customers.
It works as expected like a new phone.
"Works fine, but Sprint is having a hard time activating it. So far it's just a wifi machine. Would also like to note that the headphone jack is not compatible with any nice headphones. It can only be used with TRS (2 rings) headphones, not TRRS (3 ring) connectors. VERY slow to charge."
"This a is a pretty good phone for the price. No real complaints, but no real compliments either."
"I had to do a system update when the phone arrived and it worked perfectly after that. A great value for the price.5 stars – I love it! It is awesome and I highly recommend everyone to purchase this product!4 stars – I like it, but there are some flaws but I would purchase again.3 stars - It was okay, but I would probably not buy it again unless there are no other options.2 stars – There may be worse products out there, but you can definitely find something better.1 star – I dislike the product, I wish I had not purchased it and will not recommend the product to others.If my review was helpful, I would appreciate your feedback by clicking the 'Yes' button below. Thanks!"
"The phone was suppose to be a new phone and when I received it , it was a used phone and wouldn't work."
We are on the Straighttalk plan on the Verizon network and this phone works flawlessly with Straighttalk. My family has three of these phones.
"Unit shipped as unlocked Moto-X, new in box (it was, no problem there), but proprietary software from Verizon makes phone not 100% compatible with other networks. Discovered the hard way, cannot send pic's nor multi-MMS. Seeking to return/exchange for a phone interoperable with AT&T."
Exellent product
Great phone
What I expected
"Great phone but it only will texting is a problem on TMobile network. Some times they go out other times not. Tmobile says that is because it is a ""Verizon phone"". Other than that huge flaw it is a good phone."
Excellent!
My son loves his Moto X. Works well on Selectel Wireless/Verizon network.
As advertised. Works with Selectel Wireless/Verizon network.
"It only got 1 star because I couldn't put 0. I have never cracked a screen on a phone ever in my life and the one time This phone dropped, the screen just shattered into pieces. I only had it for a day before it broke. My heart broke when the screen did. Saddest part of this whole thing is that there is no warranty and I just wasted $180"
"Phone is working fine, price quite convenient for performance."
ok
"I purchased this phone specifically to take from the U.S. and use overseas in the middle east. This phone is amazing! From the sound quality to taking pictures. It is a terrific phone! It worked with the cell phone carrier that was overseas with no problems at all. The mobile data runs smooth and quickly with apps. If you are looking for a quality, name brand, unlocked cell phone...this is a great device to get. Not only did it work overseas for me, now I can use it right here in the States with my current cell provider.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"I bought this for a friend. Verizon had to send a new SIM, which they did at no cost. Registering it on Verizon was easy enough. It was a nice, inexpensive upgrade from an entry-level Moto Android phone. Bigger screen, more storage, faster CPU, and LTE. A great value if you're stuck on Verizon."
"Bought this as a replacement phone for the wife. Okay replacement, but, poor battery life."
"great phone,great price,always!"
Nice phone for the money. Does everything I expect it to.
The phone was like new. You could not make a difference. Thanks!

"I just received the device, it came in the original sealed box, it seems new and it has the Verizon SIM card. Couldn't test it too much yet, but so far, everything is ok.I've a question though, I'm not from the US and I have no Verizon account nor any contract with any carrier in this country. As soon as I turned on my device I was connected to 4G through Verizon network. Will I be charged in any way for this? Do I have some kind of prepaid credit which I can use in the US till it expires?thanks!"
Absolutely love my Moto X phone! Everything I wanted it to be. Waiting for the lollipop upgrade and was told it would be uploaded automatically. Always been a Motorola girl and they continue to excel while being affordable versus the more expensive options on the market.
"Very disappointed. I was looking for an AT&T compatible phone. This is advertised as an unlocked GSM phone (which is compatible), but I received a Verizon phone, which is CDMA. It ""works"", but a lot of the functionality does not work, it has low bars of service, and is on an "" H"" network rather than 4G LTE. The phone I received even had the name Verizon written across it, which is not as advertised."
"Verizon simply sucks! You can't use the phone at all! No matter what sim card you put into it.Unless you go to verizon to activated The phone itself is great, but terrible if embedded with Verizon wireless! (XT1060) is not recommended at all..."
Works good. Battery lasts well. Fast. But it does not have the capability of a wi fi hotspot.
"Its a good phone, has to problem, you cannot change the battery (closed) and cannot input an sd card.I bought 2 of them and one has an error when its update de OS, is reparing it now because the ROM fail. I dont know if it has solution...."
"Just as expected...8/11/15 update... the radio transmitters on this unit are not working, so no wifi or bluetooth...will see if vendor offers a remedy"
"The phone itself is pretty good, but it sometimes alternates between having 5-bars and no signal until i reboot the phone, or activate and deactivate plane mode. This makes making a call very frustrating sometimes, and an annoyance when it interrupts a call in progress.There are also instances when after rebooting the phone shows a message saying the SIM comes from an unknown or incompatible source, but then it works again after a bit.This would've been a 4 or 5-star review if it were not for those issues because it's a great phone overall."
This phone was NEW! The packaging was perfect! I had no trouble activating with verizon! So pleased with my new phone.
I love this phone!
I previously had an LG G3 with Verizon. I didn't have insurance on it and I dropped it and broke it. I bought this phone as a replacement. It came quickly and was in original packaging unopened with charger. It's an awesome little phone. Everything worked out great and even though it's not as advanced as my LG G3 was I love it. It's a perfect size (about the size of an iphone5). After getting this phone I will likely stick to Motorola phones- great quality.
I love it! Came with SIM card ready to go on Verizon. This is the best phone I have ever used.
Very good phone for the price met expectations
"This phone is refurbished. So it works great so far (had it for a week). I just wished the listing would have stated that it was refurbished. This my second moto x.This one did not come in the factory original box and and came with a weird charger - the charger works but not as well as my original one. Also, it does not, again doesn't come with the Sim card tool that my factory original did."
My camera flash didn't work when I received the phone.
The product has a problem with de frontal camera. Delivery was excellent and on time.
"So far so good! I ordered this phone and it was delivered two days later. They said it could be up to a week but it arrived very fast. Looks brand new and seems to work just fine. I will get the SIM card installed today and if everything goes according to plan I will come back and update my review to 5 stars. I had a phone just like this one for about two years which I accidentally destroyed last weekend. They don't make 'em like this anymore. They are all ""phablets"" now, which I cannot stand. If you want a decent smartphone that you can use with one hand, this is an excellent choice and I have been quite pleased with this seller."
It worked in Argentina as expected
I was very pleased with this phone. Came brand new in package. Worked great with straight talk!! 5 stat for sure!!! It's fast and perfect size :)
excellent
"Poor battery, the signal difference"
"This phone is a good phone, I can surf the web fine and it can call fine too. However, it can't always send a text for me. I tried switching carriers, but the problem still wasn't fixed. Everything about the phone is good, but it just can barely text. I always get a message saying, ""The message failed to send. Touch to review the message."" There were some places that I could send messages from and some places that I could not. Most times I had 3 or 4 bars and the message still wouldn't send. I'm taking it to the store to get it fixed, I hope I can be able to text."
says it works for tmobile but had nothing issues trying to keep the phone on the correct band for LTE. Not for tmobile!
This low rate is for the seller not the product. This is not a new seald phone and it is not unlocked as described. It is used and did not work with my Tmobile sim card. it says it is a verizon phone all over it.
"Marked as GSM, was a Verizon-only CDMA phone."
Great seller! Item as described. Highly recommend!
I received an XT1058 in an odd box (not the original Motorola Box) which makes me think this is not a new phone. The XT1058 does NOT work on Verizon! The phone I received even has AT&T branding on the back of it. The seller needs to either ship the correct item or change the item description. Think stinks because I was counting on having this phone for my wife before our vacation tomorrow and now I have no phone for her. I would not recommend this seller.
grat phone light slim works so fast with 4 g have to figure a few thigns out but not bad
"works great. just went to Verizon for a painless switch from the old phone. is much faster than the 2011 Motorola droid.BTW Verizon now offers good no-contract plans if you bring your own phone now. It now makes sense to buy a slightly older model phone yourself from Amazon, and avoid getting into a 2 year contract."
"Type of fabric that utterly clings! Otherwise, a nice product."
"A very good phone for the money if you're looking to buy a phone without contract! Service was excellent and no problems with the Moto X so far. Activating the phone was a breeze also, got it done without having to get the runaround of some customer service representative!"
The phone itself is very impressive yet my rate is due to the fact that it doesn't connect to my Wi-Fi router as well as Bluetooth as I have tried it on multiple sources. I will be returning this item and very upset because I actually liked the phone.
A+
One of the best android phones on the market especially for the price
Excelente
"This phone is old hat now, a new moto x is here, and the competition have all gone through update cycles, and whereas this device was middle of the road in terms of specs, it's updated version is not, therefore no need to get this phone.... Or so I thought.I have rarely been this wrong in my assessment.PERFORMANCE: The 2013 moto x absolutely flies! It is smooth, and fast. Apps launch pretty fast, and you won't notice the difference until you use it side by side with the latest devices (and who does that anyways?) Magnificent stock interface, that uses the 2 GB ram very efficiently, and keep an eye on 3rd party apps that may prevent the phone from sleeping.SCREEN: Pretty screen, that's only 720p but still draws oohs and aahs when in whip it out, despite the critiques of Amoled screens, I have found no fault with it. I love the saturated colors, I love the deep blacks, and it feels like the screen is painted directly on the glass. it becomes slightly difficult to read outdoors in bright sunlight occasionally, especially if you wear sunglasses.PHYSICAL: The phone itself is the perfect size, slim bezels and rounded back make it very ergonomic. The weight is well balanced and feels substantial and high quality and dense without feeling cumbersome.CAMERA: The camera isn't top of thee line in terms of performance, but it is good enough. And if you're patient enough you can get most excellent results from the optics. it is obvious when you use it that the lens was built to draw in more light, but that sometimes backfires, at night it becomes very noisy and the color balance trends to oscillate wildly in the dark unless you focus and expose it manually. During the day, the same lens often washes out colors if not focused properly. But if you manual focus, the picture is very good. Auto HDR is available as an option which automatically attempts to reduce this issue by merging multiple exposures into a 'perfect' exposure value. And while the HDR is a little aggressive, it works pretty well to mitigate these issues. The flash is bright but very cool in color. A SIDE NOTE: two stand out features of the camera that I found in my use were; 1. Most excellent macro capabilities (one of a kind) 2. The wrist twist gesture to launch the camera from sleep is quick and works like a charm, launching the camera mere moments later (life saver).SPEAKER/CALL QUALITY: The main speaker is loud and clear, but can get muffled occasionally if put on its back. But it has good clarity. The earpiece speaker is also clear and loud, and calls generally sounded crystal clear and without echoes or static.BATTERY LIFE: heavy user? You'll have to charge it 1.25 times daily. It is sufficient for about 12-14 hours of use. But you'll have to give it a short supplementary charge in the middle of the day. Moderate to light user? You'll get through the day easily, with about 15-16 hours of use."
Fast shipping and brand new
I Love cellphone moto X.
does not work.
Bought this for my husband and he has been so happy with it. Will probably buy the next model when it is time to replace it. And we are using it on Straight Talk with a Sim Card
No good try to contact for returning items no respond .
"When my last phone died, I picked this one with very little research (just a quick scan of Amazon reviews) and I'm glad I did! I wanted to resist the cult of iPhone and was very disappointed with my last phone, a Samsung. This one has been great so far--fast, nicely shaped and sized, and sturdy (I bought a cheap case and have dropped it a few times and it's been fine). I'm not a heavy smartphone user, but when I do need to go on-line or use one of the handful of apps that I like, it's never failed me in the 2+ months that I've owned. I recently found out that my engineer nephew, who is much younger and more tech-savvy than I am, picked a Motorola after thorough research. Not sure why this brand doesn't get more buzz!"
Excellent condition
Nice
"Great phone but I ha to get a different sim card from Verizon because requires a nano sim card instead of a micro sim card. But the phone I received had a weird stain on the back, idk, and the speaker made this weird crackling noise, I thought the phone might be water damaged, but the phone itself is really nice. It runs 5.1 lollipop after updating it from KitKat, lollipop update runs smooth as butter on the phone.OK let's talk about the camera. The quality isn't 4k but it gets the job done, the camera runs really smooth and has great photo editing tools. One of my favorite features of this phone is, if you twist the phone twice, it automatically turns the camera on, its great for when you want to get a quick pic.Other features are the voice activation feature, you can name your phone what you want. Also when you say the name it automatically starts the voice control, even when the phone is on standby. I use the feature all the time for directions, music, and just to ask questions.Build QualityThe phone is very solid and feels really nice in the hand. I don't use a case and I've dropped it a few times and yet no cracks. But I recommend a case and a screen protector. Like I said before it looks like a small iPhone 6 but smaller. Most people like big phones but this phone is perfect size for my hand. I can text comfortable with only one hand (unlike iphone 6) and just feels good.The reason I dropped it a star I because the specific phone I got had some flaws and the seller didn't tell about them. Like I think it has water damage because the phone makes these weird crackling noises sometimes. And theres a weird stain on the back that won't come off. Even with alcohol wipes lol.The price is really good for this phone. This phone runs the same software as 600 $ phones!Overall I would buy this again. Love the phone. I hope this review was helpful. If you have any questions I'll answer them!!Below are the front and rear camera picture qualities."
"Speaker while using phone doesn't work, forward facing camera not working either."
It works well.
Had many network issues with this phone. Not sure what the problem is but I only bought it for application testing. The network issues made it not particularly good for that
"Phone only recognizes movement half the time, like trying to hang up from a call. Have to hit the power button off and on to hang up. Programming is not as user friendly as other phones I've had."
"For the price of this item, it works exceptionally. The reason I am withholding the 5th star in the rating is due to the camera/gallery app--it fails just a bit too frequently and I have not been able figure out why. A message will pop-up (I can't think of the error off the top of my head) and the apps will close. This occurs when trying to use the camera, view images in the gallery, and edit photos. Restarting the device typically resolves the issue.Other than that, the item runs apps well and has stood up to normal wear and tear (in an OtterBox commuter series case)."
I got this for my daughter that lives out of state she took it to a store that said it was not unlocked she took it to another store and they told her that kind of phone would work for calls overseas and would be touch and go for other calls.I'm not sure what all was said but she is not using . She said she would try another store but not right away
"I really like this phone except for one thing. This says the phone is an unlocked GSM phone. I have T-Mobile account. I have their app on my phone. So, can someone tell me why this comes installed with Verizon??? I can not delete the Verizon apps. Believe me I've tried! Now, I get getting requests to set up my Verizon account.Can anything be done to get Verizon off my phone?Why does the product information for this phone not say it comes with Verizon on board?"
I love this phone. It does everything I wanted it to do. Its a great little smart phone that is easy to use and fun to look at. Coming from a geek I have to say this phone impressed me. The design is awesome because of its rounded back with a little dimple. It also has a stacked battery. The internals of it is fantastic. Its a solid phone with a rubber back and very comfortable in the hand. The only negative is the placement of the headphone jack on the top. That's minor problem and also my preference of placement on the phone. The phone has three microphones for noise cancellation which is fantastic for sound. I have had the phone for a couple weeks now and I am super happy with the response time and battery life of this phone. This is a great little phone and I recommend
Goos purchase
Waited a month to see if the phone was as described. I like the phone and it's functions even though it is 2 years old. This phone works well and very smoothly. I will have to replace the battery though. Seller offered to replace battery and stated they would pay for shipping.. Can't be without the phone as it is essential to my business.
This is very good smartfon.

"Speaker while using phone doesn't work, forward facing camera not working either."
It works well.
"It came with Verizon SIM. It works with t-mobile initially. Later. It would take several dialing attempts to get connected. It is annoying but acceptable. Overall, it is ok with the price."
"Nice little phone with great features. Some issues connecting 4G LTE initially, but a couple of updates and reboots cleared those up. Overall, I'm happy with it."
Great phone. Very durable and easy to fit in pocket. Ships with an older operating system so it requires a ton of updates.
The phone arrived on time and the phone was as stated. Couldn't be happier and it was easy to set up for Verizon.
"I am technology challenged. The Moyo X is idiot proof. Camera is great, hands free is awesome. Just had surgery on rite arm (am rite handed). Even hands free is easy"
"This phone has a great UI, is very fast, and fits nicely in a pocket.For me, though, the best feature is that it is unlocked and is both a CDMA and a GSM phone. That means you can use it with any GSM carrier by adding a sim card. I'm not sure if it will work with CDMA carriers other then Verizon or not.I've used mine with Verizon, T-Mobile, and MetroPCS. I took it to Europe. I could have popped in any of the European sims, but it actually worked fine in Paris with T-Mobile. The data access is a little slow, so I wouldn't want to navigate in a car with it, but on foot, it was fine. T-mobile will also let you buy faster data overseas if you need it.You do see the Verizon splash screen it boots up and on GSM, there's a message about it having a foreign sim card, but it has always worked fine for me.As far as I can tell, it has all the bands necessary to use it just about anywhere in the world."
thanks!!
"Be aware before you buy....this phone might not work with the Carrier you want to use. It arrived quickly, seems to be brand new in unopened package. Even though it says GSM in the description, mine arrived with Verizon on the back. I tried to use it with Ting, but it was rejected. Evidently Ting has an agreement with Sprint to only use their branded phones. Your BYOD to Ting must pass through the Sprint checker, and it rejected this phone. So now I might have to use StraightTalk or Page Plus. Those are ok, but not what I wanted...Ting. Be aware that you cannot BYOD to Republic. Do your research upfront!"
All right. No problems.
"Needed a replacement phone quick and this was a perfect fit. So far, so good. I am a Verizon customer and there were no problems activating it. The phone is new and came in a sealed box with sim card, sim card remover and a charger. I like the slimness of the phone but being as it feels a bit more fragile than my previous Samsung, I also purchased a case and tempered glass screen protector."
"The phone itself was great and I love the Moto X. Unfortunately the phone was not properly unlocked for use on a GSM network. It worked with problems initially -- calls being dropped, cell coverage coming in and out... but after about a month its ability to text ended completely. T-Mobile could see the phone, but it kept constantly knocking itself off their network. I contacted the sellers, but they were ignorant (thought T-Mobile was part of Sprint) and unhelpful. They were not willing to give me a return and I was hoping to swap it for another phone that was properly unlocked -- didn't want my money back, just a properly working phone. I recomend the phone, but ""satisfaction guaranteed"" is a misnomer."
The Moto X I received was exactly as it was represented. Like new condition. And I was able to upload Lollipop 5.0 with no problems. Very satisfied.
"I bought it to use it in Argentina. It works but i had some issues. First of all to update android i need to do it throught my Pc with a verizone tool. Now it works very good but when I call to my cellphone provider (Claro) #611 it calls to verizone in USA. And when I lose a phone call and i press the option ""call back"" it adds automatically a +1 in front of the number to call to USA. So it says number doesn't exist. I need to look in contact list and have the numbers set up with +54 in the front. For these last 2 errors I couldn't find a solution yet."
"Not a new phone, did not come with sim card, or card changer. I had checked off ""new"" on the amazon sidebar, so I thought it would be a new phone. I will check back in with how it actually performs, if I can get it running."
"Great phone at first, and I had no problems with Verizon, but it only lasted 3 months. Now it won't turn on."
Works as promised.
Great phone!! Smaller than most but I like that!
very good
As promised. Gen 1 Moto X. Cheaper than fixing a broken screen for $150+
"I have had bad luck with ordering mobile phones through Amazon! I ordered this Motorola MOTO S ST1060 on July 15, 2015. The phone worked the first month but the MOTO phone stopped being able to receive of place calls after that first month. I could only use the message function. Now the phone has completely stopped working. (The phone has not been dropped or gotten wet) Since I purchased this phone on July 15, 2015 it is no longer returnable. To be fair to the brand another member of our family has had his MOTO X phone for almost two years and has not had any issues. The non-problematic MOTO phone was purchased at the Verizon store, plus I am not sure it is the exact same model as this one that I purchased in July. Motorola MOTO X XT1060 16GB 4G LTE Verizon CDMA / Unlocked GSM Phone - White"
What I expected
"Great phone but it only will texting is a problem on TMobile network. Some times they go out other times not. Tmobile says that is because it is a ""Verizon phone"". Other than that huge flaw it is a good phone."
Excellent!
My son loves his Moto X. Works well on Selectel Wireless/Verizon network.
As advertised. Works with Selectel Wireless/Verizon network.
"It only got 1 star because I couldn't put 0. I have never cracked a screen on a phone ever in my life and the one time This phone dropped, the screen just shattered into pieces. I only had it for a day before it broke. My heart broke when the screen did. Saddest part of this whole thing is that there is no warranty and I just wasted $180"
"Phone is working fine, price quite convenient for performance."
ok
"I purchased this phone specifically to take from the U.S. and use overseas in the middle east. This phone is amazing! From the sound quality to taking pictures. It is a terrific phone! It worked with the cell phone carrier that was overseas with no problems at all. The mobile data runs smooth and quickly with apps. If you are looking for a quality, name brand, unlocked cell phone...this is a great device to get. Not only did it work overseas for me, now I can use it right here in the States with my current cell provider.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"I bought this for a friend. Verizon had to send a new SIM, which they did at no cost. Registering it on Verizon was easy enough. It was a nice, inexpensive upgrade from an entry-level Moto Android phone. Bigger screen, more storage, faster CPU, and LTE. A great value if you're stuck on Verizon."
"Bought this as a replacement phone for the wife. Okay replacement, but, poor battery life."
"great phone,great price,always!"
Nice phone for the money. Does everything I expect it to.
The phone was like new. You could not make a difference. Thanks!

"I just received the device, it came in the original sealed box, it seems new and it has the Verizon SIM card. Couldn't test it too much yet, but so far, everything is ok.I've a question though, I'm not from the US and I have no Verizon account nor any contract with any carrier in this country. As soon as I turned on my device I was connected to 4G through Verizon network. Will I be charged in any way for this? Do I have some kind of prepaid credit which I can use in the US till it expires?thanks!"
Absolutely love my Moto X phone! Everything I wanted it to be. Waiting for the lollipop upgrade and was told it would be uploaded automatically. Always been a Motorola girl and they continue to excel while being affordable versus the more expensive options on the market.
"Very disappointed. I was looking for an AT&T compatible phone. This is advertised as an unlocked GSM phone (which is compatible), but I received a Verizon phone, which is CDMA. It ""works"", but a lot of the functionality does not work, it has low bars of service, and is on an "" H"" network rather than 4G LTE. The phone I received even had the name Verizon written across it, which is not as advertised."
"Verizon simply sucks! You can't use the phone at all! No matter what sim card you put into it.Unless you go to verizon to activated The phone itself is great, but terrible if embedded with Verizon wireless! (XT1060) is not recommended at all..."
Works good. Battery lasts well. Fast. But it does not have the capability of a wi fi hotspot.
"Its a good phone, has to problem, you cannot change the battery (closed) and cannot input an sd card.I bought 2 of them and one has an error when its update de OS, is reparing it now because the ROM fail. I dont know if it has solution...."
"Just as expected...8/11/15 update... the radio transmitters on this unit are not working, so no wifi or bluetooth...will see if vendor offers a remedy"
"The phone itself is pretty good, but it sometimes alternates between having 5-bars and no signal until i reboot the phone, or activate and deactivate plane mode. This makes making a call very frustrating sometimes, and an annoyance when it interrupts a call in progress.There are also instances when after rebooting the phone shows a message saying the SIM comes from an unknown or incompatible source, but then it works again after a bit.This would've been a 4 or 5-star review if it were not for those issues because it's a great phone overall."
This phone was NEW! The packaging was perfect! I had no trouble activating with verizon! So pleased with my new phone.
I love this phone!
I previously had an LG G3 with Verizon. I didn't have insurance on it and I dropped it and broke it. I bought this phone as a replacement. It came quickly and was in original packaging unopened with charger. It's an awesome little phone. Everything worked out great and even though it's not as advanced as my LG G3 was I love it. It's a perfect size (about the size of an iphone5). After getting this phone I will likely stick to Motorola phones- great quality.
I love it! Came with SIM card ready to go on Verizon. This is the best phone I have ever used.
Very good phone for the price met expectations
"This phone is refurbished. So it works great so far (had it for a week). I just wished the listing would have stated that it was refurbished. This my second moto x.This one did not come in the factory original box and and came with a weird charger - the charger works but not as well as my original one. Also, it does not, again doesn't come with the Sim card tool that my factory original did."
My camera flash didn't work when I received the phone.
grat phone light slim works so fast with 4 g have to figure a few thigns out but not bad
"works great. just went to Verizon for a painless switch from the old phone. is much faster than the 2011 Motorola droid.BTW Verizon now offers good no-contract plans if you bring your own phone now. It now makes sense to buy a slightly older model phone yourself from Amazon, and avoid getting into a 2 year contract."
"Type of fabric that utterly clings! Otherwise, a nice product."
"A very good phone for the money if you're looking to buy a phone without contract! Service was excellent and no problems with the Moto X so far. Activating the phone was a breeze also, got it done without having to get the runaround of some customer service representative!"
The phone itself is very impressive yet my rate is due to the fact that it doesn't connect to my Wi-Fi router as well as Bluetooth as I have tried it on multiple sources. I will be returning this item and very upset because I actually liked the phone.
A+
One of the best android phones on the market especially for the price
Excelente
"This phone is old hat now, a new moto x is here, and the competition have all gone through update cycles, and whereas this device was middle of the road in terms of specs, it's updated version is not, therefore no need to get this phone.... Or so I thought.I have rarely been this wrong in my assessment.PERFORMANCE: The 2013 moto x absolutely flies! It is smooth, and fast. Apps launch pretty fast, and you won't notice the difference until you use it side by side with the latest devices (and who does that anyways?) Magnificent stock interface, that uses the 2 GB ram very efficiently, and keep an eye on 3rd party apps that may prevent the phone from sleeping.SCREEN: Pretty screen, that's only 720p but still draws oohs and aahs when in whip it out, despite the critiques of Amoled screens, I have found no fault with it. I love the saturated colors, I love the deep blacks, and it feels like the screen is painted directly on the glass. it becomes slightly difficult to read outdoors in bright sunlight occasionally, especially if you wear sunglasses.PHYSICAL: The phone itself is the perfect size, slim bezels and rounded back make it very ergonomic. The weight is well balanced and feels substantial and high quality and dense without feeling cumbersome.CAMERA: The camera isn't top of thee line in terms of performance, but it is good enough. And if you're patient enough you can get most excellent results from the optics. it is obvious when you use it that the lens was built to draw in more light, but that sometimes backfires, at night it becomes very noisy and the color balance trends to oscillate wildly in the dark unless you focus and expose it manually. During the day, the same lens often washes out colors if not focused properly. But if you manual focus, the picture is very good. Auto HDR is available as an option which automatically attempts to reduce this issue by merging multiple exposures into a 'perfect' exposure value. And while the HDR is a little aggressive, it works pretty well to mitigate these issues. The flash is bright but very cool in color. A SIDE NOTE: two stand out features of the camera that I found in my use were; 1. Most excellent macro capabilities (one of a kind) 2. The wrist twist gesture to launch the camera from sleep is quick and works like a charm, launching the camera mere moments later (life saver).SPEAKER/CALL QUALITY: The main speaker is loud and clear, but can get muffled occasionally if put on its back. But it has good clarity. The earpiece speaker is also clear and loud, and calls generally sounded crystal clear and without echoes or static.BATTERY LIFE: heavy user? You'll have to charge it 1.25 times daily. It is sufficient for about 12-14 hours of use. But you'll have to give it a short supplementary charge in the middle of the day. Moderate to light user? You'll get through the day easily, with about 15-16 hours of use."
Fast shipping and brand new
This phone met my expectations; my only problem with the selection of smartphones are that there are not enough CMDA smartphones for Verizon customers.
It works as expected like a new phone.
"Works fine, but Sprint is having a hard time activating it. So far it's just a wifi machine. Would also like to note that the headphone jack is not compatible with any nice headphones. It can only be used with TRS (2 rings) headphones, not TRRS (3 ring) connectors. VERY slow to charge."
"This a is a pretty good phone for the price. No real complaints, but no real compliments either."
"I had to do a system update when the phone arrived and it worked perfectly after that. A great value for the price.5 stars – I love it! It is awesome and I highly recommend everyone to purchase this product!4 stars – I like it, but there are some flaws but I would purchase again.3 stars - It was okay, but I would probably not buy it again unless there are no other options.2 stars – There may be worse products out there, but you can definitely find something better.1 star – I dislike the product, I wish I had not purchased it and will not recommend the product to others.If my review was helpful, I would appreciate your feedback by clicking the 'Yes' button below. Thanks!"
"The phone was suppose to be a new phone and when I received it , it was a used phone and wouldn't work."
We are on the Straighttalk plan on the Verizon network and this phone works flawlessly with Straighttalk. My family has three of these phones.
"Unit shipped as unlocked Moto-X, new in box (it was, no problem there), but proprietary software from Verizon makes phone not 100% compatible with other networks. Discovered the hard way, cannot send pic's nor multi-MMS. Seeking to return/exchange for a phone interoperable with AT&T."
Exellent product
Great phone
The product has a problem with de frontal camera. Delivery was excellent and on time.
"So far so good! I ordered this phone and it was delivered two days later. They said it could be up to a week but it arrived very fast. Looks brand new and seems to work just fine. I will get the SIM card installed today and if everything goes according to plan I will come back and update my review to 5 stars. I had a phone just like this one for about two years which I accidentally destroyed last weekend. They don't make 'em like this anymore. They are all ""phablets"" now, which I cannot stand. If you want a decent smartphone that you can use with one hand, this is an excellent choice and I have been quite pleased with this seller."
It worked in Argentina as expected
I was very pleased with this phone. Came brand new in package. Worked great with straight talk!! 5 stat for sure!!! It's fast and perfect size :)
excellent
"Poor battery, the signal difference"
"This phone is a good phone, I can surf the web fine and it can call fine too. However, it can't always send a text for me. I tried switching carriers, but the problem still wasn't fixed. Everything about the phone is good, but it just can barely text. I always get a message saying, ""The message failed to send. Touch to review the message."" There were some places that I could send messages from and some places that I could not. Most times I had 3 or 4 bars and the message still wouldn't send. I'm taking it to the store to get it fixed, I hope I can be able to text."
says it works for tmobile but had nothing issues trying to keep the phone on the correct band for LTE. Not for tmobile!
This low rate is for the seller not the product. This is not a new seald phone and it is not unlocked as described. It is used and did not work with my Tmobile sim card. it says it is a verizon phone all over it.
"Marked as GSM, was a Verizon-only CDMA phone."
"The phone itself was great and I love the Moto X. Unfortunately the phone was not properly unlocked for use on a GSM network. It worked with problems initially -- calls being dropped, cell coverage coming in and out... but after about a month its ability to text ended completely. T-Mobile could see the phone, but it kept constantly knocking itself off their network. I contacted the sellers, but they were ignorant (thought T-Mobile was part of Sprint) and unhelpful. They were not willing to give me a return and I was hoping to swap it for another phone that was properly unlocked -- didn't want my money back, just a properly working phone. I recomend the phone, but ""satisfaction guaranteed"" is a misnomer."
The Moto X I received was exactly as it was represented. Like new condition. And I was able to upload Lollipop 5.0 with no problems. Very satisfied.
"I bought it to use it in Argentina. It works but i had some issues. First of all to update android i need to do it throught my Pc with a verizone tool. Now it works very good but when I call to my cellphone provider (Claro) #611 it calls to verizone in USA. And when I lose a phone call and i press the option ""call back"" it adds automatically a +1 in front of the number to call to USA. So it says number doesn't exist. I need to look in contact list and have the numbers set up with +54 in the front. For these last 2 errors I couldn't find a solution yet."
"Not a new phone, did not come with sim card, or card changer. I had checked off ""new"" on the amazon sidebar, so I thought it would be a new phone. I will check back in with how it actually performs, if I can get it running."
"Great phone at first, and I had no problems with Verizon, but it only lasted 3 months. Now it won't turn on."
Works as promised.
Great phone!! Smaller than most but I like that!
very good
As promised. Gen 1 Moto X. Cheaper than fixing a broken screen for $150+
"I have had bad luck with ordering mobile phones through Amazon! I ordered this Motorola MOTO S ST1060 on July 15, 2015. The phone worked the first month but the MOTO phone stopped being able to receive of place calls after that first month. I could only use the message function. Now the phone has completely stopped working. (The phone has not been dropped or gotten wet) Since I purchased this phone on July 15, 2015 it is no longer returnable. To be fair to the brand another member of our family has had his MOTO X phone for almost two years and has not had any issues. The non-problematic MOTO phone was purchased at the Verizon store, plus I am not sure it is the exact same model as this one that I purchased in July. Motorola MOTO X XT1060 16GB 4G LTE Verizon CDMA / Unlocked GSM Phone - White"
Had many network issues with this phone. Not sure what the problem is but I only bought it for application testing. The network issues made it not particularly good for that
"Phone only recognizes movement half the time, like trying to hang up from a call. Have to hit the power button off and on to hang up. Programming is not as user friendly as other phones I've had."
"For the price of this item, it works exceptionally. The reason I am withholding the 5th star in the rating is due to the camera/gallery app--it fails just a bit too frequently and I have not been able figure out why. A message will pop-up (I can't think of the error off the top of my head) and the apps will close. This occurs when trying to use the camera, view images in the gallery, and edit photos. Restarting the device typically resolves the issue.Other than that, the item runs apps well and has stood up to normal wear and tear (in an OtterBox commuter series case)."
I got this for my daughter that lives out of state she took it to a store that said it was not unlocked she took it to another store and they told her that kind of phone would work for calls overseas and would be touch and go for other calls.I'm not sure what all was said but she is not using . She said she would try another store but not right away
"I really like this phone except for one thing. This says the phone is an unlocked GSM phone. I have T-Mobile account. I have their app on my phone. So, can someone tell me why this comes installed with Verizon??? I can not delete the Verizon apps. Believe me I've tried! Now, I get getting requests to set up my Verizon account.Can anything be done to get Verizon off my phone?Why does the product information for this phone not say it comes with Verizon on board?"
I love this phone. It does everything I wanted it to do. Its a great little smart phone that is easy to use and fun to look at. Coming from a geek I have to say this phone impressed me. The design is awesome because of its rounded back with a little dimple. It also has a stacked battery. The internals of it is fantastic. Its a solid phone with a rubber back and very comfortable in the hand. The only negative is the placement of the headphone jack on the top. That's minor problem and also my preference of placement on the phone. The phone has three microphones for noise cancellation which is fantastic for sound. I have had the phone for a couple weeks now and I am super happy with the response time and battery life of this phone. This is a great little phone and I recommend
Goos purchase
Waited a month to see if the phone was as described. I like the phone and it's functions even though it is 2 years old. This phone works well and very smoothly. I will have to replace the battery though. Seller offered to replace battery and stated they would pay for shipping.. Can't be without the phone as it is essential to my business.
This is very good smartfon.
returned this item
Great seller! Item as described. Highly recommend!
I received an XT1058 in an odd box (not the original Motorola Box) which makes me think this is not a new phone. The XT1058 does NOT work on Verizon! The phone I received even has AT&T branding on the back of it. The seller needs to either ship the correct item or change the item description. Think stinks because I was counting on having this phone for my wife before our vacation tomorrow and now I have no phone for her. I would not recommend this seller.
"It came with Verizon SIM. It works with t-mobile initially. Later. It would take several dialing attempts to get connected. It is annoying but acceptable. Overall, it is ok with the price."
"Nice little phone with great features. Some issues connecting 4G LTE initially, but a couple of updates and reboots cleared those up. Overall, I'm happy with it."
Great phone. Very durable and easy to fit in pocket. Ships with an older operating system so it requires a ton of updates.
The phone arrived on time and the phone was as stated. Couldn't be happier and it was easy to set up for Verizon.
"I am technology challenged. The Moyo X is idiot proof. Camera is great, hands free is awesome. Just had surgery on rite arm (am rite handed). Even hands free is easy"
"This phone has a great UI, is very fast, and fits nicely in a pocket.For me, though, the best feature is that it is unlocked and is both a CDMA and a GSM phone. That means you can use it with any GSM carrier by adding a sim card. I'm not sure if it will work with CDMA carriers other then Verizon or not.I've used mine with Verizon, T-Mobile, and MetroPCS. I took it to Europe. I could have popped in any of the European sims, but it actually worked fine in Paris with T-Mobile. The data access is a little slow, so I wouldn't want to navigate in a car with it, but on foot, it was fine. T-mobile will also let you buy faster data overseas if you need it.You do see the Verizon splash screen it boots up and on GSM, there's a message about it having a foreign sim card, but it has always worked fine for me.As far as I can tell, it has all the bands necessary to use it just about anywhere in the world."
thanks!!
"Be aware before you buy....this phone might not work with the Carrier you want to use. It arrived quickly, seems to be brand new in unopened package. Even though it says GSM in the description, mine arrived with Verizon on the back. I tried to use it with Ting, but it was rejected. Evidently Ting has an agreement with Sprint to only use their branded phones. Your BYOD to Ting must pass through the Sprint checker, and it rejected this phone. So now I might have to use StraightTalk or Page Plus. Those are ok, but not what I wanted...Ting. Be aware that you cannot BYOD to Republic. Do your research upfront!"
All right. No problems.
"Needed a replacement phone quick and this was a perfect fit. So far, so good. I am a Verizon customer and there were no problems activating it. The phone is new and came in a sealed box with sim card, sim card remover and a charger. I like the slimness of the phone but being as it feels a bit more fragile than my previous Samsung, I also purchased a case and tempered glass screen protector."
Although this is an unlocked phone I have some problems with it on AT&T because it is a Verizon phone
"Good phone, work fine. Good camera"
"This is an awesome phone! Looks new and it has just the right size screen, not too big and not too small. Why aren't more manufacturers making this 4.7 inch size?. Everything works like a charm and the phone is nice to use.I think I will buy an extra one just in case this stops working. And at $85, it is not very expensive."
"'Certified Refurbished products are tested and certified to LOOK and work like new, with limited to no wear' - AmazonRemove the caps word and that sentence will make a lot more sense. But service opinion aside the phone is one hell of a product. Designed and assembled in the USA I expected nothing less. The phone looks sleek. It's got rubberized texture on the back for grip. AMOLED display gives out overly saturated colors but amazing nonetheless. One unique feature to the Moto X is Touchless Control. You can voice-trigger by asking Google anything or issue certain commands to it even while the phone's asleep. Overall still a good phone for a 3 year old device."
Very Very nice
"I bought two moto x xt1060, but after nearly two months of use, were damaged and there is no way to fix them. This has been the worst purchase I've done."
Nice as said
good
"This is an upgrade from my old Droid Bionic. Everything is faster and better looking. Loads apps in about 1/3 the time. Plenty of space with 16Gb. WiFi reception is worse (fewer bars compared to Bionic), but still works great. Bluetooth connects quickly and sounds great. Easy activation, went to a Verizon corporate store, got a new SIM card (Bionic SIM card was bigger, wouldn't fit in the MotoX) and walked out 5 minutes later with a much better phone. So far not a single hiccup at all. Awesome phone."
