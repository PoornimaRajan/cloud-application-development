"Received the phone yesterday and it is as expected. I haven't gotten the device soaked yet but it is fast, runs cool, and the display looks great even in direct daylight. Didn't get outrageously warm and the battery life looks like it will outperform what reviews led me to expect. I didn't really care about or want the finger print scanner so I am not torn up about that. The phone itself is understated ""chic"" I suppose. Its solid in the hand, has a nice little loop notch which was an unexpected surprise that will probably go unused here.I am particularly impressed with the headphone output on this phone. resolution and quality of output are on par with an HTC One M8. The M8 has the edge in absolute power output but this phone is capable of making good use of a Tidal account on the go. Has enough power to drive the Shure Srh-1840 to uncomfortable levels. Doesn't seem to mind hte ultra-low impedance of the Shure SE846 although absolute refinement of sound seems to take a slight hit compared to the HTC one M8. Four hours of Tidal streaming @ CD quality seemed to eat about 10% of the phones battery driving the SRH-1840 and the screen mostly off which I consider to be another solid showing.Especially for the money, I feel its quite a nice device."
I like the phone but the battery doesn't last long I had my phone off the charger for a half hour and it already lost 10% power
"i am a loyal Sony fan, using Sony phones since their W series of walkman phones, W700, W750I W850i, and then used xperia Z1, Z2, Z3, and now i got my hands on Xperia Z5. first of all i must confess xperia Z2 was the best xperia series phone till now. as far as Z5 is concerned, it is a typical Sony phone with awesome camera, 4k video, brilliant walkman and unbelievable bright resolution, but having said that, there is no WOW factor. nothing EXTRA ORDINARY new. And i don't blame sony for this. for couple of years, Android cellphones industry is in static situation and nothing new or awesome is coming out. every renowned brand's flagship phones are circling around, camera, water proof, sound, finger prints, resolution etc. nothing special or extra ordinary coming out. i gave 4 stars because battery life is not improved, i was expecting better performance in battery life."
"I have HTC for eight years, is my first Sony. Is a rocket!!!!"
best phone I have had so far
"I'm a big gamer, and I don't need to go over those features for you for the thousandth time, but after deciding not to upgrade to the Sony Xperia Z3 or Z3+ due to the heating issues, and a couple other reasons, I drooled over the Xperia Z5 specs for months waiting to buy this phone in the U.S. with a warranty. I finally got it through Amazon, and this phone is absolutely blazing fast! However the number the Sony Guy provided me to purchase an additional warranty didn't pan out, I still feel this phone deserves a full 5 star review. The camera, the graphics, the power, The playstation integration for gamers, this phone is exactly what I have been waiting for to upgrade for my trusty Xperia Play R800 and I couldn't be happier. Unless of course it slid out into a PlayStation controller like the old R800's but the display, camera, and about everything else make this phone so vastly superior in every aspect. I'm not even mad the U.S. version didn't get a finger print scanner as there is a ton of apps for that, and that wasn't a selling point anyways for me. I am in love all over again with another great Xperia!"
"I have used Xperia z5 for one week now.Super camera. I now don't need to carry compact camera with me. Just aim and shoot with my Z5. Focus fast and no more blurry pictures. Display is sharp and clear even under bright California sky. Phone function is as great as expected. Web browsing is fast... I don't use my I-pad anymore. Sorry, I had to move to AT&T from Verizon... more than 15 years loyal customer."
Loving the phone so far. However reception isn't that great in certain areas. The camera is phenomenal for a phone.
"I absolutely love this phone! Huge upgrade from the Sony Xperia Z3V that I previously was using, so it is actually my first time using Lollipop and also many other features that the Z5 has to offer. Buttery Smooth performance along with speed and the camera is just amazing, so many great things about this phone that I can go on about. I have read that people are upset about Sony not including the fingerprint scanner from the power button which to me is not a big deal since I have not yet to use it on my previous devices so I honestly could care less of the feature and I also doubt that I would ever use it if it was included. However this phone is great and I am enjoying it."
"I am impressed with the quality of this phone,The Xperia Z5 display excellent color reproduction and sharpness, has an excellent image, the glass screen feels sturdy, the software and hardware environment respond quickly and smooth, I have been using continuously and has no overheating by the continued use of streaming as z3,The Xperia Z5 is very well put together, with Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back, an aluminum frame and rubber bumpers on the corners to help absorb shock if the phone is dropped,The camera has truly excellent auto-focus,regarding the battery of sony phone I do not see a big difference compared to other phones like Samsung or IPhone S6,but The biggest departure in design terms, is the look of the power button. Sony’s trademark protruding chrome-effect circle, which has been around for years, has now been replaced by an elongated lozenge, slightly inset from the edge to prevent you accidentally pressing it.I particularly recommend this phone to a friend."
Upgraded to this phone from a T-Mobile Xperia Z (3 1/2 years old) which was locked; therefore I'm using the unlocked Z5 on T-Mobile and have not had any issues. I have a LTE signal on the device. One of the biggest pros for the phone is that its nearly stock android and all apps except a few can be removed completely from the device (for example i was able to remove the Google+ app which i was unable to do before). The phone is fast and fluid and i have not had any lagg on it. For me the camera is superb but I'm not a big photographer unless I'm at a concert or something. The auto-focus is extremely fast to where i don't even see it focus unless i manually use my finger to focus on a particular item. No regrets with my purchase
Bad signal. Screen froze. Had it for 1 day and it was restarting and acting stupid... Nice camera but shoddy phone.
"the phone get very hot, the last sony xperia 1 did not get hot. do you have any suggestion to solving this problem?"
Great phone. Works just fine outside the US
good :) perfect ;)
Device Arrive without headphones
Great phone with excellent build quality. Love having an unlocked phone with no carrier bloatware. It is a little on the big side for me and it is especially noticeable with the squared off shape of the phone.
"I love the phone but after a week having the Xperia Z5 I'm experiencing an issue with the touch screen. When I go to unlock the phone, the emergency call screen will pop up then once I have the phone unlocked, the phone will open up multiple icons by itself. the touch screen is going haywire, I turned my phone on and off countless of times and it still opens up random apps without me touching the screen."
It's an amazing phone!
Amazing cellphone
"This is an amazing phone! Although Version buyers beware, this phone does not support CDMA, same as Sprint. I ended up switching carriers but I needed to anyway. Besides that I love this phone, I had an IPhone 6 and I'm already forgetting about it."
Very cool phone water proof and nfc and other black megic Sony is very good company
"Great phone, I just couldn't get past my love of the iPhone and adjust to Android. The camera on this phone does some amazing things."
Awesome phone
"This replaced a 6 month old Samsung Galaxy Note 5. I did the MM software update, 6.0. set it up for my needs and have used it since. I have had zero problems, zero overheating. It is much faster & has better battery life than my Samsung. Possibly because it is not loaded with AT&T bloatware. But, I could not be happier."
Amazing and flawless.
I got the Z5 for the bigger screen and longer battery life. So far my phone is performing to my expectations.
"Having been a apple owner and recently used the Galaxy S4,S5,S6. I can say this phone is right with them. Been using it for around 5 days and love it. Strongly suggest this phone to anyone. The build is what I love the most. Very elegant design."
Very good phone everything is very quick and easy to use and I have had no problems so far.Edit: After a long time of use I began to notice that if you use 4k or full hd 60fps recording the phone gets extremely hot and overheats. Actually no its not just those two even if you open or use an app for a long time it overheats and this is a problem i've noticed in all xperia phones which is disappoint considering I absolutely love everything else about them. If this issue is fixed then this phone would be perfect but other than that nothing else has gave me problems.
"Coming from a Z3, I had very very high expectations, but due to the recent development of a flickering display issue, I decided to give the Z5 a chance.Within 3 hours of arrival, and fresh off a system update, the phone was shutting down the camera app due to thermal issues, and I was getting notifications about temperature problems. Whether I was taking 8mp images or 60fps full hd, same problem. If a phone's primary advertising feature is its camera's capabilities, those features should work.The display has a very odd tint to it, making whites appear red/purple, and giving other colors a weird cast, regardless of the xreality settings...maybe they put too much red in their Triluminos display technology...Adjusting the color calibration brings it closer to white, but gives things a greyish cast as well.While attempting to charge the phone using the supplied adapter, it was discharging faster than it could charge...all I was doing was downloading apps through google play, and had the screen on.Maybe I just got a dud, but Sony support killed it for me when their only solution was to check the return policy of the store from which I purchased, and then get sarcastic with me when I asked if that's all they were able to suggest.If this were priced as a midrange phone, I'd be more lenient, but at more than half a grand this is just unacceptable.Given that Sony has shuddered direct US sales of this phone, and their support is all overseas, I think I'm done with Sony Mobile. Too bad, too, cause the Z3 really was incredible."
I like the phone but the battery doesn't last long I had my phone off the charger for a half hour and it already lost 10% power
Severe fever
"I was looking for a phone that had an aluminum body and was water resistant. I also wanted an unlocked phone because I do tend to leave the states every once and a while. I've had it about a month now and I am very please with it - the phone feels solid in your hand, it has a great weight to it. The camera is AWESOME with the quick auto-focus feature, the pictures are beautiful with a 23MP camera. The battery life is pretty good too, and it charges pretty quickly when using the factory charger, so if you're on the go you can squeeze in a few hours of battery life with 15 minutes of charging.I was a little apprehensive that the screen isn't gorilla glass; my screens tend to crack over time, which is why a screen protector and case were a MUST! This phone is SOLID, it does have a little software quirks since it is unlocked - like a 'Cell Information' notification that can be a bit of a pain to keep off the notification bar (If you want to remove it you have to go to Settings->Sound and Notifications->App Notifications->Cell Information->click on the i in a circle-> Force Stop -- the notification will come back upon restart); a small Snapchat quirk that makes you do a bit of extra work to get to the right screen (some of the menu options dont function on certain screens, you have to go to the main camera screen before being able to see other people's stories). I am sure there are other small app quirks too, but these small quirks are easy for me to look over for a great water-resistant aluminum bodied unlocked smartphone that costs under 500 bucks. Recommended for those that like solid unlocked android phones. Slap a screen protector on it, get a case, and live yo life like a boss with a new phone."
"Excellent product, well packed and shiped."
"All is perfect, thank"
Gets too hot and battery life doesn't last more than 6 hours
"The best phone I've had since my XPERIA Z3! Sony knows how to make a beautiful, speedy, and premium-looking device. If you're looking for an Android-based phone, look no further, the XPERIA Z5 is the best I've had yet!"
"Awesome phone. The camera is probably one of the best available. Only problem is that it is the most delicate mobile phone on the market. The phone fell out of my pants pocket, and even with a case, the screen cracked. I have had iPhones and Galaxy phones in the past that have survived many falls with zero issues, but this Sony was unable to endure one fall. Sony has a great product, but they cheaped out on the screen. I called Sony to see if I could pay them for the repair, taking full responsibility for the drop, but the phone rep stated that they do not do out-of-warranty work for US customers."
The product has failed and I have no solutions by the seller !!!!!.Too bad all !!!!!. When not working no response from seller !!!
"Nice phone, the only thing is that it does not include headphones."
"The best Android experience that's not a Nexus phone. Great, if not awesome, audio and video quality."
"Extremely happy with this phone. It was finally time to upgrade from my Xperia TL, and when I got a chance to try out the Z5 I was more than satisfied. I'm on a family plan with phones including an Iphone 6 and a Samsung Galaxy 7, and I definitely preferred the Z5. Super fast camera with the best image sensor I've seen (also excellent in low light), a super sharp display-even in sunny conditions, super snappy operation and just an overall premium feel. I hope that Sony can get their issues with US carriers sorted out because more people should have access to the excellent Xperia line of phones."
Love it. Got here quick works flawlessly. No complaints about the phone. Takes a bit to get used to from iPhone and typing/browsing still annoying but everything else superior. Doubt I'll be going back to iPhone.
"I have been a loyal Sony Xperia Z1S and Z3 user and wanted to upgrade to the Z5. Xperia Z5 crashed repeatedly during startup process and then continued to do so with minimal use, even trying to open main menu screens. Factory reset did not fix anything. Returned it within a day and I'll have to wait for the next model to see if they ironed out the kinks."
Seller 100% recommended. He complied with everything. !!!
"I felt obligated to leave a feedback because some of the negative and inaccurate reviews users were leaving led me to believe that this phone was not a good buy. I just had the all great and mighty Samsung S7 and I absolutely hated the phone! It ran a bit sluggish, in addition, out of the box the battery was horrible, and I am coming from the Sony Xperia Z3 which I only had to charge once a day. I returned the S7 $800 paperweight that T-Mobile attempted to charge me and decided to purchase the Xperia Z5 since I loved the Z3 so much, but with some of the negative reviews I almost did not purchased the phone. I am so happy that I did not listen to the negative reviews and did it. It has been less than 24hours and this phone is absolutely amazing! I have it running on T-Mobile’s sim card and the service is great, no overheating, in addition I purchased a solid case to keep this amazing phone protected. I think that this is the best phone on the market right now and I wish that people would provide accurate feedback so that others who want to take a chance will also have an amazing experience as I am having. Please, if you are thinking about this phone and already know how solid Sony is, don’t get despair by the negative reviews, take a chance on a brand that you know and get the phone! Life is too short to just settle for anything, treat yourself and live your life!"
"Coming from a Galaxy S3 (with Zerolemon extended battery) that lasted 3+ years, the difference between the two phones is night and day. Definitely larger, less curvy, and thinner. The Z5 feels very premium if not a little on the fragile side. I've heard reports in the past (especially with the Z3) of the screens self-cracking, so I wasn't going to take any chances with this phone. I also ordered a tempered glass screen protector and a clear TPU case and threw those on before anything else.It's only been a few days, and these are my observations thus far:Spent the first two days playing with the Z5 and updating it. An update was available right out of the box. This can be done either through the phone itself or by connecting it to the computer and installing Sony's Xperia Companion software (which I didn't mind.) There were a lot of features to play with. Won't be getting bored any time soon. One thing to note: the volume buttons are on the lower-right side of the phone, as opposed to the Galaxy S3's upper-left side. It takes some getting used to. Some have said that it's simply poor placement, but it's really not that bad. It might be annoying if you're right-handed, but I could see left-handers having an easier time. It's left-hander friendly! And for the record, I could care less about the lack of fingerprint scanner support. I don't think it's a needed feature, and definitely not a deal-breaker. My S3 didn't have one, so I don't believe I'm missing out.Today was my first real day of having it in my pocket while at work. I don't wear tight pants, but the phone is thinner than what I'm used to, so I remained aware of the potential of it bending in my pocket. I charged the phone overnight to 100%. As of this writing (around 4:13 PM), I'm down to 76%. Granted, I wasn't using the camera heavily or playing any games yet or had the screen on for a prolonged period of time. But as it stands, I can easily get two days out of this thing.Here's something of interest: I guess Android 6.0 has a feature called ""Double-tap to Wake"", where you can simply double-tap the display and it'll come on so you can unlock the device from there. Very nice feature! I always think that I'm wearing down the power button with the constant screen turning on and off. BUT, over the course of the work day and having the phone in my pocket, I noticed on two occasions that the flashlight mode was shining in my pocket. Somehow, it enabled itself in my pocket and I know I locked the device. I also noticed that my bluetooth was on, and I had no recollection of turning that on as well. I suspect that the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature is so sensitive that it's turning on in my pocket, sliding around, and sliding the notification bar down and pressing random settings off and on. Even in my pocket, the screen must be very sensitive! There's apparently a ""Glove mode"" that makes it easier to interact with the screen while wearing gloves. This mode was turned off. I've since turned off the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature. I'll report back if I'm still having issues with this."
"Love it best smartphone in the market and the cámara it's amazing. It's better than a IPhone 6S Plus ;) 📷📲👌Sony make it big again, they ate doing Better :3 <3"
"Phone is good and has good uniformity over other Android phone, but falls short of iPhone uniformity. Touch sensitivity isn't perfect, nor is the keyboard very good. Language support is poor; keyboards available for only east Asian languages.Otherwise, aesthetically pleasing."
"GOOD QUALITY, HAPPY"
Bad signal. Screen froze. Had it for 1 day and it was restarting and acting stupid... Nice camera but shoddy phone.
Wifi and service sucks through this phone for some reason. Probably won't buy another one.
"Even when this item is sold as ""New"" the box was open and dirty, as when it has been manipulated by several hands, the cell phone plastic cover was from other cell phone because it was shorter and in different shape. When I turned on the cell it started to update some apps, which is normal, and it was trying to update the software version, the cell phone tried several times without success, I had to do it using my computer. Definitely not recommended for people who likes products just ""plug and play"". The cell phone by itself is really good."
I have only had Sony cell phones for over 10 years. Nice phone and very happy with this purchase.
I love it. The purchase was easy the delivery fast
"Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White, EXCELENTE PRODUCTO"
"I got this for its waterproof features, and it is still amazing for a year-old model."
I have seen in the phone problem
Love it
"This is a really solid no nonsense phone , the user interface is great, the camera/video is fantastic, its got the latest software, the sound quality is Surprisingly clear and sharp.If your looking for an alternative to apple/Samsung that matches all the specs Sony has a winner with this phone, I would highly recommend"
"Phone is awesome!! Fast response, vibrant screen, great camera and very nice native apps. Been confronting some battery life issues... But it appears to be software behavior, hardware is perfectly good."
"This review is after 3 months of ownership:The first few weeks I was pleased with the phone in general. All the basic performance requirements of a phone at the price point were met. After a few months of use, there have been some significant issues and I am now at a point where I need to replace the device all together. This is really disappointing because I usually get 2 to 3 product cycles out of a phone;I bought this to replace my S5 Galaxy. Here is a chronological list of issues developing1) 1 week - Blue tooth connectivity/call prioritization. Improved after system update2) 1 month - Overheating issues &coating on lens started to scratch off... The camera quality suffered as a result.3) 2 months - Vertical lines in the display when first turned on, that would fade away.4) 3 months - Vertical lines became like looking through a mesh, eventually the screen completely failed. It just displays lines and shades.I hope this helps, don't make the same mistake: buy a Samsung S7"
I've always been a fan of Sony but after this purchase my opinion changed! I just bought it in May 13th and for no reason it stopped working yesterday. It had 50% battery life and out of the blue it just blacked out and I was never able to turn it on again. I am in U.S. for a limited period of time to visit my family and it is so frustrating because all the memories I had with my family in this trip were gone with the phone.I would like to know what Amazon is going to do about it because I am leaving the country in a week and I feel completely deceived.
"I thought I gonna have earing kit, but no. The phone is good. Before I was using Xperia Z, this one is just perfect"
One of the best phones I have owned it is definitely a choice for android users who want something like Iphone but without their apps etc.
Phone is VERY slooooooow. Battery life is very poor. I never make it through the day. Just ordered a OnePlus 3.
"I really thought this cellphone was going to meet my expectations , but the camera isnt different from a Samsung Galaxy 5s,I had a doubt before i purchase this phone between LG5 and this one, and after reading all the descriptions and comparing i decided to get this one but now i dont even know if i made the right choice."
very good product

"This new phone is driving me and everyone whoever tried to turn it on crazy! I am a huge sony fan, and believe me when I say I received a piece of crap! I've got it for about a week, now I can't even call it a phone! It is a USELESS METAL PAD with a red flash. It keeps crushing and rebooting for no reason, it sometimes even crush and reboots during former reboot!! So far, I only succeed at sending one 10-word-long text message with multiple attempts. I can't believe how could the company let such crapy product goes into the market!"

Upgraded to this phone from a T-Mobile Xperia Z (3 1/2 years old) which was locked; therefore I'm using the unlocked Z5 on T-Mobile and have not had any issues. I have a LTE signal on the device.

Doesn't seem to mind hte ultra-low impedance of the Shure SE846 although absolute refinement of sound seems to take a slight hit compared to the HTC one M8. Four hours of Tidal streaming @ CD quality seemed to eat about 10% of the phones battery driving the SRH-1840 and the screen mostly off which I consider to be another solid showing.Especially for the money, I feel its quite a nice device."
"I've had a Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, and S4. I understand some people like big phones, however, that's not my preference. That's why when the S5 came out, I started looking for something else. Then I found the Sony's Xperia Z Compact phones. I had originally wanted the Z3+ (Z4 elsewhere), but right when I was about to buy it, the Z5 Compact came out. While it's not available in the US via normal retailers, I was able to get a warranty for it via SquareTrade. So that made it a no brainer for me. I've had it for a few months now and I'm still loving it."
"EDIT (1/9/16): My original evaluation of this phone remains the same but I would encourage people to look at the HTC One A9 as it addresses the US compatability aspect while still being pocketable. It is not as compact as the Z5c, meaning Sony is still the only name in the game but the A9 is still manageable. You can read my review here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B017D554UKI have been through every phone you can imagine and the Sony Xperia Compact line continues to impress me. I recently had a Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x and the sizes are just to much for me. Yes, I really want Marshmallow but can wait an extra few weeks for it. I asked a few questions before buying and had trouble getting clear information due to the technical nature, but wanted to clarify for those who are looking.This phone is almost fully compatible with T-Mobile USA and I can confirm Band 12 (Extended Range LTE) *does* work (confirmed with LTE Discovery). However, there is no HD Voice, VoLTE or WiFi Calling. For me, these trade-offs were well worth it because of the phenomenal battery life (which will likely get better on Marshmallow), the compact form factor and water resistance (just nice to have as a backup). If WiFi calling is an issue for you, you can use something like Hangouts phone calls as a backup. It is of course not as convenient, but it works. HD Voice is only compatible T-Mobile <> T-Mobile and, yes, you can tell the difference and I wish I had it - but again, not a huge trade-off. VoLTE is the one that gets me. For those of you that don't know, this means the phone drops your data down to 3G/HSPA when making a phone call. Not the end of the world but you may notice the difference when navigating, tethering to your PC, trying to navigate, etc. Again, you could get around this by using a third-party dialer (Hangouts) since that is a VoIP call but for most people, this may be overkill. I suspect though most people buying this phone are pretty familiar with these things since the phone is not advertised in the US. The lack of VoLTE/WiFi Calling/HD Voice is the only reason I knocked off a star.Note the phone comes with an international charger and adapter. It is compatible with QuickCharge technology and charges rapidly for example with this Swiftrans 3221263 Quick Charge 2.0 36W Dual Ports USB Car ChargerThe camera on the phone is pretty good - not the best - but will be fine for 9/10 people.I am using the phone with Aomax® For Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini Tempered Glass Screen Protector [Superslim 0.26mm,2.5D Round Edge,9H Hardness] [Retail Package] For(Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini) and Orzly® - FlexiSlim Case for SONY XPERIA Z5 COMPACT (2015 SmartPhone Model / Smallest Version / XPERIA Z5 MINI) - Super Slim (0.35mm) Protective Phone Cover in Semi Transparent WHITE. It was important to me I protected the device but didn't go overboard on the bulkiness - the combination of these two are perfect. I have reviewed each of these independently but included one picture here of the phone, glass and case together.Overall this is an awesome phone for people who aren't concerned about buying direct from a carrier and don't want a huge phone."
"This device heats up way too quickly and can get really hot. The fingerprint sensor is decent, although nothing compared to the accuracy and responsiveness of the nexus 5x sensor. I would've kept this phone if not for the thermal issues which is quite a defect in this phone."
"The phone looks great, I love the phone but no 4G or LTE on T-Mobile network. False advertising by the seller ( Mobile Front ) when they say "" Work GSM Network only Will NOT work with Sprint, Nextel, Verizon etc"" what is the point of buying LTE phone if it does not work!! . Note you will only get H+ on T-Mobile"
"An amazing phone! If you are in the US be prepared to run into small workable issues. I use AT&T and the company was great in supporting the unlocked phone, setting me up with a visit to the distribution office for the Nano-sim install and activation. The issues I am talking about is the distribution centers have no experience with this phone and had no idea how to move the data from my old Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) to the new phone, how to install the Nano Sim or the SD card. Since AT&T will not allow two phones to be active at the same time I could not download the Xperia App to the old phone --- you must do this prior to deactivating the old sim --- via Google play, a similar app is needed for Bluetooth transfer --- the only option to find and buy the Xperia data cable and try that. For those reading this and are thinking that all I have to do is to remove the SD card from the old Samsung Rugby which is also an Android device with all the latest updates. It doesn’t work, the Xperia Z5 compact rejected the phone contacts as not being in the right format. What the heck? The Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) does not use the *.vcf format and will not transfer to the Xperia.Even if I have to transfer all my contacts to my new Xperia Z5 Compact manually I’m willing to do so. This phone supports amazingly clear conversations using Bluetooth headset, speaker-phone, or near the face, the camera is outstanding. Even though there are complaints of the 780 display I don’t see it. I am very happy with a phone that is not tethered to a charging dock every few hours. I have to ask, if wireless means you are not connected to an RJ jack but are tethered to a charger all the time what is the difference? Bonus, with the reasonable screen size I do not have to hire a porter and baggage cart to haul it around, it fits into my pocket, imagine that!"
"I've always been an iPhone guy but Android phones have always intrigued me. I've had a lot of Android phones but none have really excited me all that much so I went back to Apple. I'm very happy with the Z 5 Compact and have finally found something to keep me away from my iPhone. This phone is built really well, looks sharp and is the perfect size.The phone is speedy, all wireless connections are sturdy and I love Sony's Android Skin."
"TL;DR PRO/CON list at bottom.I will start off this review by saying that I really wanted to love this phone. It does have some very good qualities about it. But the phone has its faults, which are enough for me to not give this phone a recommendation. I have used the phone for approximately 6 months.By background is that I worked in the cell phone industry selling phones for years, before moving into corporate IT and networking. I have been a amateur phone enthusiast and have easily had over 30 phones in my day. I also take exceptional care of my belongings, electronics getting special care. Seeing as this phone is a bit expensive for the size, it was a bit of a treat for myself as the specs and design looked like everything I wanted.HardwareScreen is a nice size for one handed use. Is very crisp and easy to see inside and outside in bright sunlight. Physical buttons are a tad awkward being so low on the device, but worked well for how I hold a phone. They provide enough click, but are a little hard to ""feel out"" and press during a call. Volume on the dual speakers is adequate for a small phone and produce decent sound. Sound through earphones is very good. 2 GB of RAM is more than enough to power the 720p screen and the 810 processor never lets up. The fingerprint scanner is top notch. Works very fast and recognizes fingers well. It allows 5 fingers to be registered. I did my wife's thumb, left index, right index, and my right thumb twice for better accuracy on my main digit. Sometimes I would pull the phone out of my pocket and it would already have registered my thumb and unlocked itself.UI, Performance, and Battery LifeThis phone came with Android Lollipop and is now updated to Marshmallow. The UI runs well. The fast processor and 2 GB of RAM don't let this phone slow down much if at all. Sony's take on Android is a very clean and minimal. Although there is plenty of Sony ""bloatware"" apps that come preinstalled and cannot be removed. You can ""disable"" them so they are no longer active and don't appear in the menu, but still live on the device. The Snapdragon 810 does still tend to get hot at random times. An app may be running in the background and you can feel the phone get much warmer. Never hot that you feel in danger, but warm enough to warranty a reboot in my opinion. Once back up the device was cool again. Battery life on the phone is decent, but not close to the expectation that Sony has set with previous devices in the series. It will get you through a day easily with moderate to heavy use, and can easily stretch to two days with light use. Recharge time however is very long. If you plug into a PC to charge expect at least 3 - 4 hours to charge it up. A quick charge adapter is a wise investment if you get this phone.Apps and GamingI largely got this phone for remote play on the PS4; that feature worked wonderfully with no issues. While the small screen was a little hard to see at times, I never had an issue with pairing the PS4 controller via bluetooth or playing over WiFi. The stock messaging app always gave me trouble with MMS messages, even with the correct settings from AT&T. I constantly got a you have an MMS to download message even though I already read the message. Textra fixed that issue and is a much better messaging app in my opinion. I don't really play any other types of mobile games, but companion apps for Destiny, Metal Gear Solid V, and standard apps like The Weather Channel all ran great on the device. As mentioned before there is A LOT of Sony branded items that are just flat out annoying and not needed.CameraWonderful camera. Loved to take pictures with this phone. They almost always come out clear and sharp. With the latest updates the camera opens quickly. The phone does a good job of fast auto-focus as promised. The shutter key on the side of the device is great for open the camera quickly and nice to take a picture. Finger placement while holding the phone is a bit awkward as the camera is very close the the top edge of the phone and gets covered easy if you are not careful. I spent most of my time in superior auto mode which produces 8 mp images. Going into manual will give you an overwhelming amount of options and allow full 23 mp pictures.DesignLooking at the phone it screams premium. Add waterproofing to the device and that is just piece of mind that some rain or accidental spills will not harm the device. No flap for the charge port is also wonderful as I've seen my share of them get damaged on phone such as the Galaxy S5 which kills the waterproofing of the device. The phone has a heafty weight to it that also feels good. The frosted glass back looks very nice and does not attract fingerprints. The phone is very slippery. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being course grit sand paper and 10 being metal coated in Teflon covered in olive oil, this phone is a 9 easy. The phone literally wants to slide out of your hand whenever you hold it. If nothing else a case is needed to provide some grip to the phone. Having a glass front and back also made me extra cautious and nervous about potential cracks. But I have always taken care of my devices and never cracked a screen.Phone callsPhone calls on the device were clean on my end every time. There were issues for the other caller especially when I used speaker phone. Callers would often complain that they heard themselves or that they could not hear me until I went back to the earpiece. It also appeared that using the speaker phone only used the bottom speaker and not both.DurabilityThis phone is by its very nature fragile. With over 90% of the outer casing being glass, you better believe this baby is delicate. The phone came with a pre-installed screen protector, but it became cruddy very fast. I normally don't use a screen protector and have never had an issue. I somehow managed to put a small scratch on the screen while it was in my pocket with NOTHING else in it one day while hiking. It was no big deal, as I couldn't see it when the screen was on, but I knew it was there and worried me that it got damaged so easily. Now just recently a friend placed my phone near a counter edge, and a got a few messages in a row that made the device vibrate right off the edge. Of course it landed face down on kitchen tile. Screen completely shattered and the touch screen stopped functioning altogether. I am not knocking this phone because of my stupid mistake, not many phones if any would survive a fall like that. Instead it just goes to show that a rugged case is just about required for this device. Which is a huge bummer since the phone looks so good.TL;DR and PROS/CONS ListPROS-- Nice screen for a smaller phone-- Beautiful design-- Great camera-- Fast performance-- Sony's UI has a good design-- Waterproof-- Native PS4 remote playCons-- Sony bloatware that cannot be removed, just disabled-- Slippery-- Fragile-- Poor speaker phone quality for the other caller-- Awkward button placement-- Very slow charge time-- Expensive-- Sony is slow to update UIConclusion and thoughtsThe phone is not worth the price. The camera is very nice and waterproofing is a big plus, but a few nice features do not outweigh the fact you are terrified to accidentally drop such an expensive phone. If you don't let anyone else touch this phone, and put it in a really hard-core case, it may last you a good while. If you live in the real world where you may leave you phone on a desk, give it to someone to take a picture of you, or bump into something with the phone in your pocket it may be dropped and will break."
Great phone. I replaced a Google nexus 5 with this. Wife already had the z3 compact. Easy decision.
DESIGN: greatPERFORMANCE: great.CAMERA: greatDISPLAY: mediocreFINGERPRINT SCANNER: unreliable
"great phone! fast, smoth, convenient size..."
Excellent phone! Had the Samsung Galaxy it is over rated. Sony has done an amazing job. Top quality
"This phone is exactly what I was looking for. More compact so I can actually hold and utilize it with one hand, still water proof for random spills and drops in the pool, and great photos!I had a little trouble at first because I forgot all of the little things one must do to get a network unbranded phone to work. Also, if you don't remove the plastic screen protector that comes on it in the box, it will disrupt your ear proximity sensor.Some things you'll have to check if you want full functionality of your phone will be your SMS service center number, APN access point network for Internet and Lte to work, network settings in general. All of this info is available online, so don't be deterred. It's very easy to just type in a couple of numbers and enjoy your new phone."
"If you're looking for a compact phone, this is the one to get. Compact size without sacrificing CPU and other features like most other ""mini"" phones. I am using this on AT&T in the USA.Pros:- Battery life is astounding. I usually go to bed with ~40% battery after a day of use.- Compact size - so awesome. Hate how big most phones are these days, this is the perfect size for me- Fast. ""Flagship"" phone specs but in a compact size.- Fingerprint scanner. Love this. I hate lock screens but I am required to use them for a few apps, and company policy. Fingerprint scanner works pretty well.- Smart lock - nice feature that is new to me. Auto-unlocks the phone based on certain conditions, such as if certain bluetooth devices are connected, by location (while at home for example) and/or other criteria. Makes having a lock screen much less of a pain.- Dedicated camera button, press and hold to power on the phone and open camera, nice for quick photos- Dual front-facing speakers. Very loud, sound is decent, a bit tinny, but that's expected from such a small device.- Great screen, very clear and bright, no complaints there- Did I mention it's tiny?Cons:- Camera is pretty mediocre. I'm not a big camera user but for some this may be a dealbreaker. My 4 year old HTC One M7 took far better pictures.- Now that I've had it several months, the fingerprint scanner is getting a little glitchy. Most of the time a reboot fixes the problem, but usually comes back after a couple days. Definitely annoying.- Case options are pretty limited, and many of them cover the power button therefore disabling the use of the fingerprint scanner.- 720p resolution. Honestly I don't consider this a downside at all, who wants to watch 1080p video on a 4"" screen anyway. But for some, resolution is important.- Personally I don't like the factory dialer. I almost always dial by number and this one pulls up a list of contacts by default and takes an extra tap to get the keypad. Slightly annoying, but easily fixed with 3rd-party dialers in the Play store.- Gorilla Glass. Hotly debated, but this phone doesn't have it. Sony uses their own proprietary tempered glass, supposedly just as scratch-resistant as Gorilla Glass. I've own the phone for 3 months now and have zero scratches, and survived a couple drops."
"Nice compact pocket sized phone. A very decent photo camera.Compared to my old Z1 compact, it's much better in every sense and at normal affordable price.The fingerprint opening works mostly ok and is quite useful"
"Stay away from this phone.I purchased this phone less than a year ago. From the beginning the phone was a little slow to respond in many ways but I could deal with it. About 3 months ago the camera stopped working entirely. I called customer support and was told to do a soft reset, then hard reset. Neither of those worked.I asked about sending the phone in for repair and was informed that because this model came from Hong Kong, that they could not repair it, it is not covered under warranty, I would have to contact the Hong Kong customer service. I have been back and forth between both Hong Kong and US customer service, both of them just give me the run around and refuse to take responsibility for their faulty product, and will not repair it. After contacting the US customer service again, they advised me to do a software repair. I followed the steps and now my phone is entirely stuck on the beginning intro screen and will not function at all. In other words, right now I paid over $500.00 for a non functioning phone with Sony refusing to fix their faulty product.This phone is a giant lemon, and after dealing with Sonys customer service I will never purchase a Sony product again."
"If you want an Android *phone* - not a mini-tablet, something that fits in your hand and doesn't feel like a plate of armor in your front pocket - Sony is now the only game in town (and not in any USA towns...these are imports). I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings.I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the ""lip"" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases.I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone.Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled.Just buy it. I hope Sony sells enough to make Z5 Compact successors."
"Love it. Had the z3 compact for one year and made the upgrade mainly for the fingerprint sensor that, although it's not as good as the one on the iphone 6s, works alright. Also, the camera is a bit better (though the one on the z3 compact was already something amazing) and... what else? overall it looks better, nicer, more premium feel to it ;) I miss magnetic charging though..."
"I have bought phone of white color. Excellent design, ideal size, powerful hardware! Only one drawback - at start of some power applications phone is heated. 9,5 points from 10."
"Nice Smartphone, excellent service. Great experience."
"I love this phone! The size is perfect. It fits in my pocket just fine. The ability to record in 4k is really cool and the quality of the video seems very very nice, even when just played back on the phones display. The display is very sharp and gave me a headache for a day or two but I seem to have adjusted now. Apps load very fast. I am using the At&t nano sim through straight talk and everything is working just fine.The only downside so far is the camera loads fairly slow. My boyfriends iPhone 6 loads the camera and takes six photos by the time this phone loads and takes one. Other than that I am overall pleased with the phone."
"I found that after using the phone's internet browser for just a few minutes, the phone started to get very hot until eventually it was too hot to comfortably handle. This should not happen. Perhaps my phone was defective. Has anyone else ever experienced this problem? I am sending the phone back, but am unfortunately responsible to pay return shipping fees. Hopefully they will not charge me a restocking fee..."
"Excellent device, no other words to describe it. Don't think too much, just get it!"
Pros: Looks Size Camera Battery Life Screen quality (PPI) Screen to bezel ratio Front facing speakers Charging speed Multi-color LED notification light User interface Customizable Fingerprint scanner Dedicated camera button Clicky buttons Build qualtiy Water and dust proof Fast and responsive Micro SD card expandable storageCons: Doesn't work with Verizon
"Absolutely love this phone - battery life isn't as long as my Z3C, but I have 1-2 days out of it regularly.Supports QC 2.0, which is pretty awesome. I like the refined waterproofing design.This phone doesn't seem to jump/slide off everything like my Z3C - but I used the Ringke Fusion case for it anyway.The fingerprint unlock is an excellent feature - can be a little problematic, but usually gets it right on the 2nd/3rd try.I have a 200Gb Sandisk MicroSD installed - just about the right amount for Music/Pictures/Maps."
"Faulty product. Wifi failed to work, returned immediately."
My cousin loved it
"This is a fantastic phone.Sony did an excellent job with the user environment. It's only a little customised from stock Android and isn't always trying to sell you stuff like a Samsung device. The bloatware isn't too bad either and can be disabled. Sony includes a free service to locate, lock, or wipe your lost phone. Also software to copy over your old data. Very useful.Battery life really is good. My first day, it lasted until night which is quite good doing all of the setup and playing around. Under normal usage I have about 40% left at the end of the day--Wow! STAMINA mode seems really usable too for special times when you need extra battery life.The phone is small and very portable. It's not wafer thin, probably because of a larger battery. I don't find the thickness to be too much. Of course, with the smaller size you get a smaller screen. Is it worth the trade-off? Only you can decide.Performance is fast and flawless, which is unparalleled in a small phone. It doesn't seem to get particularly hot.The screen looks beautiful and the pixel density is plenty.I love the fingerprint sensor! Works great and so conveniently located. It's a shame they couldn't include this feature on the US model. I had Android encrypt the device for security, no problems.Volume control buttons seemed oddly placed at first, but they are out of the way and how often do you use them? Not that much.Camera, although it could be improved, is very usable as a compact camera. Dedicated camera button is very nice. Picture quality good, shutter delay fair.Water and dust sealing should be on EVERY phone. Great how it doesn't have fiddly flaps to cover all the ports.Audio quality is excellent and seems better than my old Samsung phone.No US warranty is unfortunate. If it breaks, I plan to pay for any repairs. I can live with the risk as a trade-off for the fingerprint scanner.Earbuds were included; thank you, Sony.Included charger had the international prong setup and included adapter for US outlets. Works fine, I have other chargers that work just as fine. Sometime I'll probably pick up a Quick Charge 2.0 charger.Overall, a super package! I'm so happy with it."
"Although the specs are good on paper, software bugs stop this phone from performing the simplest of tasks correctly.Hardware and build wise this thing is great. Button layout is perfect for one hand use. Bezel space is small, front stereo speakers are cool.Software wise... This phone is a joke. I had low expectations going in but was surprised at how bad it really is. The camera sucks, theres no way to say it's good at anything. Stereo speakers on front aren't same volume so it's a rather odd sound when viewing videos. Luminosity of auto brightness is all over the place, all of the time. And then there's overheating. The 810 in here should have been called dragons breath because it leaves the phone inoperable at times. I haven't shot 4k video or even played games yet and it gets above 170 just browsing the web. Charging the phone gets it to about 140 also.. and if you get a phone call or have to actually touch the phone, you get burned.All in all,if you're not a heavy user or you are coming from an iPhone, you'll probably like it. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."
display flickers! great cell phone with a great cam and functionality but the screen issue is a major problem that happened 1 month after purchase. I don't recommend to buy this cell.it looks a bit like this [...]
"The phone is compact and responsive but two real issues that are really bothersome:1. In the middle of a phone call, there is a 10 to 15 second pause when I hear a noise and the other party can't hear me. It corrects itself but does the same thing again after a minute or two on the call. I need to disconnect and call numerous times on a long call.2. The camera is nothing great. My old Samsung S4 has a better camera, especially in low light conditions. This takes very grainy pictures.Terrible experience. Very disappointed with Sony."
"The weight and size of this phone are ideal in my opinion. It is also very very fast, water resistant, very good battery life, looks very good, unreal 4k video(tested and impressed... pausing the video looks like a photo even on a large monitor), has a clear sharp display, great audio and a fantastic (for a phone) camera. I loved my Sony ZL phone, got it wet so then went to the Z1 which is great but too big and heavy for me. This is the best phone out there for my needs right now and I believe this size of phone will make a huge comeback as it is truly ideal, great job Sony! (PS I am on T-Mobile and I don't think I am getting LTE but still quite fast and battery drain is not an issue)"
"Everything good with this buddy, although it crashes sometimes with snapchat and sometimes you wish the battery last longer (cause it should since it is 2600mAh) but its all what it says to be, so, we are good."
"This started out as an amazing device. Unfortunately, it did not end well. I am not going to list how amazing the phone is or the pros, the hardware specs already do. The problems with this phone are that it started to slow down over time because it began overheating. It becomes unresponsive and then apps crash. A separate issue is when it randomly reboots. This is unrelated to overheating. I honestly really like the device, but what's practical about an overheating supercar? Nothing. I remove 3 stars for overheating, software issues, and because they were severe enough that I had to return the device."
soooooooo ggggggoooooooooddddddd phone
"Excellent phone , the only one with a small screen (fits smaller hands) and a killer hardware/software combination. The camera is really good and the screen is super sharp. Truly excellent engineering work. My wife had iPhone 5s and a huawei p8 and this is beating them on the first round"
I am a fellow Sony Xperia z3 compact moving up to the z5 compact. Definitely a better phone. The LCD screen is definitely an improvement. The speakers are definitely louder. Fingerprint sensor works perfect. The 32 gigabytes of internal memory is also a plus due to all the apps that are out there that you may want or need. Camera definitely takes better pictures but I would not say it's a faster speed to take the picture
"A very well-designed and compact phone. I migrated to this from an HTC M8 one and I love that I can put the phone in my pocket now and not feel like it's awkward to sit or bend at the hip. It also feels speedier and is easy to hold: no slick, curved, and stylish-yet-impractical backplate here."
awesome!!!!
Very good
"Firstly, I don't often review products, and even less often am I this satisfied with a smartphone. As a consumer, I'm incredibly attentive to the small details in a product, and if the issue is annoying enough, I'll return it. Not so with the Xperia Z5 Compact (Z5c from here on). In more detail below:DISPLAY:Stunning LCD with virtually no light bleed. Colors are well saturated, and almost approach AMOLED in the level of depth. Whites are accurate, and text overall is sharp. I prefer AMOLED for the true blacks, but this is a very solid LCD. If I had one complaint, it's that the circuitry is sometimes visible in bright light behind the display.DESIGN:The phone fits in the hand very well. The sides are very easy to grip on to, and the frosted finish on the back glass is a huge improvement over the previous Xperia devices. The fingerprint scanner on the power button is extremely accurate and fast. I would have placed the volume button a bit higher than Sony did, however. I haven't tested the waterproofing, but it's a useful feature to have.PERFORMANCE:I was concerned at first about the Snapdragon 810 in the device, and heat issues, but so far, I haven't felt any extreme heating. It does definitely get warm during use, but no more than say, a Samsung Galaxy S6. It's very fast, and for gaming, the 720p display serves it well. Some users have reported performance issues or lagging through the UI, particularly when an SD card is inserted, though I've not noticed any of these. I also have had no issues with streaming Bluetooth audio.BATTERY:I don't think this device will last 2 days on a single charge, though it absolutely can get through a single day's use. I spend roughly half of my day in a low signal area, which I expect would affect this, and thus, lower the battery life. In a stronger signal environment, it would probably last longer.CAMERA:The camera is excellent. The photos are crisp, and sharp on most subjects. Low-light performance could be better, but I have no real complaints with the camera.MISC:It doesn't support Wi-Fi calling, or VoLTE on T-Mobile, though I doubt this can be helped, considering it's an international model.Overall, this is the best option if you're looking for a compact Android device. I'm certainly keeping it."
Good
"Great phone, everything you need in small size. Just like I want.But when I received it, the box wasn't sealed, but still new.Thx"
"I agree with most of the other reviews that state that this is a great reasonably sized phone. Since they already detail the good parts, I'll spare you the extra words.That said, its battery life, size, and camera quality are marred by mediocre Bluetooth performance, camera app unresponsiveness, and poor stability.I've noticed Bluetooth audio with aptX can stutter. While it only happens twice in the included demo video (at 0:44 and 1:10), it can happen rather frequently if there's a lot going on in the background. It's very distracting whenever it happens. I strongly believe that the issue lies with the Z5C's aptX codec:* The headphones in question are the Plantronics BackBeat PRO Wireless Noise Canceling Hi-Fi Headphones with Mic - Compatible with iPhone, iPad, Android, and Other Smart Devices. In my testing, they work fine on the Nexus 4 and OnePlus One (Android phones that *don't* support aptX), and on an iPad and MacBook Pro (Apple devices that *do* support aptX).* Additionally, all of the non-aptX receivers I've tried with this phone work fine. As of this writing, this includes the Amazon Echo, Honda CR-V HandsFreeLink, JayBird BBX1MB BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Black (Discontinued by Manufacturer), and the HomeSpot NFC-Enabled Bluetooth Audio Receiver for Sound System.Despite the inclusion of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 in the phone, it's not very responsive. While taking a video, the camera app appears to stutter and drop a few frames every few seconds. It can be very difficult to stop taking a video - the phone will appear to still be capturing frames, but pressing the stop button can occasionally do nothing. Once the phone is in this state, nothing on the screen will respond including the back, home, and task switcher buttons (even though the camera still updates as you move the phone around). The only way out is to hard reboot (which can take up to three minutes if you have device encryption enabled). If you close the camera using the home button or the task switcher, the rest of the phone becomes very slow until you reopen the camera and close it using the back button.As for stability, I'll just leave the text of my initial 1-star review here:After successfully using this phone for navigation, I put it back in my pocket. When I took it out an hour later, it wouldn't turn back on. I could tell it wasn't a suddenly dead battery because the phone vibrated whenever I put my finger on the fingerprint sensor. I tried a hard reboot by removing and replacing the SIM card and the phone has been unresponsive since then.This is a real shame especially because there are no other decent phones on the market at this form factor (except maybe the Z3 Compact, which I've seen run into the exact same problem).Eventually I figured out that the problem was because Android crashed pretty hard since pressing and holding the ""OFF"" button hidden behind the SIM/SD cover brought the phone back to a working state."
"I got to say after 5 days of use, I absolutely love this phone. The small compact size is perfect for me and I don't mind the thickness, I assume it's thicker than most to put that bigger battery in. I thought it would be hard to go small since I'm coming from the iPhone 6 Plus, but wasn't bad at all in my opinion. This is actually the first android phone that I can say I won't be going back to my iPhone. I get about 1 1/2 days of battery life at moderate use. so far my screen on time averages 4 hours, best was 4 hours 45 minutes. My last android phone was the 2015 moto x pure and that battery life was horrible along with others I have owned, nexus 5x, Htc one m7, m8, m9, nexus 5, and so on which always made me go back to my iPhone along with other reasons. I am in the United States and with At&t and can confirm LTE works perfectly. No issues at all. Also I didn't have to manually put in the APN for mms or Internet to work, u just make sure u have wifi connected and then go to settings, then more, then scroll down and hit internet settings. Hit download and it will automatically download the correct settings for your carrier, make sure your carrier sim is installed. The camera is good enough for me, I'm no professional photographer so I just leave it in superior auto mode and it takes good pics in my opinion. I can confirm the phone back does get a little warm during some situations. First one was downloading all my apps from the play store at the same time. 2nd is using hangouts for video calls, other than that it has been fine. The heat it did get did not burn my hand and was still comfortable to hold and use. I did get the DP glass screen protector which I put on all my phones and I like it. I'm not a case kind of guy so waiting on my dbrand skin. I did get the white version and I have not had any screen issues or my on screen buttons not working on my bed. I assume others just got a defective unit. I got usb cord, earbuds, and a international plug in the box. Just a side not I only have one hand and am super happy that a company actually makes a one handed device with great specs. Most android phones I've had one handed use was very difficult if not impossible but had no choice if wanted top specs, so thank you Sony for high end specs in a compact size."
"One week after used it the phone start acting up, the screen frozen and intermittently lost signal.Not only that, the phone easily to get hot, I see many people has the same issues. I guess the phone it self has hardware problem. I return it back"
No problems yet at all. Met all expectations.
The screen does like crazy things on its own without user touching the screen hate product.
"Well done Sony, the phone is better than expected and I like the compact size, as I find the rest of the models too big for phones and not big enough for tablets ! ;)"
"Very bad GPS, and generally very unreliable... not expected of this ""high end"" expensive product."
"Okay, for those who encounter Bluetooth audio stuttering and choppy sound:after you connect your Bluetooth device, go to Setting -> App -> Running App -> terminate two services: sony screen mirroring and throw...this is a temporary and effective solution that I found with no root access required.I am wondering if Sony software engineers tested their software... Do they only listen music through wired headphone??sigh... their device is so great, but the software is so badly designed.. :(It could be alot better by just using stock android..."
Phone has screen problem making it almost unusable... No warranty and $400+ down the drain. Very very unhappy.
Works as advertised.I wanted a phone that fit in my hands and pocket as a small person.Being able to text with one hand is a plus for me too.
"The phone has been working well so far, but I was disappointed by the thickness which is higher than my previous phone."
Great little phone
"This is awesome deal. Personally I like a compact device. In compact class, this is one of the best smartphone that I ever."
I love my Sony Xperia z5 compact!! It's comparable in size to the iPhone 5c just right for me and having an amazing sound and picture quality is a huge bonus!!!!
Not recommended to water
"This thing gets hot. I have a smart watch and due to some ultra sensitive touch screen it turns on in my pocket a lot. So two day battery life is totally a joke, Im lucky if i get a full day. I really love this phone and the camera is great but the battery is not as great as they say. side note the fingerprint scanner is about 80% accurate."
"Initially everything went well, however, the phone stopped charging in less than 7 months after purchasing from seller. The phone is defective as it should work longer than seven months. I would not recommend seller or phone products given my experience with both seller and/or their products.."
"The staff was dilevered in time, very fast. The quality correspond to price. Thanks for cooperation a lot."
"I bought this phone as a replacement for my Z1 which I had for over two and half years. I had zero issues with it until I shattered the screen. The Xperia line of phones are touted as being waterproof or at least they were initially. Sony seems to have shied away from that position now and for good reason. You see, I originally bought the Z1 for three main reasons: the 20mp camera, water resistance, build quality. My experience with the Z1 lead me to believe that the Z5c would be a suitable replacement. I assumed that the Z5c would certainly exceed the standards set by the Z1. I was wrong.Firstly, the positives1) The camera of the Z5c does outperform the Z1's especially in low light conditions. The overall picture quality is only slightly better, however.2) The UI is smoother and faster, likely due to the more powerful CPU3) Slightly better battery life4) Twice the storage capacity5) No flap cover for the USB slot6) Louder speakersThe negatives1) Plastic frame. The phone feels cheap compared to the Z1. It also is less damage resistant than the metal Z12) Frosted glass back plate. While it looks nice, it makes the phone slick and therefore harder to hold3) Build quality and water resistanceI assumed that the Z5c would be even more watertight than the Z1 since it has a higher IP certification. Nope. Even though I swam with my Z1 dozens of times, occasionally exceeding its depth rating, I never once had any issues. I would even wash it in the sink weekly. The phone was waterproof until I broke the screen. The Z5c, on the other hand, died the very moment it touched water. It was thoroughly waterlogged as if it lacked a water resistant seal entirely.Sony's repair service only made matters worse. They claimed that my Z5c was made for the Polish market (what?) and that there are no repair centers in the US. I was given an address in England to ship it and they said they would pay for Royal Mail shipping. Naturally, they could not seeing as how there are no Royal Mail offices in the US. Despite paying for shipping, Sony fixed the phone free of charge since it was under warranty. The turn around time was a bit over a month. I believe I got lucky as I have read that Sony will not honor warranty claims that are the result of water damage.So I go to turn the phone on and all seems well. At this point, I'm just glad to finally have my phone back. However, to my dismay the volume key does not work. They replaced the screen along with many internal components and performed a diagnostics test and yet somehow the broken volume key passed the test. What the heck. Every Xperia phone lets you run a simple pass/fail diagnostic test in the settings menu. One of the tests is for the volume rocker key. I don't understand how they missed this.I reached out to Sony again who said to ship the phone to them. And so I did. Over three weeks went by before I asked them for a status update. They told me they did not receive my phone. Strange. USPS stated that it passed customs and marked it as delivered. A couple more weeks go by before I receive an international package at my door. I thought maybe they had fixed my phone without notifying me. A foolish thought. What happened was that the Sony Service Center refused to take possession of the package so it was returned to me. Apparently there was a customs fee that they would not pay, despite stating that they would pay for shipping both ways. Since I paid for shipping to them both times they could have at least paid the measly fee. Why would Sony pays for it the first time but not the second? I asked USPS if I could pay the fee upfront and I was told I cannot.I've had it with Sony. Clearly the quality of their phones isn't what it used to be, not to mention the quality of their customer service. I'll update this review if Sony rectifies the situation. Don't hold your breath though."
"Phone is awesome. Finall, now I own a phone with speakers to the front lol Only wished it had come with some headphones. Everything these days are more expensive and coming with less. Atleast I got the charger :-)"
"Bought a Sony Xperia Compact white in January. After a month of use, the screen started giving trouble, now I cannot use it. I replaced the screen, formatted the phone, and nothing works. Also, since it does not come with warranty, I had to cover the costs myself. All in all, I could have gotten a Samsung S7 Edge for all my money. Please do not buy the compact White models, they have been faulty."
Excellent smartphone
The phone is great. Thanks
"Great all-around android device; love the size & shape. Fits well into any pocket, including women's jeans! (This was a problem for me with larger phones.) Fingerprint scanner is a great feature and the camera is great; I haven't tested how waterproof it is yet, but it's nice to not worry about it in rain etc. Software all runs smoothly and I have yet to come up on anything the phone struggles to do.Rated down by 1 star as it tends to heat up and drain battery relatively quickly, though. It's excellent in 60º (F) weather where the air temp naturally compensates, but as it gets up to 80s or 90s the battery just burns up if you're using the screen a lot."
"OK I didn't wanna post any review within a few days of my possession to avoid looking like snap judgment. So I had this phone for about a month now and I gotta say I'm very pleased with it. The display is so beautiful and the clarity is high. Even on low brightness. I thought the screen might be too small for me but it's perfect. I have small hands myself. Now I don't have to stretch my thumb across the screen to text messages. I can text comfortably with one hand. The battery life is just AWESOME!!!! Coming from a MOTO X that could barely last one day, I was afraid the battery life won't be as good for this phone. And I was so wrong. I can easily use this device for two and half days straight without charging it. That includes internet browsing, data using, video and music usage, picture taking and basic calling/texting. Remember still turn off your phone once awhile, it's like a computer, it needs to rest sometime. Anyhow, the only thing that is not too great about this phone is the camera. Don't get me wrong. It takes great and clear pictures. I like the feature that you can choose what to focus when there are multiple things in one frame. The shutter speed sucks. It takes a few seconds for a photo to take a photo. That was pretty disappointing. I did insert a SD card later on and it did help with the speed a little but not too much. But out of all the good things about this phone, I can let one slide. Nothing is perfect right?"
"Purchased on February, now reviewing during August.The Sony Z5 Compact is a great little device with plenty of powerful features.Specs:2GB ramQualcomm Snapdragon 81023 MP Back Camera (wow!)5 MP Front CameraMicro USB Charging Port4.6 inch Touch Screen DisplayIP 68 Waterproof, Dust proof, etc.Micro SD and Nano SIm card slotsReview:Wow!, I'm surprised Sony was able to compact their larger Z5 into such a small body that is convenient for your pocket and your hand. It is truly some remarkable engineering. Well, that compact size does have a drawback that may put some people off which is that it is a blocky/bulky phone. Even though it is a blocky/bulky phone, I always managed to get a nice firm grip because of the size and bulk of the phone. The screen size is perfect in my opinion for the size of this phone which is the same screen size for the iPhone 6/6s. The phone is also waterproof and dustproof which was sort of a minor, yet surprising, thing that Sony would usually put on their phones that is beginning to be used by other phone companies such as Samsung. The Camera packs 23 MP which is quite surprising for the size of the phone. The camera takes good pictures and good videos, HOWEVER, in only good lighting. If you take pictures in the dark, It will appear murky and pixelated. The phone's software experience has been vastly improved from its early beginnings and has lost almost all of its setbacks it had when it started. Sony's android skin is fast and simple, offering a near stock Android Marshmallow experience. The Speakers produce good sound but are located in the most convenient location that most phone companies ignore. The speakers are located in the front with one on top near the camera and one on the bottom. This means you don't cover the speakers when ever you're watching a video in landscape. Most companies put the speakers at the bottom of the phone next to the Micro USB charging port. The biggest grip of the phone is the processor that is encased in it which is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810. This CPU has a well known record of producing more heat than most of other CPUs in the market. This CPU is very powerful and still relevant even with Qualcomm's new CPU the Snapdragon 820, but it just gets hot very quickly. The heat isn't hot to the touch where it is unbearable it just gets warm when gaming, browsing the web, watching videos, etc. The battery life on this phone is great and it usually has enough charge to last me for a whole day and some the day afterwards. This is, However, if you utilize Sony's STAMINA Battery saver feature. You can still get a whole days worth without it, but you will probably have to cut back on CPU intensive tasks. Overall, this phone offers the strength and speed of its older counterpart(Z5) in a neat little package that doesn't make it uncomfortable in the pocket.Pros:Speed and power( CPU).Small and convenient package.Great front and back cameras.Great battery life.Speaker location is very good and sound great.Waterproof.Cons:CPU gets warm very quicklyCamera quality isn't very good in low light conditions.The thickness of the phone may put off some people.Will Update if necessary."
The headphone jack has started malfuctioning within 3 months of use.
Excellent phone! Had the Samsung Galaxy it is over rated. Sony has done an amazing job. Top quality
"Great phone, beautiful design, fast shipment"
"I had high expectations or this phone as a previous z1c and z3c owner. The z1c had the highest build quality in my opinion (the metal casing exuding the appearance of ""high-end""). The z5c is a step down from here, although the performance is updated, the phone does not look or feel high-end in your palm. This isn't a huge deal to me as I primarily use this phone for travel; the small size, waterproofing, and low-key appearance are all assets. However unlike the z1c, I don't enjoy using the z5c at home in the states. One big gripe for me has been the fingerprint scanner. The iPhone will read and unlock my prints 90% of the time, the z5c is probably more like 60% for me. I'm sure experiences will vary.In all its a mediocre phone, but given the choices out there, it is by far the best Android in this size. The vanilla-like Android experience Sony installs is appreciated as well-- its the closest you can get out of the box without buying a Nexus imho."
good
"I bought this for my wife, to replace her (still functional, just aging) Moto G LTE (1st Gen). If you're looking at this product, you're probably aware of the general lack of high-end, small-form-factor Android phones. If you want high-end, you usually have to get something substantially larger than this, and my wife did not want a larger phone. She also wanted something with a much better camera. The z5 compact delivers. She's had it a month now, and she likes it a lot. (I've used it quite a bit as well). The camera is responsive and extremely high quality - it does fairly well in low light as well. The battery life is nothing short of outstanding. Sony's take on Android squashes battery consumption when the phone is idle, even with background apps (facebook messenger, facebook, various google services) all running. I've used a moto x (1st gen), moto x (2nd gen), moto g LTE (1st gen) all recently -- this phone has markedly better battery life than those. It's also stable and fast - the only (very) minor gripe one could have about this phone is Sony's mild modification to the UI, which is not stock. I don't really like the blue menu bars on settings & so on, but once the thing is set up, you shouldn't have to go in to those... so this is mostly a nonissue. Also, the Sony/xperia migration tool made migrating sms messages, pictures, and so on a breeze. This phone is fantastic.Regarding cell coverage and compatibility, we use this phone with Cricket Wireless, which is an AT&T MVNO. The ""bars"" meter apparently is calibrated a bit lower than other phones (ie, displaying 3 bars vs 4, etc), but the actual dB reading is the same as my moto phones on the same carrier in the same location. I'd expect this phone to work absolutely fine with post-paid AT&T service as well, seeing as how it works without issue on their prepaid subsidiary. I cannot vouch for whether or not the carriers can actually activate a new SIM on this phone, however -- I took her old SIM (already activated), cut it, and put it in this phone, which worked fine. I did have to put in the access point (AP) settings, but that's standard practice if you're used to Cricket or other prepaid carriers.re: warranty, I get squaretrade warranties for phones anyway. I'm not sweating the alleged lack of US warranty, though other reports are mixed as to whether Sony would really give you the cold shoulder if you had a legitimate hardware issue with the device.The phone came with an international AC converter to convert it to US 120V to... something else. I live in the United States. I'm not intimately familiar with exactly what kind of converter this is. It comes with a US 120V to USB charger in the box, and then is bundled with this international AC-to-US120V-AC adapter outside. It also has a pair of earbuds in the box."
"too hot, the terrible 810"
"So this isn't actually black. It's a gunmetal grey. I originally settled for black because none of the other colors appealed to me and I am glad that I did now. The color of gunmetal grey looks wonderful and the phone itself is above and beyond all of the ""competition."" The phone is smaller than most smart phones these days but does anything and everything you want it to do. It even has one of the fastest (if not the fastest) processors onboard. My only issue is that it does get a little hot if you're using it for an extended amount of time to do anything too extreme. Wonderful phone though, I made sure to order plenty of tempered glass protectors for the front and back to ensure that I keep this little gem safe. Would highly recommend."
"Phone arrived in 2 days. I am a US customer looking to use the unit with ATT. I received it on Tuesday, and end of day Thursday today, the phone is fully setup customized and functional, but for the carrier. I had some lingering items to wrap up on my old phone, and today I'll be getting ATT service connected. My goal was to keep a smaller phone (~4.5"") like my previous unit to preserve the 1 handed capability, and convenient pocket fit. I don't want a tablet for a phone, and have struggled to find a good modern model match for my needs. The Z5C looked to be a great match, and so far, it's a perfect fit for me.Package appeared to have been opened, however carefully, and then re-sealed. I suspect the reason it was opened was the addition of a US plug adapter for the EU style plug the unit comes with, as it does not look like a Sony converter. Where the phone uses a pretty standard 5V, 1500mA mUSB charger, of which I have a bunch, this wasn't a big deal. All other packages in the box (headphones, USB cable, extra earbud cushions, documents) were all intact and looked brand new, untouched. Phone itself still had original sticky film and packaging, and was in perfect new condition.Phone turned right on, and was ~60% charged. I was prompted quickly to change the language (second or third screen) as I ran setup from German to English I organized the OS as I prefer my phone laid out and set up and connected to wifi. The phone immediately ran two major system updates in parallel, and then after a restart, ran another. I'm now on Android 5.1.1, and admittedly, I'm not sure what it shipped with before the updates as they happened so fast.I love the square edges, which allow for some grip in a smartphone world where everything is slick and like holding onto a watersock if you don't have a cover on it. The phone looks like a sleek, black slab of sexy tech. Seriously, what a cool looking, striking design. The photos don't do it justice. I did buy a low profile cover for drop protection, and have used it intermittently. Compared to the IPhone 6 or the new Galaxy Edge, this is much easier to hold one handed without worrying about it squirting onto the pavement. That said, it's still a pretty slick and smooth piece of hardware in general, and I'd suggest a cover/protection.The phone is a great unit, and a perfect fit for my needs. I love the frosted glass back, the large screen/body ratio, and the charcoal colored polycarb frame.. I know some people take stars away for not liking the case/finish (non metal), but I find that odd. If you don't like it, why'd you drop $500 on it? It's a first class material, so the rest is just opinion. It actually has a pretty metallic look anyways. No one's going to look at this and say ""man, what a cheap looking phone. I promise. Phone does get a bit warm (which I really only experienced during the initial startup/setup), but there's a lot of horsepower in there, and that's to be expected. Nothing that bothered me.The fingerprint tech is awesome, and responds quickly and flawlessly. I have a few different fingers stored so that it's a comfortable unlock both righty and lefty. The hardware is clearly sufficient, as I've had a dozen things going on at once including downloading, a bluetooth beam, installing and updating apps, surfing a few internet tabs and writing a note all at once, and Android ran smooth, slick, quick and didn't break a sweat. Phone a very *solid* feel, very high quality, and certainly a first class phone that can be discussed in the circles of the current high end smartphone competition.Two minor drawbacks that I didn't think were worth removing a star for:1) No wireless charging. If the unit didn't have the rapid charge capability, this may have been a -1, but it charges so damned fast, and keeps charge so long, I couldn't do it. Still would be cool to drop it on those powermats at starbucks. Oh well.2) Volume buttons are too low on the thumb side (righty.) These should have been up top. I'm guessing there was a hardware conflict, but either way, it's a nitpick worth mentioning.Setup with personal and work emails was seamless, and calendar, emails and contacts all downloaded via wifi quickly and easily.I'm headed to ATT to finalize my new account and get the carrier service completed. Unless you see a follow up note from me, assume it also went smoothly."
"Great smartphone, excellent build quality, screen size, and hardware (64bit octacore Snapdragon 810 processor). If you are looking for something comparable in size to the iPhone but want more options and memory and no iOS then this is the perfect device for you and the fingerprint scanner on the power button was a brilliant idea.Due to the 64 bit processor and the 810 processor instructions 2gb of memory has no lag compared to the same system running on a 80x series processor.Great job Sony!Update 12/23/2015I am returning this device constantly runs hot ~143F without video recording, when using google maps or other apps, just beware."
"Pros:One of the better small screen phones still available on the market.Water resistance means you can wash it when it gets dirty, and you won't need to worry about dust getting inside, as long as the flaps are closed properly.Good for one handed usage.Fingerprint scanner works very well.Cons:I got a defective unit with a front camera that partially works. A portion of the picture will turn out yellow due to the broken camera.The design pretty much means this phone is only usable in the right hand. Not very nice for a lefty phone holder."
"I've had a Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, and S4. I understand some people like big phones, however, that's not my preference. That's why when the S5 came out, I started looking for something else. Then I found the Sony's Xperia Z Compact phones. I had originally wanted the Z3+ (Z4 elsewhere), but right when I was about to buy it, the Z5 Compact came out. While it's not available in the US via normal retailers, I was able to get a warranty for it via SquareTrade. So that made it a no brainer for me. I've had it for a few months now and I'm still loving it."
I like the phoneHowever it arrived in a soaking wet box. Completely not even a box anymore. Good thing the phone was waterproof and I know how to read a manual online.
First week and im enjoying this thing! Has nice speakers and perfect camera for a compact phone. This is a complete package.
"It's small, it's functional, an elegant black rectangle"
"First, I want to warn you that I have always loved Sony phones since it was Sony Ericsson. I still remember one of my older phones was a Sony Ericsson K550 that had a 2MP camera but produced pictures with the highest quality. After a disappointment with a Sony Ericsson C901 I decided to switch to Nokia from 2009 until 2013 when I bought a Sony Xperia GO that worked perfectly for 27 months until this November.I decided to buy a Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and after one week I think I can share my experience with all of you.This is a good phone. I know some people would never even consider getting a Sony phone but even they admit Sony is just quality. This phone has an excellent hardware and the way it integrated with the software (Lollipop working perfectly) is what I would call excellence. Connectivity is good since I can connect to 4G (LTE) without any trouble but you need to make sure this phone supports your carrier’s LTE band.Call quality (Let’s remember we still make phone calls with smartphones) is good and I have not had any issues with reception at all. The phone is thick but not as extremely thick as some people have complained. It’s noticeable in your pocket but nothing gross. It’s not heavy or uncomfortable. I have to mention at this point that inserting the SIM card and the memory card is not easy. I swear I’ll never open those slots again. I inserted a 64GB memory card and it’s working flawlessly.The screen delivers beautiful colors and the resolution is excellent. I know some people have complained it could have been better but still is very good. One of the main reasons I love Sony Xperias is because they usually have anti-scratch protection and I witnessed it with my previous Sony Xperia Go as it never got a single scratch in 27 months. The camera has been controversial in some reviews. Look, I know we should believe that smartphones will replace digital cameras but guess what? I don’t think so. The camera takes very good pictures and delivers excellent videos but it’s true it is not perfect. However, the camera is good for most occasions.Sound quality is excellent. I used PowerAMP for my music and this phone has a special feature to improve the overall sound quality with headsets (DSEE HX). It works perfectly and I haven’t had to arrange and tweak the PowerAMP equalizer all over as I did with my previous Sony Xperia GO.Battery life is good but not as other smartphones. If you listen to a lot of music (like me) you’ll need to charge the phone every single day. This is not a problem for me but I know some people might not like it. However, I have to mention that one day I almost didn’t use it and it just discharged from 99% at 7AM to 90% at 7PM so it really depends on usage. Another advantage is that it charges very quickly.The phone is very responsive and I have not experienced any bugs or lags as someone reported before. The camera works pretty well when I click on it taking just one second for the app to open.At this point you must be asking why I’m giving it only 4 stars and I am going to tell you why: heat.Unfortunately, the phone does get warm when you update apps or run another “intensive” process. It’s not all the time so I think Sony has done something maybe not to fix the problem they had before but at least to alleviate it. I want to clarify it gets warm – nothing extreme but still noticeable.This is an excellent phone, really. It’s quality and performance all in one but the heating issue should have been fixed by Sony at this point."
Used to be a z3 compact user.z5 compact is better than z3c.
"Out of the box, the phone was in Chinese and it took a while to get the setting correct. The phone also did not work perfectly after popping in the sim card. I used the phone on AT&T and to activate data on AT&T I had to setup the APN. The instructions are available on AT&T's website.The fingerprint sensor is a good feature; However, I also using an iOS base iPhone 6, and I find too few apps on android fully utilization the feature and I find myself falling back to my iOS device its integration into the apps.Dedicated camera feature is amazing and the new layout of the micro usb is excellent. It feels much more well built than the z3 compact. Speeds are good w/few hiccups."
Took a while but excelent product
good
Awesome piece of kit
"Great phone, I was worried about the phone getting warm, so far no probelm at all (stays cool almost all the time- switching from Iphone).this Compact phone is waterprrof, has an octacore processor...best phone in the market...works great on Tmobile."
"I love the Xperia compacts. They are great size, and fast performance. I don't know why people rave about camera. The quality of the camera is pretty nice, but the software that Sony runs is really slow. Sure, the camera is great, but it takes forever for the camera app to load and and focus on shots. The speed of the phone I love. The weight of the phone is more on the heavier side. I wish it was lighter and also thinner. The phone is a little thick and the volume rocker is in an awkward position. I like the dedicated camera button and I love the features the phone comes with inside its settings. I don't enjoy the placement of the front camera and it also takes some crappy photos as compared with photos taken from the front camera on the iPhone. I wish the apps were faster at loading and taking action."
I was using iPhone for a long time and I'm looking for a small android device that can last me through a day. I'm glad that I stumble upon this Sony Xperia z5 compact. It actually can last me over a full day of usage before I have to charge it. I love the small form factor with all the high end components. I'll stay with this Sony line for a while.
 There is a lot to like about the phone but there are a variety of issues too:1. Most importantly: this phone has a problem with touchscreen sensitivity in the lower part of the screen when the phone is not held in hand. It is particularly bad on some surfaces such as on a bed. Also the problem gets much worse if you install a glass protective screen. It starts being very noticeable on almost all surfaces.I've made a quick demonstration video about the issue (see below). Other users have reported this issue with their phone https://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Xperia-Z5-Z5-Compact-Z5-Premium/z5-compact-touchscreen-acting-weird/m-p/1079627/highlight/false#M6713Therefore it is a design defect by Sony. Surprisingly it appears to affect only the white version of the phone.2. It does heat up quite a lot during normal use (like updating apps) or watching videos. And the battery is drained faster than on previous version that I have (Z1 Compact)3. I didn't see any improvement in photo quality compared to the old Z1 (in fact some pics look worse in identical settings). At the same time there is a substantial improvement in focusing and in video quality.
"I have had this phone for 2 weeks now, and I still have things to evaluate, but so far these are my observations when compared to the features of my prior Galaxy S4 miniFirst pros. this is truly an amazing phone with so many features well beyond my previous Samsung S4 mini. The screen is great, and let's you choose enhancements to it that make pictures and videos really stand out. A 23 MP camera, take very good (albeit large sized) pictures; I have yet to try it in darker situations, where apparently it has been challenged in other reviews. It runs smoothly even when multiple apps are open, and its a breeze to switch between apps. The finger scanner works neatly, although the location will only allow you to use it with your right hand; you can also set up multiple users or guests to the phone, with their own apps, settings and finger scans (kind of like a computer profile), which is great for kids not messing up your settings. It has a ton of customizable phone features for screen, power management sounds, app management, that I was no where close to have with the smaller Galaxy -you can program what the phone will do when you plug it to the charger, when it connects with your car's bluetooh, or when you plug in head phones, so different apps can activate automatically. I do not own a PS3, but apparently you can hook it up somehow to PS3 controllers and play games through it (sounds like a cool feature); it also offers you a lot of connectivity options to external devices like Chromecast. Something I really liked was the corrector/dictionary, actually allows me to type in two different languages and word suggestions come in both without specifying or switching between languages,while keeping your keyboard in the desired setting. Aesthetically the phone looks nice, with a smooth finish front and back; the side material does look on the cheap side though, it would have been nice to have metal on the side instead, but that may hamper the waterproofing capabilities (it says waterproof, but I have n o intention of testing that on a phone w/o warranty). The back is also made of a glassy finish, which does make it a bit slippery in your hands. Finally, the size of the phone (the main thing that drove me to it) is great for its category; Sony really put a lot of features into a small package, making it feel like a flagship rather than a 2nd tier mini version you find of other smaller phones.So for the cons: Its not really the phones fault, but this is a european phone on american network, which means its not fully compatible (at least with Tmobile). It lacks the 3G 1700 band, all other bands apparently are the same as Tmobile network. This has the phone constantly switching between 3G and HSDPA and will drain the battery out in a day or less. I tried the phone for a week in Florida (Ft Lauderdale area) and in Texas (Houston area) and it is about the same, in spite of being large metropolitan areas. I cant tell exactly if HSDPA is equivalent to 4G or 4G LTE connectivity speedwise, so when it is on that it seemed fast-ish. When I mean constant switching I mean sometimes you would actually have to move the phone around so it would get the signal right and download things. This, added to the low battery life, is somewhat annoying which is sad, because the phone does have these apparently great customizable battery saving features that tell you you should have the phone for more than a day without charge, of course it does not count on the phone switching between networks so frequently and battery barely lasts a day with moderate use.Maybe the phone works better on other carriers, it is truly unfortunate that Tmobile/Sony have not agreed to provide this phone on the US market, it is really an awesome phone by itself. If someone knows how to do away with the network issues, or of a carrier where it will work well, let me know"
"Phone is great takes awsome pictures, Bluetooth is a little slow, but i dont use Bluetooth for more than audio. very convenient size"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3bWribaf04I have the problem exactly the same as shown in the video on YTB, and I'd like to know if the problem is only with white z5c?if yes, Can I change for another color?"
"I bought this phone to replace iPhone 4S for my wife. I bought this phone based on my experience with Xperia Z3 for more than a year. I was impressed with the phone battery life, the normal usage definitely gets one full day. I still need to play with the settings to get to two full days of battery. The apps open up fast, the phone is very compact, easy for one-handed use. The finger scanner works very well."
excellent
"**SEE UPDATE BELOW**I've been using this phone for over 3 weeks now and I so glad I went with the Z5C.HARDWAREIt heats up a bit when doing heavy gaming or long video recordings, but not all too concerning...especially considering I don't notice any heat during typical daily operation. I would say the battery is adequate but it wouldn't be considered one of the strengths of this phone. I don't imagine battery life gets any better with other phones unless you go bigger...which, why the hell would you be looking at this phone if you were willing to do that? Go with the Xperia Z5. That said, I haven't experimented too much with ""stamina mode"" but if you use alternate messaging services / apps (like Google Voice) or music streaming apps, you'll have to add those apps as exceptions to be able to use data when the screen is off...which will diminish the benefit of ""stamina mode"" and preclude you from using ""ultra stamina mode"" all together. This is my first Quick Charge 2.0 device and I'm very impressed with how much charge you can get out of having it plugged in a just a while (ie 10 minutes). Wireless charging would've been nice to have but I'll gladly sacrifice that feature to get dual front facing speakers, expandable memory, and water resistance.Speaking of expandable memory. My buddy was playing with a camera-equipped drone his girlfriend got him for Christmas and was bummed he couldn't get the videos off the micro SD card (he didn't have an adapter). Everyone at the party (iPhone users) was blown away at how I was able to get and share the video by putting the micro SD card in my phone and using Google Drive to share it. I don't know why we are letting phone manufacturers sucker us by buying phones without expandable memory.At 720p screen resolution / quality looks great to me. If reading small text is difficult or annoying or you plan on watching HD full-length movies on your phone, get a bigger phone. I have excellent eyesight and find this display great for watching YouTube videos or reading articles.I don't take a lot of photos / videos but I'm pleased with the camera so far. You can find great camera comparisons online. From what I found this camera is great but Samsungs perform better in low-light and close up focusing...but the Z5C is a huge step up from my HTC One M7 when it comes to low light pictures.SOFTWAREI was a big fan of HTC's Sense UI and didn't know how I'd like Sony's UI as this is my first smartphone from them. After downloading an HTC-like free clock / weather widget, I like the UI a lot. Screenshots and screen capture are particularly easy and fun. Still waiting for Android 6.0 Marshmallow update that was promised (see summary below).SUMMARYAs far as I know the perfect phone doesn't exist but based on the other flagship phones available right now and my preference for water-resistance, expandable memory, and front facing speakers...I was prepared to give this phone a perfect 5 stars. I'm giving it 4 however because it would appear that Sony is following the lead of others by promising ""soon"" updates to the latest android version (6.0 Marshmallow) to help sell their new flagship phone but then making those of us who believed them and bought the phone wait around while the update is delayed. If the update comes prior to the new year I'll adjust my review to 5 stars. Almost 3 months for an update seems like enough time to tailor Marshmallow to their UI...if it was a priority.**UPDATE**This is the worst phone I've ever had. On paper it's great but I've never been so frustrated with lagging issue. I'll get a phone call while its in my hand and I'll mis the call because pushing ""answer"" is non-responsive. Killing apps helps a bit but I find myself restarting the phone a lot. I was hoping the Marshmellow update would help but its now March 8th & still no update. First & last time I buy a Sony phone. Since the Galaxy S7 is water resistant with expandable memory, I think I'll get it if a softwarw update comes soon & fixes my problems."
"Pros:+ Good display even with its only HD resolution still delivers vivid and beautiful colors.+ Good hardware specs (Snapdragon 810, 32 GB storage, 2 GB RAM).+ Good design & building Material.+ The place of the finger print sensor is in the same power button and the sensor response is perfect and fast.+ The size is just perfect if you want a small phone so you can handle it by one hand.+ Support SD card, one of the feature that most recent flagship phones now is missing.+ Good connectivity for both phone networks (support LTE, HSPA, GSM) and WiFi signals (support 2.4GHZ & 5 GHz).Cons:- The sound quality isn't one of the best.- The camera isn't that perfect specially with the auto focus.- The home screen little bit sluggish.- It could be much better if it has 3 GB of RAM."
"I've had it two months now and it freezes constantly, heats up really hot every single time I use it, even for a few minutes. It also shuts down apps all the time randomly. The battery is suddenly horrible, it drops 10% everytime I use it so it's dead halfway through the day, then it won't charge, and when you finally get it to charge it will charge all night and still not be at 100. I even deleted everything off my phone to make it run better but it did not change anything. Worst phone I've ever had. Don't waste your money."
It is so beautiful a phone with great camera.
great
"the phone is awesome i like it very much and beside the fact that it fit in y pocket, it`s fast and full of surprises the camera is wonderful it is the phone i was looking for."
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTno doubt innovative design and power but it suffers from two major flaws:1) very very buggy software, Sony mobile did a crappy job implementing the Android platform for this device - camera app crashes all the time, and the it looks like the software is not using the hardware properly and ultimately providing sub optimal performance for a device of this class, especially the camera lag and results quality despite the high specs.2) Heat - when i bought this phone i read many reviews saying that the snapdragon 810 inside is hotter but it only noticeable when capturing a 4K video ( which i wouldn't care less about ) . the truth is that the device is always hot, even on standby, even what doing simple operations like texting and browsing through some pictures. the battery seemed to drain relatively quickly. reading from other reviews it looks like Sony has a serious problem with their QA. what a shame from a technology giant such Sony to ship such a beta product.better go with GX S6 edge which is lighter, more powerful and more assurance about the quality and updates the device will receive along the way."
"I'm still getting used to it but I have to say, it is a very nice device."
"My previous phone was Xperia Z1 and I really loved it so I decided to stick with the brand. I would say that the experience with Z5 is fairly similar - everything is fast and smooth, the camera is nice. This phone apparently came from Hong Kong (or something like this). I had to look at my old phone to figure out how to change the language. In the beginning I was afraid that things won't work properly, but everything has been fine so far (after 2 months of use)"
"Worst cellphone I have ever used. It looked cute and worked fine for the first three weeks. And all kinds of problem shows up. After I upgraded the system, I can't access to my cellular data. I found the instruction online and fixed that manually. I can't use my group message at all.Apparently SONY never realized that normal people will group text each other. My music app starts to play by itself out of blue, which gave me couple of embarrassing moments during meetings.Then the screen cracked. Well, that was my fault. I fixed that by spending 170 dollars more on this stupid phone. And then the front camera is broken. Just to make a double down, my text function starts to fail. My screen turned completely black when I am making a phone call.I don't think SONY is even trying to sell their cellphones. I bought it because it's cute. But I can't even use it as a simple cellphone. NEVER ever ever buy this phone."
Ok
"I love this phone, I was a little worried about the overheating reports but phone run cool even after 20 min of FHD recording on my last beach day."
"It's been a few weeks and having no issues so far. The white color looks great. Good form factor but when the phone gets hot, it becomes uncomfortable to hold so I def recommend a case. The phone is also a bit thick though I suppose it's necessary due to the waterproof material and other hardware necessities to make it up to par with typical devices.The SIM and SD card slots are easily accessible. Fingerprint sensor works great and is super convenient. Battery life lasts a full day but I don't see it going past a full day on normal usage (I'm typically on wifi and 4G). Sony also releases frequent software updates which is amazing compared to manufacturers like Samsung and HTC that take forever to come out with updates. Recently there was a update which allows the camera to launch much faster."
"Awesome phone. This phone is snappy and can handle doing multiple things at one time without slowing down. I have had it for over a month and it hasn't done anything out of the ordinary. Battery life is phenomenal, especially with the stamina mode on. Camera is sweet. This is a phone I can trust. Nothing about it seems fishy. It's fast and reliable and fits in my hand much better than those giants that are passing as normal size phones nowadays. Thank you Sony :)"
"Coming from the Z3C, I can't help but make some comparisons to that phoneThe good:• Shipping was very quick• Phone was flawless in its original packaging• Very quality build and heft to it. Doesn't feel cheap or plasticky at all.• Screen is nice and bright. Call quality is excellent.• Easy to navigate screen interface one handed. Holding it correctly, with your pinkie under the bottom to support the phone, there should be no issue using one handed. Your thumb should be able to reach all spots on the display. As far as I know, this is the only newly released premium handset in this size/form factorThe bad:• Like the Z3C, the back is glass, although frosted this time so the grip is slightly better. Premium feel, but very fragile.• Despite the faster CPU, the interface is slower and not as instant as the Z3C when opening apps.• Battery life is not as good as the Z3C, but still better than any other premium smart phone out there. I was charging every other day with the Z3C, but must charge at the end of the day with the Z5C. This is with moderate use.• The camera is just above average. With Sony optics you would think it would be better than it is.• When taking a photo, the camera is slow to open, and even slower to preview a picture just taken. Can be an issue when trying to catch a moment at just the right time.• For T-mobile, although the hardware supports band 12, T-mobile's 700MHz spectrum, it is not enabled. So you may find spotty reception in areas where you had excellent reception in the past with a T-mobile phone purchased from the carrier. This is more a carrier issue than Sony, since the support is there built into the hardware."
"I love the phone. I was however informed before buying, that the phone would be compatible with the T-Mobile network, but it is not 4G LTE compatible, so I feel like I have been lied to by omission."
"Loved this phone that minute I held it.comfortable nice style, great pics, fast. Works great with t-mobile. The upgrade from z1 was worth it.can't comment yet about battery only have it for 3 days so far no complain but I'll get back on review next month"
"I am satisfy the appearance of the phone, the system is good for me, the weird thing is the phone is Taiwan version not US.The other bad thing is I don't know why I can't open the mobile data, I am not sure it is hardware issue or software bug..."
"I just got the Z5C. Actually it lagged a bit first, but it doesn't right now as it gets warmed-up. I also was thinking the plastic frame would look a bit cheap, but it looks beautiful. I was just surprised that everything was written in Chinese first lol. It's in English now. Anyways, Z5C looks different from Z3C."
"Just got my phone today, haven't gone to t-mobile to activate it but have got it all set up with my google account and so far its AMAZING!!! great service! i had the bonus that my phone came with a head set also.not sure if sony sent it that way or NGP added them but either way. i was super excited. cant wait to try it out once on cell carrier and see how this beauty runs. right now its firing on all systems! thanks for making my day."
"I am a previous owner of the sony xperia z3 compact. This version came with a micro USB cable, power brick, headphones, and some manuals( mostly were not in English). The phone will have android version 5.1.1 (lollipop) straight out of the package with a few pre-installed software that you can delete. After just receiving this phone I noticed that the design was different, and the original fingerprint magnet glass on the rear of the phone from the z3c is replaced by frosted glass. So No more finger prints. Also the phone is slightly more thicker than the z3c and the edges are more round with a matte feel to it. There is only one flap on the left side to insert a memory card or micro SD card on the side. The volume keys are now under the power button which needs getting used to for me. The phone can be charged from the bottom using a micro USB cable which is included. You no longer have to open a flap to charge the phone which doesn't change the fact that the phone is still water proof/resistant. The power button is now longer providing a finger print sensor which works flawlessly so far. I haven't got much time into the user interface but have noticed that the display is very dim compared to the z3c if the adaptive brightness setting is on. So far it feels responsive, no lag, a few tweaks in the UI, and 4G LTE works fine for me. The camera is now 23 MP with fast auto focus, and the front facing camera is 5 MP. Overall great phone, but design could have been better and display is still 720p.UPDATE: Dropped phone on concrete from just above 3ft (with no case), and slightly dented the phone's edge. Screen survived any cracks or damage and phone still works fine."
"Looking for a small sized phone that packs a lot of power? Then this is for you. I may be in a minority but I just don't see the need for phones to be the size that they are right now. I wanted something small enough to operate with one hand and to easily fit in my pocket.My previous phone was an original Moto X and that was a great size for me so I wanted something similar, but all of the OEMs were only producing these massive devices that require two hands to operate. I mean really, how am I supposed to text and drive if I have to take both hands off the wheel? (That's a joke, NEVER text and drive.)So I did tons of research, using the phone comparison feature on sites like gsmarena.com to check the physical dimensions. The other problem was that when I did find a ""small"" phone, it usually had terrible specs. A dumbed down processor from 2 generations ago, not much memory, and often a mediocre camera.Then I found the Sony Xperia Z5 compact. This phone is small but it doesn't skimp on performance. It actually has the same processor as Google's flagship Nexus 6P, so it's blazing fast. Comes with 2GB ram (the 6P has 3GB though I believe) and 32GB built in storage which is easily expanded with an microSD card. Camera is top notch too, being from Sony who has been making cameras and camera lenses for a long time. The other nice thing is the battery life, since it has a good sized battery paired with a smaller screen, the screen actually drains the battery less than on the bigger devices. When I first bought it, I was easily getting 2 days of battery life but now that is more like a day or day and a half depending on my usage.I actually ordered it here unlocked because nobody else is carrying it in the US. When mine arrived, the menus were all in Chinese, but a quick YouTube search showed me how to switch them back to English and I was all set.I'm a big Android fan so I was weary of what kind of bloatware Sony might have installed on this. But it's really not bad at all and feels very similar to a pure android experience. There are a few little things that are different and you can uninstall any of the Sony pre-installed apps without any issue. Mine was also recently OTA'd to Marshmallow which seemed to improve performance quite a bit.Overall, I'm so happy I bought this phone. It's the perfect size if you're looking for a small Android device and has enough processing power to keep up with the latest devices. Oh, the built in fingerprint scanner in the power button is super nice too, as is the physical camera shutter button. Both of these are features I use daily. (Note: I heard that the US spec phones won't have the fingerprint scanner, so be sure to check if that matters to you.)"
good
"I really wanted to like the Xperia Z5 Compact. It had all the things I wanted and it was the right size for my hands. However, it would not communicate with my internet provider. I had contacts with Sony and with Verizon and followed all their advice as to how to fix it. They both ended up blaming the other. So there was no recourse for me but to send it back."
"I love this phone! The size is perfect. It fits in my pocket just fine. The ability to record in 4k is really cool and the quality of the video seems very very nice, even when just played back on the phones display. The display is very sharp and gave me a headache for a day or two but I seem to have adjusted now. Apps load very fast. I am using the At&t nano sim through straight talk and everything is working just fine.The only downside so far is the camera loads fairly slow. My boyfriends iPhone 6 loads the camera and takes six photos by the time this phone loads and takes one. Other than that I am overall pleased with the phone."
I love it
I love it
It was everything I was expecting it to be
"I bought the Sony Xperia Z5 compact and so far it's been a terrific phone. I love this phone so much because it has a long battery life, Android marshmellow, and good camera but let me tell you about the cons.Cons: my number 1 reason why I HATE this phone is the fingerprint lock. My friends saw some private pictures of my girlfriend and I., I was harassed me. it's suppose to be under my fingerprint and my friends can access itSecond: I got in a car rekt after the beach and my phone was dead. It Cannot charge in ANY car. I tried to use multiple chargersThird: I get made fun of cause this phone apparently looks old"
"it was set in Chinese language, was a challenge to turn it to english. But other than that, it works and looks great"
"Good phone, just a little small for me, and the camera is a little slow to wake, things like battery life and general performance are great though, if you need something small and powerful you cant go wrong here."
"Very good, attention fine"
Nice compact phone. Good camera. Screen is 1280x720 but not a biggie cause of the size so its not really noticeable. Battery is not as good as my z1s.
"Excellent phone, arrived in perfect condition and after nearly a month of using, I am quite satisfied with the features of this phone. Was compatible with T Mobile, has a nice fingerprint scanner on the side, though did not come with a headset."
"I'll start by saying this phone is the perfect size, I really wish more phone manufacturers would make phones this size. Also the camera is great and on equal level with a galaxy S7. Unfortunately the phone gets pretty hot under normal use, and the UI is very buggy which makes the phone unenjoyable to use. Hopefully by the end of 2016 we will have more phones that are around this size and not be so limited in our phablet... I mean phone selection."
"It's just a great handset. Good size, takes the best photos ever, runs every app under the sun, really appreciate having the removable memory card."
"Sweet! Like the packaging, fits perfectly... In one word quality. I can't seem to put this phone down, it's perfect.."
Les recomiendo!
So disappointed. Bringing up the camera lags and even worse it takes two seconds to capture the picture. I now understand why Sony decided to discontinue it's Z products. So much potential here though. Sigh
"Great phone, I love it"
"I found that after using the phone's internet browser for just a few minutes, the phone started to get very hot until eventually it was too hot to comfortably handle. This should not happen. Perhaps my phone was defective. Has anyone else ever experienced this problem? I am sending the phone back, but am unfortunately responsible to pay return shipping fees. Hopefully they will not charge me a restocking fee..."
"I use the cellphone for 5 days. Today I charge the battery for a while, when I get it, it was very overheated. I could not even turn it off for many hours when the battery finished. I would like to talk with the seller."
"Great Phone, the UI is the really cool, it feels and look awesome."
"If you want an Android *phone* - not a mini-tablet, something that fits in your hand and doesn't feel like a plate of armor in your front pocket - Sony is now the only game in town (and not in any USA towns...these are imports). I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings.I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the ""lip"" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases.I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone.Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled.Just buy it. I hope Sony sells enough to make Z5 Compact successors."
"This is the best phone I have ever had. The main features I was looking for in a new phone were small size and battery life and I don' think it gets any better than the Z5 compact. My previous phone was a Droid Mini because it was the smallest Android phone available on Verizon. I was hesitant to switch from Verizon because I had been with them for a decade, but I have had no problems so far on AT&T and the Z5 Compact performs great and feels great (much better than the plasticky Droid Mini). In terms of battery life I would take the Mini off of the charger at 7am and with light-average usage it would be dead by 4pm. The same routine with the Z5 Compact always shows more than 65% battery remaining at 4pm."
"It takes around 5 seconds to open the camera, which is very disappointing. The phone heats up very easily while doing intensive tasks. Size is comfortable to hold but the screen is a little worse than expected because it's 720p only. I returned this phone, but the most disappointing is that it's been three days since the return package arrived at seller but I still don't have my refund back yet."
"I've had a z3compact and my only complain is that I kinda like the design of the z3c better than this matte finish and kinda bulky z5c.other than that, fingerprint scanner is really responsive.. works about 80% of the time. battery life feels a bit shorter than my z3c but still manages to go for atleast a day and a half."
"When I first held this phone, I had the sudden urge to hum the James Bond theme.The Z5 Compact exudes class. There is no other way to put it. It's hands-down the most premium feeling phone I've held - and that's with it swinging against the big guns such as the S6 Edge, HTC One, and iPhone 6.Cons:-I'm not a huge fan of the frosted back, and think it would have looked better with a normal glass back or just a continuation of the excellent plastic used for the sides. This is largely personal preference though.-The volume rocker is in an extremely awkward position. Unlike the Z3 Compact, you really have to work to use it. Would have been better located above the power button.-It comes in Japanese, and it's very difficult to find the language setting. Pull down the notification bar, then again for settings, click the gear, scroll down to the keyboard, then the top setting.Pros:-The fingerprint sensor/power button is fantastic. It's placed perfectly, works fast, and has just the right feel.-Impeccable fit and finish.-Near stock android.-Design.-Specs.-Camera button, which is sadly a dying feature. The quick-launch ability alone makes it worth having."
"There really isn't anything like it available for purchase at this time. This phone is exactly what the iPhone users are hanging onto, a sub 5 inch phone with competitive specs. The 720p resolution is totally fine for the size of the screen. If you feel like it is a big sacrifice, just remember it improves the battery life (up to 2 days). The camera is pretty amazing and the expandable memory (micro sd) is also a breath of fresh air coming from an iPhone. If you want the freedom of Android and a reasonably priced phone (unlike the iPhone), then do not hesitate, BUY IT!"
"This phone is exactly what I've been looking for. I have small hands and would like it if it were even smaller, but I can't complain since it's pretty small compared to all the phones available now. I have att and it works great. The screen looks great, it's snappy, and I even like that it's not so thin. Really thin phones are hard to hold and even cramp my hands sometimes. Battery life is about average. Fingerprint sensor works great. Although battery isn't removable, SD and Sim cards are. I really wish Sony success because I'd hate to see this line of phones go away."
"I've had my device for one and personally it's just what I was looking for! Prior to the Z5C I owned the Z3 (5.2 in screen) and I love that phone but I wanted something a bit smaller in hand. At first I was kind of iffy going from a 1080 to a 720 display resolution but honestly you can barely tell a difference. You would really have to pay close attention to the screen to point out the difference. I am glad I wen with the Z5C, it is a premium phone in a compact size. I've yet to try the camera but I did video recorder for a few minutes and the 4K recording is amazing. How can such a compact device record so well and crisp! Thank you Sony!"
I love this phone!
"Love this phone the camera is amazing the features is awesome, plus I get to play my ps4 on my phone"
"The best phone of the moment!!!! This little device is amazing!!! And no, its not a mini tablet, is a smartphone so the size is just perfect!"
"great phone and great style. It gets a tad warm when apps like snapchat are open for a long time. Other than that it's perfect, quick, and stylish."
Very good phone
"Love this phone. Just as good as the Z3 compact. Great battery life, perfect size, and love the waterproofness. No problems with overheating."
"I ordered this phone for my wife who was using an iPhone 4. The phone arrived in a few days (faster than expected). The box was sealed, so I was confident it was new as advertised. Out of the box it had 52% battery. I started the setup process and connected it to my home wifi network. The phone then told me it needed to perform a software upgrade. I said yes, and this process took about 15 minutes. I then took the phone to a nearby AT&T store to have them install a nano-SIM card. In 10 minutes this process was completed without any issues. It connected to the AT&T network in my home state of NY. So far, I'm very happy with this phone."
Overall good!
"I think it was mildly used, there were Chinese apps installed on it, a Chinese user logged on and the plastic on it was slightly pulled off.But it was in a good condition and nothing is wrong with it so far."
"The weight and size of this phone are ideal in my opinion. It is also very very fast, water resistant, very good battery life, looks very good, unreal 4k video(tested and impressed... pausing the video looks like a photo even on a large monitor), has a clear sharp display, great audio and a fantastic (for a phone) camera. I loved my Sony ZL phone, got it wet so then went to the Z1 which is great but too big and heavy for me. This is the best phone out there for my needs right now and I believe this size of phone will make a huge comeback as it is truly ideal, great job Sony! (PS I am on T-Mobile and I don't think I am getting LTE but still quite fast and battery drain is not an issue)"
"This phone is a hard-to-find size unless you decide to join the dark side and buy Apple. I was looking for a multi function (smart) phone not a tablet that also has a phone. For me, bigger is not better. The phone is fast, has enough storage for most people and also that storage can be expanded by up to 100Gb via SD card. After reading the write-ups, I decided that this was the right one. I then had to decide which model, US or International and which vendor. I chose the international model, E5823 because it was a tad lower price but more importantly has the fingerprint reader (left off of the E5803, US model). There were two other criteria - would Sony honor the warranty in the US? Answer from Sony, yes. It may take a couple more days to process, but no warranty issue. Their service center is in Laredo Texas. Also, I wanted to know where I might have to return the phone if it arrived DOA (it didn't). Some vendors require shipping back to Europe or Hong Kong at a cost of $50-$60. No way on that. I chose to buy from CANGURO through Amazon. They are in Chicago and back the product from there. They answered all of my questions. EXCELLENT seller! There is one issue with the phone and it's a software issue. It was not enough for me to downgrade the rating, but might be an issue for you. After upgrading to Android 6.0, Marshmallow, the FM radio freezes after 15-20 minutes. It sometimes requires re-booting the phone to exit the app. Sony has promised a fix."
Great phone... Arriving at time.
"I bought this phone to replace my Z3 Compact.It's an improved version, so it excels the previous one, but has a major bug. The phone randomly shuts down once or twice every day! Just from nothing, freezes and restarts. Quite annoying, it takes ~2 minutes... I ve tried what the support team said i should do, but didn't fix the issue. As i bought it without warranty im sticking with a brand new useless phone. Also, this happened to A LOT of people."
"great smartphone, excelent service"
"Not very serious with the time delivery, the device it's ok to use in Mex. with Telcel and US with T-mobile"
awesome
"Great phone, feels a bit thicker than my Z1 though."
"Overall, this has been a great device. The camera is very laggy, but it seems to be a software issue that Sony is aware of. Hopefully they fix it. Otherwise, solid phone!"
"Long story short: this is the phone that finally convinced me to make the jump from Apple's iOS. I had been considering making the jump for some time, but I had yet to find an Android phone that matched the build quality and performance of my iPhone 6S. The z5 Compact finally did convinced me.Pros:+ Same size screen as the iPhone 6S, despite being smaller and lighter.+ Excellent build quality - the phone feels premium, solid and well made. I don't worry about anything breaking if I drop it once or twice.+ Waterproof!+ Very little manufacturer bloatware, especially compared to Samsung or LG. Among other things, this means that future Android updates will hit this phone sooner than many other Android devices.+ I actually most of the bloatware that's included. Sony's launcher is fast and responsive - I'm actually using it instead of the official Google launcher.+ Camera is high quality.+ Better battery life than my iPhone 6s+ Fingerprint scanner+ Plenty of processing power - I haven't yet seen the phone slow down or choke on any app I've thrown at it.Cons:- Cases options for this phone in the U.S. are limited when compared to the dancing plethora of iPhone cases that flood every electronics store, website, gas station and grocery store.- Because this is the international version of the phone, there's no warranty- Because this is the international version of the phone, some apps think I'm in Ireland. I'm sure a simple setting could easily change this, but I haven't yet found it.- Fingerprint scanner doesn't work as well as iPhone 6S (though it's still good). I think this is mainly due to the fact that the scanner is smaller than the iPhone scanner, so it has less to work with.Overall, I've found this phone to be the perfect fit for me. It really hits the sweet spot of combining the power, battery life, screen size and non-bloated OS that I've been looking for."
"The phone is good, stable, small. But when my phone cracked, Sony was really competing with five-ply-a$$wipe on the scale of efficient and successful support. Seriously. If you ever expect that you'll need to call Sony to fix something that might have gone wrong, just get a different device and don't look back."
"EDIT (1/9/16): My original evaluation of this phone remains the same but I would encourage people to look at the HTC One A9 as it addresses the US compatability aspect while still being pocketable. It is not as compact as the Z5c, meaning Sony is still the only name in the game but the A9 is still manageable. You can read my review here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B017D554UKI have been through every phone you can imagine and the Sony Xperia Compact line continues to impress me. I recently had a Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x and the sizes are just to much for me. Yes, I really want Marshmallow but can wait an extra few weeks for it. I asked a few questions before buying and had trouble getting clear information due to the technical nature, but wanted to clarify for those who are looking.This phone is almost fully compatible with T-Mobile USA and I can confirm Band 12 (Extended Range LTE) *does* work (confirmed with LTE Discovery). However, there is no HD Voice, VoLTE or WiFi Calling. For me, these trade-offs were well worth it because of the phenomenal battery life (which will likely get better on Marshmallow), the compact form factor and water resistance (just nice to have as a backup). If WiFi calling is an issue for you, you can use something like Hangouts phone calls as a backup. It is of course not as convenient, but it works. HD Voice is only compatible T-Mobile <> T-Mobile and, yes, you can tell the difference and I wish I had it - but again, not a huge trade-off. VoLTE is the one that gets me. For those of you that don't know, this means the phone drops your data down to 3G/HSPA when making a phone call. Not the end of the world but you may notice the difference when navigating, tethering to your PC, trying to navigate, etc. Again, you could get around this by using a third-party dialer (Hangouts) since that is a VoIP call but for most people, this may be overkill. I suspect though most people buying this phone are pretty familiar with these things since the phone is not advertised in the US. The lack of VoLTE/WiFi Calling/HD Voice is the only reason I knocked off a star.Note the phone comes with an international charger and adapter. It is compatible with QuickCharge technology and charges rapidly for example with this Swiftrans 3221263 Quick Charge 2.0 36W Dual Ports USB Car ChargerThe camera on the phone is pretty good - not the best - but will be fine for 9/10 people.I am using the phone with Aomax® For Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini Tempered Glass Screen Protector [Superslim 0.26mm,2.5D Round Edge,9H Hardness] [Retail Package] For(Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini) and Orzly® - FlexiSlim Case for SONY XPERIA Z5 COMPACT (2015 SmartPhone Model / Smallest Version / XPERIA Z5 MINI) - Super Slim (0.35mm) Protective Phone Cover in Semi Transparent WHITE. It was important to me I protected the device but didn't go overboard on the bulkiness - the combination of these two are perfect. I have reviewed each of these independently but included one picture here of the phone, glass and case together.Overall this is an awesome phone for people who aren't concerned about buying direct from a carrier and don't want a huge phone."
"This device heats up way too quickly and can get really hot. The fingerprint sensor is decent, although nothing compared to the accuracy and responsiveness of the nexus 5x sensor. I would've kept this phone if not for the thermal issues which is quite a defect in this phone."
"The phone looks great, I love the phone but no 4G or LTE on T-Mobile network. False advertising by the seller ( Mobile Front ) when they say "" Work GSM Network only Will NOT work with Sprint, Nextel, Verizon etc"" what is the point of buying LTE phone if it does not work!! . Note you will only get H+ on T-Mobile"
"An amazing phone! If you are in the US be prepared to run into small workable issues. I use AT&T and the company was great in supporting the unlocked phone, setting me up with a visit to the distribution office for the Nano-sim install and activation. The issues I am talking about is the distribution centers have no experience with this phone and had no idea how to move the data from my old Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) to the new phone, how to install the Nano Sim or the SD card. Since AT&T will not allow two phones to be active at the same time I could not download the Xperia App to the old phone --- you must do this prior to deactivating the old sim --- via Google play, a similar app is needed for Bluetooth transfer --- the only option to find and buy the Xperia data cable and try that. For those reading this and are thinking that all I have to do is to remove the SD card from the old Samsung Rugby which is also an Android device with all the latest updates. It doesn’t work, the Xperia Z5 compact rejected the phone contacts as not being in the right format. What the heck? The Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) does not use the *.vcf format and will not transfer to the Xperia.Even if I have to transfer all my contacts to my new Xperia Z5 Compact manually I’m willing to do so. This phone supports amazingly clear conversations using Bluetooth headset, speaker-phone, or near the face, the camera is outstanding. Even though there are complaints of the 780 display I don’t see it. I am very happy with a phone that is not tethered to a charging dock every few hours. I have to ask, if wireless means you are not connected to an RJ jack but are tethered to a charger all the time what is the difference? Bonus, with the reasonable screen size I do not have to hire a porter and baggage cart to haul it around, it fits into my pocket, imagine that!"
"I've always been an iPhone guy but Android phones have always intrigued me. I've had a lot of Android phones but none have really excited me all that much so I went back to Apple. I'm very happy with the Z 5 Compact and have finally found something to keep me away from my iPhone. This phone is built really well, looks sharp and is the perfect size.The phone is speedy, all wireless connections are sturdy and I love Sony's Android Skin."
"TL;DR PRO/CON list at bottom.I will start off this review by saying that I really wanted to love this phone. It does have some very good qualities about it. But the phone has its faults, which are enough for me to not give this phone a recommendation. I have used the phone for approximately 6 months.By background is that I worked in the cell phone industry selling phones for years, before moving into corporate IT and networking. I have been a amateur phone enthusiast and have easily had over 30 phones in my day. I also take exceptional care of my belongings, electronics getting special care. Seeing as this phone is a bit expensive for the size, it was a bit of a treat for myself as the specs and design looked like everything I wanted.HardwareScreen is a nice size for one handed use. Is very crisp and easy to see inside and outside in bright sunlight. Physical buttons are a tad awkward being so low on the device, but worked well for how I hold a phone. They provide enough click, but are a little hard to ""feel out"" and press during a call. Volume on the dual speakers is adequate for a small phone and produce decent sound. Sound through earphones is very good. 2 GB of RAM is more than enough to power the 720p screen and the 810 processor never lets up. The fingerprint scanner is top notch. Works very fast and recognizes fingers well. It allows 5 fingers to be registered. I did my wife's thumb, left index, right index, and my right thumb twice for better accuracy on my main digit. Sometimes I would pull the phone out of my pocket and it would already have registered my thumb and unlocked itself.UI, Performance, and Battery LifeThis phone came with Android Lollipop and is now updated to Marshmallow. The UI runs well. The fast processor and 2 GB of RAM don't let this phone slow down much if at all. Sony's take on Android is a very clean and minimal. Although there is plenty of Sony ""bloatware"" apps that come preinstalled and cannot be removed. You can ""disable"" them so they are no longer active and don't appear in the menu, but still live on the device. The Snapdragon 810 does still tend to get hot at random times. An app may be running in the background and you can feel the phone get much warmer. Never hot that you feel in danger, but warm enough to warranty a reboot in my opinion. Once back up the device was cool again. Battery life on the phone is decent, but not close to the expectation that Sony has set with previous devices in the series. It will get you through a day easily with moderate to heavy use, and can easily stretch to two days with light use. Recharge time however is very long. If you plug into a PC to charge expect at least 3 - 4 hours to charge it up. A quick charge adapter is a wise investment if you get this phone.Apps and GamingI largely got this phone for remote play on the PS4; that feature worked wonderfully with no issues. While the small screen was a little hard to see at times, I never had an issue with pairing the PS4 controller via bluetooth or playing over WiFi. The stock messaging app always gave me trouble with MMS messages, even with the correct settings from AT&T. I constantly got a you have an MMS to download message even though I already read the message. Textra fixed that issue and is a much better messaging app in my opinion. I don't really play any other types of mobile games, but companion apps for Destiny, Metal Gear Solid V, and standard apps like The Weather Channel all ran great on the device. As mentioned before there is A LOT of Sony branded items that are just flat out annoying and not needed.CameraWonderful camera. Loved to take pictures with this phone. They almost always come out clear and sharp. With the latest updates the camera opens quickly. The phone does a good job of fast auto-focus as promised. The shutter key on the side of the device is great for open the camera quickly and nice to take a picture. Finger placement while holding the phone is a bit awkward as the camera is very close the the top edge of the phone and gets covered easy if you are not careful. I spent most of my time in superior auto mode which produces 8 mp images. Going into manual will give you an overwhelming amount of options and allow full 23 mp pictures.DesignLooking at the phone it screams premium. Add waterproofing to the device and that is just piece of mind that some rain or accidental spills will not harm the device. No flap for the charge port is also wonderful as I've seen my share of them get damaged on phone such as the Galaxy S5 which kills the waterproofing of the device. The phone has a heafty weight to it that also feels good. The frosted glass back looks very nice and does not attract fingerprints. The phone is very slippery. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being course grit sand paper and 10 being metal coated in Teflon covered in olive oil, this phone is a 9 easy. The phone literally wants to slide out of your hand whenever you hold it. If nothing else a case is needed to provide some grip to the phone. Having a glass front and back also made me extra cautious and nervous about potential cracks. But I have always taken care of my devices and never cracked a screen.Phone callsPhone calls on the device were clean on my end every time. There were issues for the other caller especially when I used speaker phone. Callers would often complain that they heard themselves or that they could not hear me until I went back to the earpiece. It also appeared that using the speaker phone only used the bottom speaker and not both.DurabilityThis phone is by its very nature fragile. With over 90% of the outer casing being glass, you better believe this baby is delicate. The phone came with a pre-installed screen protector, but it became cruddy very fast. I normally don't use a screen protector and have never had an issue. I somehow managed to put a small scratch on the screen while it was in my pocket with NOTHING else in it one day while hiking. It was no big deal, as I couldn't see it when the screen was on, but I knew it was there and worried me that it got damaged so easily. Now just recently a friend placed my phone near a counter edge, and a got a few messages in a row that made the device vibrate right off the edge. Of course it landed face down on kitchen tile. Screen completely shattered and the touch screen stopped functioning altogether. I am not knocking this phone because of my stupid mistake, not many phones if any would survive a fall like that. Instead it just goes to show that a rugged case is just about required for this device. Which is a huge bummer since the phone looks so good.TL;DR and PROS/CONS ListPROS-- Nice screen for a smaller phone-- Beautiful design-- Great camera-- Fast performance-- Sony's UI has a good design-- Waterproof-- Native PS4 remote playCons-- Sony bloatware that cannot be removed, just disabled-- Slippery-- Fragile-- Poor speaker phone quality for the other caller-- Awkward button placement-- Very slow charge time-- Expensive-- Sony is slow to update UIConclusion and thoughtsThe phone is not worth the price. The camera is very nice and waterproofing is a big plus, but a few nice features do not outweigh the fact you are terrified to accidentally drop such an expensive phone. If you don't let anyone else touch this phone, and put it in a really hard-core case, it may last you a good while. If you live in the real world where you may leave you phone on a desk, give it to someone to take a picture of you, or bump into something with the phone in your pocket it may be dropped and will break."
Great phone. I replaced a Google nexus 5 with this. Wife already had the z3 compact. Easy decision.
DESIGN: greatPERFORMANCE: great.CAMERA: greatDISPLAY: mediocreFINGERPRINT SCANNER: unreliable
"great phone! fast, smoth, convenient size..."
"The phone is ok , the size and weight are nice BUTwhen you use it for more the few minutes feel SOOOO HOT that fact make me give 3 starsI think that hot is good for health and is a failure a big one"
"I love this phone. Personally, I like my mobile phones to be mobile. I don't want to look like I'm talking to a graphing calculator. It's fast, has a great camera, and fits in all my pockets."
"Looking for a small sized phone that packs a lot of power? Then this is for you. I may be in a minority but I just don't see the need for phones to be the size that they are right now. I wanted something small enough to operate with one hand and to easily fit in my pocket.My previous phone was an original Moto X and that was a great size for me so I wanted something similar, but all of the OEMs were only producing these massive devices that require two hands to operate. I mean really, how am I supposed to text and drive if I have to take both hands off the wheel? (That's a joke, NEVER text and drive.)So I did tons of research, using the phone comparison feature on sites like gsmarena.com to check the physical dimensions. The other problem was that when I did find a ""small"" phone, it usually had terrible specs. A dumbed down processor from 2 generations ago, not much memory, and often a mediocre camera.Then I found the Sony Xperia Z5 compact. This phone is small but it doesn't skimp on performance. It actually has the same processor as Google's flagship Nexus 6P, so it's blazing fast. Comes with 2GB ram (the 6P has 3GB though I believe) and 32GB built in storage which is easily expanded with an microSD card. Camera is top notch too, being from Sony who has been making cameras and camera lenses for a long time. The other nice thing is the battery life, since it has a good sized battery paired with a smaller screen, the screen actually drains the battery less than on the bigger devices. When I first bought it, I was easily getting 2 days of battery life but now that is more like a day or day and a half depending on my usage.I actually ordered it here unlocked because nobody else is carrying it in the US. When mine arrived, the menus were all in Chinese, but a quick YouTube search showed me how to switch them back to English and I was all set.I'm a big Android fan so I was weary of what kind of bloatware Sony might have installed on this. But it's really not bad at all and feels very similar to a pure android experience. There are a few little things that are different and you can uninstall any of the Sony pre-installed apps without any issue. Mine was also recently OTA'd to Marshmallow which seemed to improve performance quite a bit.Overall, I'm so happy I bought this phone. It's the perfect size if you're looking for a small Android device and has enough processing power to keep up with the latest devices. Oh, the built in fingerprint scanner in the power button is super nice too, as is the physical camera shutter button. Both of these are features I use daily. (Note: I heard that the US spec phones won't have the fingerprint scanner, so be sure to check if that matters to you.)"
good
"I really wanted to like the Xperia Z5 Compact. It had all the things I wanted and it was the right size for my hands. However, it would not communicate with my internet provider. I had contacts with Sony and with Verizon and followed all their advice as to how to fix it. They both ended up blaming the other. So there was no recourse for me but to send it back."
"I love this phone! The size is perfect. It fits in my pocket just fine. The ability to record in 4k is really cool and the quality of the video seems very very nice, even when just played back on the phones display. The display is very sharp and gave me a headache for a day or two but I seem to have adjusted now. Apps load very fast. I am using the At&t nano sim through straight talk and everything is working just fine.The only downside so far is the camera loads fairly slow. My boyfriends iPhone 6 loads the camera and takes six photos by the time this phone loads and takes one. Other than that I am overall pleased with the phone."
I love it
I love it
It was everything I was expecting it to be
"I bought the Sony Xperia Z5 compact and so far it's been a terrific phone. I love this phone so much because it has a long battery life, Android marshmellow, and good camera but let me tell you about the cons.Cons: my number 1 reason why I HATE this phone is the fingerprint lock. My friends saw some private pictures of my girlfriend and I., I was harassed me. it's suppose to be under my fingerprint and my friends can access itSecond: I got in a car rekt after the beach and my phone was dead. It Cannot charge in ANY car. I tried to use multiple chargersThird: I get made fun of cause this phone apparently looks old"
"it was set in Chinese language, was a challenge to turn it to english. But other than that, it works and looks great"
Excellent phone! Had the Samsung Galaxy it is over rated. Sony has done an amazing job. Top quality
"This phone is exactly what I was looking for. More compact so I can actually hold and utilize it with one hand, still water proof for random spills and drops in the pool, and great photos!I had a little trouble at first because I forgot all of the little things one must do to get a network unbranded phone to work. Also, if you don't remove the plastic screen protector that comes on it in the box, it will disrupt your ear proximity sensor.Some things you'll have to check if you want full functionality of your phone will be your SMS service center number, APN access point network for Internet and Lte to work, network settings in general. All of this info is available online, so don't be deterred. It's very easy to just type in a couple of numbers and enjoy your new phone."
"If you're looking for a compact phone, this is the one to get. Compact size without sacrificing CPU and other features like most other ""mini"" phones. I am using this on AT&T in the USA.Pros:- Battery life is astounding. I usually go to bed with ~40% battery after a day of use.- Compact size - so awesome. Hate how big most phones are these days, this is the perfect size for me- Fast. ""Flagship"" phone specs but in a compact size.- Fingerprint scanner. Love this. I hate lock screens but I am required to use them for a few apps, and company policy. Fingerprint scanner works pretty well.- Smart lock - nice feature that is new to me. Auto-unlocks the phone based on certain conditions, such as if certain bluetooth devices are connected, by location (while at home for example) and/or other criteria. Makes having a lock screen much less of a pain.- Dedicated camera button, press and hold to power on the phone and open camera, nice for quick photos- Dual front-facing speakers. Very loud, sound is decent, a bit tinny, but that's expected from such a small device.- Great screen, very clear and bright, no complaints there- Did I mention it's tiny?Cons:- Camera is pretty mediocre. I'm not a big camera user but for some this may be a dealbreaker. My 4 year old HTC One M7 took far better pictures.- Now that I've had it several months, the fingerprint scanner is getting a little glitchy. Most of the time a reboot fixes the problem, but usually comes back after a couple days. Definitely annoying.- Case options are pretty limited, and many of them cover the power button therefore disabling the use of the fingerprint scanner.- 720p resolution. Honestly I don't consider this a downside at all, who wants to watch 1080p video on a 4"" screen anyway. But for some, resolution is important.- Personally I don't like the factory dialer. I almost always dial by number and this one pulls up a list of contacts by default and takes an extra tap to get the keypad. Slightly annoying, but easily fixed with 3rd-party dialers in the Play store.- Gorilla Glass. Hotly debated, but this phone doesn't have it. Sony uses their own proprietary tempered glass, supposedly just as scratch-resistant as Gorilla Glass. I've own the phone for 3 months now and have zero scratches, and survived a couple drops."
"Nice compact pocket sized phone. A very decent photo camera.Compared to my old Z1 compact, it's much better in every sense and at normal affordable price.The fingerprint opening works mostly ok and is quite useful"
"Stay away from this phone.I purchased this phone less than a year ago. From the beginning the phone was a little slow to respond in many ways but I could deal with it. About 3 months ago the camera stopped working entirely. I called customer support and was told to do a soft reset, then hard reset. Neither of those worked.I asked about sending the phone in for repair and was informed that because this model came from Hong Kong, that they could not repair it, it is not covered under warranty, I would have to contact the Hong Kong customer service. I have been back and forth between both Hong Kong and US customer service, both of them just give me the run around and refuse to take responsibility for their faulty product, and will not repair it. After contacting the US customer service again, they advised me to do a software repair. I followed the steps and now my phone is entirely stuck on the beginning intro screen and will not function at all. In other words, right now I paid over $500.00 for a non functioning phone with Sony refusing to fix their faulty product.This phone is a giant lemon, and after dealing with Sonys customer service I will never purchase a Sony product again."
"If you want an Android *phone* - not a mini-tablet, something that fits in your hand and doesn't feel like a plate of armor in your front pocket - Sony is now the only game in town (and not in any USA towns...these are imports). I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings.I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the ""lip"" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases.I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone.Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled.Just buy it. I hope Sony sells enough to make Z5 Compact successors."
"Love it. Had the z3 compact for one year and made the upgrade mainly for the fingerprint sensor that, although it's not as good as the one on the iphone 6s, works alright. Also, the camera is a bit better (though the one on the z3 compact was already something amazing) and... what else? overall it looks better, nicer, more premium feel to it ;) I miss magnetic charging though..."
"I have bought phone of white color. Excellent design, ideal size, powerful hardware! Only one drawback - at start of some power applications phone is heated. 9,5 points from 10."
"Nice Smartphone, excellent service. Great experience."
"I love this phone! The size is perfect. It fits in my pocket just fine.

"I've had a Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, and S4. I understand some people like big phones, however, that's not my preference. That's why when the S5 came out, I started looking for something else. Then I found the Sony's Xperia Z Compact phones. I had originally wanted the Z3+ (Z4 elsewhere), but right when I was about to buy it, the Z5 Compact came out. While it's not available in the US via normal retailers, I was able to get a warranty for it via SquareTrade. So that made it a no brainer for me. I've had it for a few months now and I'm still loving it."

False advertising by the seller ( Mobile Front ) when they say "" Work GSM Network only Will NOT work with Sprint, Nextel, Verizon etc"" what is the point of buying LTE phone if it does not work!! . Note you will only get H+ on T-Mobile"
"An amazing phone! If you are in the US be prepared to run into small workable issues. I use AT&T and the company was great in supporting the unlocked phone, setting me up with a visit to the distribution office for the Nano-sim install and activation. The issues I am talking about is the distribution centers have no experience with this phone and had no idea how to move the data from my old Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) to the new phone, how to install the Nano Sim or the SD card. Since AT&T will not allow two phones to be active at the same time I could not download the Xperia App to the old phone --- you must do this prior to deactivating the old sim --- via Google play, a similar app is needed for Bluetooth transfer --- the only option to find and buy the Xperia data cable and try that. For those reading this and are thinking that all I have to do is to remove the SD card from the old Samsung Rugby which is also an Android device with all the latest updates. It doesn’t work, the Xperia Z5 compact rejected the phone contacts as not being in the right format. What the heck? The Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) does not use the *.vcf format and will not transfer to the Xperia.Even if I have to transfer all my contacts to my new Xperia Z5 Compact manually I’m willing to do so. This phone supports amazingly clear conversations using Bluetooth headset, speaker-phone, or near the face, the camera is outstanding. Even though there are complaints of the 780 display I don’t see it. I am very happy with a phone that is not tethered to a charging dock every few hours. I have to ask, if wireless means you are not connected to an RJ jack but are tethered to a charger all the time what is the difference? Bonus, with the reasonable screen size I do not have to hire a porter and baggage cart to haul it around, it fits into my pocket, imagine that!"
"I've always been an iPhone guy but Android phones have always intrigued me. I've had a lot of Android phones but none have really excited me all that much so I went back to Apple. I'm very happy with the Z 5 Compact and have finally found something to keep me away from my iPhone. This phone is built really well, looks sharp and is the perfect size.The phone is speedy, all wireless connections are sturdy and I love Sony's Android Skin."
"TL;DR PRO/CON list at bottom.I will start off this review by saying that I really wanted to love this phone. It does have some very good qualities about it. But the phone has its faults, which are enough for me to not give this phone a recommendation. I have used the phone for approximately 6 months.By background is that I worked in the cell phone industry selling phones for years, before moving into corporate IT and networking. I have been a amateur phone enthusiast and have easily had over 30 phones in my day. I also take exceptional care of my belongings, electronics getting special care. Seeing as this phone is a bit expensive for the size, it was a bit of a treat for myself as the specs and design looked like everything I wanted.HardwareScreen is a nice size for one handed use. Is very crisp and easy to see inside and outside in bright sunlight. Physical buttons are a tad awkward being so low on the device, but worked well for how I hold a phone. They provide enough click, but are a little hard to ""feel out"" and press during a call. Volume on the dual speakers is adequate for a small phone and produce decent sound. Sound through earphones is very good. 2 GB of RAM is more than enough to power the 720p screen and the 810 processor never lets up. The fingerprint scanner is top notch. Works very fast and recognizes fingers well. It allows 5 fingers to be registered. I did my wife's thumb, left index, right index, and my right thumb twice for better accuracy on my main digit. Sometimes I would pull the phone out of my pocket and it would already have registered my thumb and unlocked itself.UI, Performance, and Battery LifeThis phone came with Android Lollipop and is now updated to Marshmallow. The UI runs well. The fast processor and 2 GB of RAM don't let this phone slow down much if at all. Sony's take on Android is a very clean and minimal. Although there is plenty of Sony ""bloatware"" apps that come preinstalled and cannot be removed. You can ""disable"" them so they are no longer active and don't appear in the menu, but still live on the device. The Snapdragon 810 does still tend to get hot at random times. An app may be running in the background and you can feel the phone get much warmer. Never hot that you feel in danger, but warm enough to warranty a reboot in my opinion. Once back up the device was cool again. Battery life on the phone is decent, but not close to the expectation that Sony has set with previous devices in the series. It will get you through a day easily with moderate to heavy use, and can easily stretch to two days with light use. Recharge time however is very long. If you plug into a PC to charge expect at least 3 - 4 hours to charge it up. A quick charge adapter is a wise investment if you get this phone.Apps and GamingI largely got this phone for remote play on the PS4; that feature worked wonderfully with no issues. While the small screen was a little hard to see at times, I never had an issue with pairing the PS4 controller via bluetooth or playing over WiFi. The stock messaging app always gave me trouble with MMS messages, even with the correct settings from AT&T. I constantly got a you have an MMS to download message even though I already read the message. Textra fixed that issue and is a much better messaging app in my opinion. I don't really play any other types of mobile games, but companion apps for Destiny, Metal Gear Solid V, and standard apps like The Weather Channel all ran great on the device. As mentioned before there is A LOT of Sony branded items that are just flat out annoying and not needed.CameraWonderful camera. Loved to take pictures with this phone. They almost always come out clear and sharp. With the latest updates the camera opens quickly. The phone does a good job of fast auto-focus as promised. The shutter key on the side of the device is great for open the camera quickly and nice to take a picture. Finger placement while holding the phone is a bit awkward as the camera is very close the the top edge of the phone and gets covered easy if you are not careful. I spent most of my time in superior auto mode which produces 8 mp images. Going into manual will give you an overwhelming amount of options and allow full 23 mp pictures.DesignLooking at the phone it screams premium. Add waterproofing to the device and that is just piece of mind that some rain or accidental spills will not harm the device. No flap for the charge port is also wonderful as I've seen my share of them get damaged on phone such as the Galaxy S5 which kills the waterproofing of the device. The phone has a heafty weight to it that also feels good. The frosted glass back looks very nice and does not attract fingerprints. The phone is very slippery. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being course grit sand paper and 10 being metal coated in Teflon covered in olive oil, this phone is a 9 easy. The phone literally wants to slide out of your hand whenever you hold it. If nothing else a case is needed to provide some grip to the phone. Having a glass front and back also made me extra cautious and nervous about potential cracks. But I have always taken care of my devices and never cracked a screen.Phone callsPhone calls on the device were clean on my end every time. There were issues for the other caller especially when I used speaker phone. Callers would often complain that they heard themselves or that they could not hear me until I went back to the earpiece. It also appeared that using the speaker phone only used the bottom speaker and not both.DurabilityThis phone is by its very nature fragile. With over 90% of the outer casing being glass, you better believe this baby is delicate. The phone came with a pre-installed screen protector, but it became cruddy very fast. I normally don't use a screen protector and have never had an issue. I somehow managed to put a small scratch on the screen while it was in my pocket with NOTHING else in it one day while hiking. It was no big deal, as I couldn't see it when the screen was on, but I knew it was there and worried me that it got damaged so easily. Now just recently a friend placed my phone near a counter edge, and a got a few messages in a row that made the device vibrate right off the edge. Of course it landed face down on kitchen tile. Screen completely shattered and the touch screen stopped functioning altogether. I am not knocking this phone because of my stupid mistake, not many phones if any would survive a fall like that. Instead it just goes to show that a rugged case is just about required for this device. Which is a huge bummer since the phone looks so good.TL;DR and PROS/CONS ListPROS-- Nice screen for a smaller phone-- Beautiful design-- Great camera-- Fast performance-- Sony's UI has a good design-- Waterproof-- Native PS4 remote playCons-- Sony bloatware that cannot be removed, just disabled-- Slippery-- Fragile-- Poor speaker phone quality for the other caller-- Awkward button placement-- Very slow charge time-- Expensive-- Sony is slow to update UIConclusion and thoughtsThe phone is not worth the price. The camera is very nice and waterproofing is a big plus, but a few nice features do not outweigh the fact you are terrified to accidentally drop such an expensive phone. If you don't let anyone else touch this phone, and put it in a really hard-core case, it may last you a good while. If you live in the real world where you may leave you phone on a desk, give it to someone to take a picture of you, or bump into something with the phone in your pocket it may be dropped and will break."
Great phone. I replaced a Google nexus 5 with this. Wife already had the z3 compact. Easy decision.
DESIGN: greatPERFORMANCE: great.CAMERA: greatDISPLAY: mediocreFINGERPRINT SCANNER: unreliable
"great phone! fast, smoth, convenient size..."
"Good phone, just a little small for me, and the camera is a little slow to wake, things like battery life and general performance are great though, if you need something small and powerful you cant go wrong here."
"I've had it two months now and it freezes constantly, heats up really hot every single time I use it, even for a few minutes. It also shuts down apps all the time randomly. The battery is suddenly horrible, it drops 10% everytime I use it so it's dead halfway through the day, then it won't charge, and when you finally get it to charge it will charge all night and still not be at 100. I even deleted everything off my phone to make it run better but it did not change anything. Worst phone I've ever had. Don't waste your money."
It is so beautiful a phone with great camera.
great
"the phone is awesome i like it very much and beside the fact that it fit in y pocket, it`s fast and full of surprises the camera is wonderful it is the phone i was looking for."
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTno doubt innovative design and power but it suffers from two major flaws:1) very very buggy software, Sony mobile did a crappy job implementing the Android platform for this device - camera app crashes all the time, and the it looks like the software is not using the hardware properly and ultimately providing sub optimal performance for a device of this class, especially the camera lag and results quality despite the high specs.2) Heat - when i bought this phone i read many reviews saying that the snapdragon 810 inside is hotter but it only noticeable when capturing a 4K video ( which i wouldn't care less about ) . the truth is that the device is always hot, even on standby, even what doing simple operations like texting and browsing through some pictures. the battery seemed to drain relatively quickly. reading from other reviews it looks like Sony has a serious problem with their QA. what a shame from a technology giant such Sony to ship such a beta product.better go with GX S6 edge which is lighter, more powerful and more assurance about the quality and updates the device will receive along the way."
"I'm still getting used to it but I have to say, it is a very nice device."
"My previous phone was Xperia Z1 and I really loved it so I decided to stick with the brand. I would say that the experience with Z5 is fairly similar - everything is fast and smooth, the camera is nice. This phone apparently came from Hong Kong (or something like this). I had to look at my old phone to figure out how to change the language. In the beginning I was afraid that things won't work properly, but everything has been fine so far (after 2 months of use)"
"Worst cellphone I have ever used. It looked cute and worked fine for the first three weeks. And all kinds of problem shows up. After I upgraded the system, I can't access to my cellular data. I found the instruction online and fixed that manually. I can't use my group message at all.Apparently SONY never realized that normal people will group text each other. My music app starts to play by itself out of blue, which gave me couple of embarrassing moments during meetings.Then the screen cracked. Well, that was my fault. I fixed that by spending 170 dollars more on this stupid phone. And then the front camera is broken. Just to make a double down, my text function starts to fail. My screen turned completely black when I am making a phone call.I don't think SONY is even trying to sell their cellphones. I bought it because it's cute. But I can't even use it as a simple cellphone. NEVER ever ever buy this phone."
Ok
"The weight and size of this phone are ideal in my opinion. It is also very very fast, water resistant, very good battery life, looks very good, unreal 4k video(tested and impressed... pausing the video looks like a photo even on a large monitor), has a clear sharp display, great audio and a fantastic (for a phone) camera. I loved my Sony ZL phone, got it wet so then went to the Z1 which is great but too big and heavy for me. This is the best phone out there for my needs right now and I believe this size of phone will make a huge comeback as it is truly ideal, great job Sony! (PS I am on T-Mobile and I don't think I am getting LTE but still quite fast and battery drain is not an issue)"
"Everything good with this buddy, although it crashes sometimes with snapchat and sometimes you wish the battery last longer (cause it should since it is 2600mAh) but its all what it says to be, so, we are good."
"This started out as an amazing device. Unfortunately, it did not end well. I am not going to list how amazing the phone is or the pros, the hardware specs already do. The problems with this phone are that it started to slow down over time because it began overheating. It becomes unresponsive and then apps crash. A separate issue is when it randomly reboots. This is unrelated to overheating. I honestly really like the device, but what's practical about an overheating supercar? Nothing. I remove 3 stars for overheating, software issues, and because they were severe enough that I had to return the device."
soooooooo ggggggoooooooooddddddd phone
"Excellent phone , the only one with a small screen (fits smaller hands) and a killer hardware/software combination. The camera is really good and the screen is super sharp. Truly excellent engineering work. My wife had iPhone 5s and a huawei p8 and this is beating them on the first round"
I am a fellow Sony Xperia z3 compact moving up to the z5 compact. Definitely a better phone. The LCD screen is definitely an improvement. The speakers are definitely louder. Fingerprint sensor works perfect. The 32 gigabytes of internal memory is also a plus due to all the apps that are out there that you may want or need. Camera definitely takes better pictures but I would not say it's a faster speed to take the picture
"A very well-designed and compact phone. I migrated to this from an HTC M8 one and I love that I can put the phone in my pocket now and not feel like it's awkward to sit or bend at the hip. It also feels speedier and is easy to hold: no slick, curved, and stylish-yet-impractical backplate here."
awesome!!!!
Very good
"Firstly, I don't often review products, and even less often am I this satisfied with a smartphone. As a consumer, I'm incredibly attentive to the small details in a product, and if the issue is annoying enough, I'll return it. Not so with the Xperia Z5 Compact (Z5c from here on). In more detail below:DISPLAY:Stunning LCD with virtually no light bleed. Colors are well saturated, and almost approach AMOLED in the level of depth. Whites are accurate, and text overall is sharp. I prefer AMOLED for the true blacks, but this is a very solid LCD. If I had one complaint, it's that the circuitry is sometimes visible in bright light behind the display.DESIGN:The phone fits in the hand very well. The sides are very easy to grip on to, and the frosted finish on the back glass is a huge improvement over the previous Xperia devices. The fingerprint scanner on the power button is extremely accurate and fast. I would have placed the volume button a bit higher than Sony did, however. I haven't tested the waterproofing, but it's a useful feature to have.PERFORMANCE:I was concerned at first about the Snapdragon 810 in the device, and heat issues, but so far, I haven't felt any extreme heating. It does definitely get warm during use, but no more than say, a Samsung Galaxy S6. It's very fast, and for gaming, the 720p display serves it well. Some users have reported performance issues or lagging through the UI, particularly when an SD card is inserted, though I've not noticed any of these. I also have had no issues with streaming Bluetooth audio.BATTERY:I don't think this device will last 2 days on a single charge, though it absolutely can get through a single day's use. I spend roughly half of my day in a low signal area, which I expect would affect this, and thus, lower the battery life. In a stronger signal environment, it would probably last longer.CAMERA:The camera is excellent. The photos are crisp, and sharp on most subjects. Low-light performance could be better, but I have no real complaints with the camera.MISC:It doesn't support Wi-Fi calling, or VoLTE on T-Mobile, though I doubt this can be helped, considering it's an international model.Overall, this is the best option if you're looking for a compact Android device. I'm certainly keeping it."
"I've had my device for one and personally it's just what I was looking for! Prior to the Z5C I owned the Z3 (5.2 in screen) and I love that phone but I wanted something a bit smaller in hand. At first I was kind of iffy going from a 1080 to a 720 display resolution but honestly you can barely tell a difference. You would really have to pay close attention to the screen to point out the difference. I am glad I wen with the Z5C, it is a premium phone in a compact size. I've yet to try the camera but I did video recorder for a few minutes and the 4K recording is amazing. How can such a compact device record so well and crisp! Thank you Sony!"
"It's been a few weeks and having no issues so far. The white color looks great. Good form factor but when the phone gets hot, it becomes uncomfortable to hold so I def recommend a case. The phone is also a bit thick though I suppose it's necessary due to the waterproof material and other hardware necessities to make it up to par with typical devices.The SIM and SD card slots are easily accessible. Fingerprint sensor works great and is super convenient. Battery life lasts a full day but I don't see it going past a full day on normal usage (I'm typically on wifi and 4G). Sony also releases frequent software updates which is amazing compared to manufacturers like Samsung and HTC that take forever to come out with updates. Recently there was a update which allows the camera to launch much faster."
"Awesome phone. This phone is snappy and can handle doing multiple things at one time without slowing down. I have had it for over a month and it hasn't done anything out of the ordinary. Battery life is phenomenal, especially with the stamina mode on. Camera is sweet. This is a phone I can trust. Nothing about it seems fishy. It's fast and reliable and fits in my hand much better than those giants that are passing as normal size phones nowadays. Thank you Sony :)"
"Coming from the Z3C, I can't help but make some comparisons to that phoneThe good:• Shipping was very quick• Phone was flawless in its original packaging• Very quality build and heft to it. Doesn't feel cheap or plasticky at all.• Screen is nice and bright. Call quality is excellent.• Easy to navigate screen interface one handed. Holding it correctly, with your pinkie under the bottom to support the phone, there should be no issue using one handed. Your thumb should be able to reach all spots on the display. As far as I know, this is the only newly released premium handset in this size/form factorThe bad:• Like the Z3C, the back is glass, although frosted this time so the grip is slightly better. Premium feel, but very fragile.• Despite the faster CPU, the interface is slower and not as instant as the Z3C when opening apps.• Battery life is not as good as the Z3C, but still better than any other premium smart phone out there. I was charging every other day with the Z3C, but must charge at the end of the day with the Z5C. This is with moderate use.• The camera is just above average. With Sony optics you would think it would be better than it is.• When taking a photo, the camera is slow to open, and even slower to preview a picture just taken. Can be an issue when trying to catch a moment at just the right time.• For T-mobile, although the hardware supports band 12, T-mobile's 700MHz spectrum, it is not enabled. So you may find spotty reception in areas where you had excellent reception in the past with a T-mobile phone purchased from the carrier. This is more a carrier issue than Sony, since the support is there built into the hardware."
"I love the phone. I was however informed before buying, that the phone would be compatible with the T-Mobile network, but it is not 4G LTE compatible, so I feel like I have been lied to by omission."
"Loved this phone that minute I held it.comfortable nice style, great pics, fast. Works great with t-mobile. The upgrade from z1 was worth it.can't comment yet about battery only have it for 3 days so far no complain but I'll get back on review next month"
"I am satisfy the appearance of the phone, the system is good for me, the weird thing is the phone is Taiwan version not US.The other bad thing is I don't know why I can't open the mobile data, I am not sure it is hardware issue or software bug..."
"I just got the Z5C. Actually it lagged a bit first, but it doesn't right now as it gets warmed-up. I also was thinking the plastic frame would look a bit cheap, but it looks beautiful. I was just surprised that everything was written in Chinese first lol. It's in English now. Anyways, Z5C looks different from Z3C."
"Just got my phone today, haven't gone to t-mobile to activate it but have got it all set up with my google account and so far its AMAZING!!! great service! i had the bonus that my phone came with a head set also.not sure if sony sent it that way or NGP added them but either way. i was super excited. cant wait to try it out once on cell carrier and see how this beauty runs. right now its firing on all systems! thanks for making my day."
"I am a previous owner of the sony xperia z3 compact. This version came with a micro USB cable, power brick, headphones, and some manuals( mostly were not in English). The phone will have android version 5.1.1 (lollipop) straight out of the package with a few pre-installed software that you can delete. After just receiving this phone I noticed that the design was different, and the original fingerprint magnet glass on the rear of the phone from the z3c is replaced by frosted glass. So No more finger prints. Also the phone is slightly more thicker than the z3c and the edges are more round with a matte feel to it. There is only one flap on the left side to insert a memory card or micro SD card on the side. The volume keys are now under the power button which needs getting used to for me. The phone can be charged from the bottom using a micro USB cable which is included. You no longer have to open a flap to charge the phone which doesn't change the fact that the phone is still water proof/resistant. The power button is now longer providing a finger print sensor which works flawlessly so far. I haven't got much time into the user interface but have noticed that the display is very dim compared to the z3c if the adaptive brightness setting is on. So far it feels responsive, no lag, a few tweaks in the UI, and 4G LTE works fine for me. The camera is now 23 MP with fast auto focus, and the front facing camera is 5 MP. Overall great phone, but design could have been better and display is still 720p.UPDATE: Dropped phone on concrete from just above 3ft (with no case), and slightly dented the phone's edge. Screen survived any cracks or damage and phone still works fine."
"I love this phone, I was a little worried about the overheating reports but phone run cool even after 20 min of FHD recording on my last beach day."
"This phone is a hard-to-find size unless you decide to join the dark side and buy Apple. I was looking for a multi function (smart) phone not a tablet that also has a phone. For me, bigger is not better. The phone is fast, has enough storage for most people and also that storage can be expanded by up to 100Gb via SD card. After reading the write-ups, I decided that this was the right one. I then had to decide which model, US or International and which vendor. I chose the international model, E5823 because it was a tad lower price but more importantly has the fingerprint reader (left off of the E5803, US model). There were two other criteria - would Sony honor the warranty in the US? Answer from Sony, yes. It may take a couple more days to process, but no warranty issue. Their service center is in Laredo Texas. Also, I wanted to know where I might have to return the phone if it arrived DOA (it didn't). Some vendors require shipping back to Europe or Hong Kong at a cost of $50-$60. No way on that. I chose to buy from CANGURO through Amazon. They are in Chicago and back the product from there. They answered all of my questions. EXCELLENT seller! There is one issue with the phone and it's a software issue. It was not enough for me to downgrade the rating, but might be an issue for you. After upgrading to Android 6.0, Marshmallow, the FM radio freezes after 15-20 minutes. It sometimes requires re-booting the phone to exit the app. Sony has promised a fix."
Great phone... Arriving at time.
"I bought this phone to replace my Z3 Compact.It's an improved version, so it excels the previous one, but has a major bug. The phone randomly shuts down once or twice every day! Just from nothing, freezes and restarts. Quite annoying, it takes ~2 minutes... I ve tried what the support team said i should do, but didn't fix the issue. As i bought it without warranty im sticking with a brand new useless phone. Also, this happened to A LOT of people."
"great smartphone, excelent service"
"Not very serious with the time delivery, the device it's ok to use in Mex. with Telcel and US with T-mobile"
awesome
"Great phone, feels a bit thicker than my Z1 though."
"Overall, this has been a great device. The camera is very laggy, but it seems to be a software issue that Sony is aware of. Hopefully they fix it. Otherwise, solid phone!"
"Long story short: this is the phone that finally convinced me to make the jump from Apple's iOS. I had been considering making the jump for some time, but I had yet to find an Android phone that matched the build quality and performance of my iPhone 6S. The z5 Compact finally did convinced me.Pros:+ Same size screen as the iPhone 6S, despite being smaller and lighter.+ Excellent build quality - the phone feels premium, solid and well made. I don't worry about anything breaking if I drop it once or twice.+ Waterproof!+ Very little manufacturer bloatware, especially compared to Samsung or LG. Among other things, this means that future Android updates will hit this phone sooner than many other Android devices.+ I actually most of the bloatware that's included. Sony's launcher is fast and responsive - I'm actually using it instead of the official Google launcher.+ Camera is high quality.+ Better battery life than my iPhone 6s+ Fingerprint scanner+ Plenty of processing power - I haven't yet seen the phone slow down or choke on any app I've thrown at it.Cons:- Cases options for this phone in the U.S. are limited when compared to the dancing plethora of iPhone cases that flood every electronics store, website, gas station and grocery store.- Because this is the international version of the phone, there's no warranty- Because this is the international version of the phone, some apps think I'm in Ireland. I'm sure a simple setting could easily change this, but I haven't yet found it.- Fingerprint scanner doesn't work as well as iPhone 6S (though it's still good). I think this is mainly due to the fact that the scanner is smaller than the iPhone scanner, so it has less to work with.Overall, I've found this phone to be the perfect fit for me. It really hits the sweet spot of combining the power, battery life, screen size and non-bloated OS that I've been looking for."
"The phone is good, stable, small. But when my phone cracked, Sony was really competing with five-ply-a$$wipe on the scale of efficient and successful support. Seriously. If you ever expect that you'll need to call Sony to fix something that might have gone wrong, just get a different device and don't look back."
"Very good, attention fine"
Nice compact phone. Good camera. Screen is 1280x720 but not a biggie cause of the size so its not really noticeable. Battery is not as good as my z1s.
"Excellent phone, arrived in perfect condition and after nearly a month of using, I am quite satisfied with the features of this phone. Was compatible with T Mobile, has a nice fingerprint scanner on the side, though did not come with a headset."
"I'll start by saying this phone is the perfect size, I really wish more phone manufacturers would make phones this size. Also the camera is great and on equal level with a galaxy S7. Unfortunately the phone gets pretty hot under normal use, and the UI is very buggy which makes the phone unenjoyable to use. Hopefully by the end of 2016 we will have more phones that are around this size and not be so limited in our phablet... I mean phone selection."
"It's just a great handset. Good size, takes the best photos ever, runs every app under the sun, really appreciate having the removable memory card."
"Sweet! Like the packaging, fits perfectly... In one word quality. I can't seem to put this phone down, it's perfect.."
Les recomiendo!
So disappointed. Bringing up the camera lags and even worse it takes two seconds to capture the picture. I now understand why Sony decided to discontinue it's Z products. So much potential here though. Sigh
"Great phone, I love it"
"I use the cellphone for 5 days. Today I charge the battery for a while, when I get it, it was very overheated. I could not even turn it off for many hours when the battery finished. I would like to talk with the seller."
"Great Phone, the UI is the really cool, it feels and look awesome."
"If you want an Android *phone* - not a mini-tablet, something that fits in your hand and doesn't feel like a plate of armor in your front pocket - Sony is now the only game in town (and not in any USA towns...these are imports). I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings.I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the ""lip"" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases.I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone.Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled.Just buy it. I hope Sony sells enough to make Z5 Compact successors."
"This is the best phone I have ever had. The main features I was looking for in a new phone were small size and battery life and I don' think it gets any better than the Z5 compact. My previous phone was a Droid Mini because it was the smallest Android phone available on Verizon. I was hesitant to switch from Verizon because I had been with them for a decade, but I have had no problems so far on AT&T and the Z5 Compact performs great and feels great (much better than the plasticky Droid Mini). In terms of battery life I would take the Mini off of the charger at 7am and with light-average usage it would be dead by 4pm. The same routine with the Z5 Compact always shows more than 65% battery remaining at 4pm."
"It takes around 5 seconds to open the camera, which is very disappointing. The phone heats up very easily while doing intensive tasks. Size is comfortable to hold but the screen is a little worse than expected because it's 720p only. I returned this phone, but the most disappointing is that it's been three days since the return package arrived at seller but I still don't have my refund back yet."
"I've had a z3compact and my only complain is that I kinda like the design of the z3c better than this matte finish and kinda bulky z5c.other than that, fingerprint scanner is really responsive.. works about 80% of the time. battery life feels a bit shorter than my z3c but still manages to go for atleast a day and a half."
"When I first held this phone, I had the sudden urge to hum the James Bond theme.The Z5 Compact exudes class. There is no other way to put it. It's hands-down the most premium feeling phone I've held - and that's with it swinging against the big guns such as the S6 Edge, HTC One, and iPhone 6.Cons:-I'm not a huge fan of the frosted back, and think it would have looked better with a normal glass back or just a continuation of the excellent plastic used for the sides. This is largely personal preference though.-The volume rocker is in an extremely awkward position. Unlike the Z3 Compact, you really have to work to use it. Would have been better located above the power button.-It comes in Japanese, and it's very difficult to find the language setting. Pull down the notification bar, then again for settings, click the gear, scroll down to the keyboard, then the top setting.Pros:-The fingerprint sensor/power button is fantastic. It's placed perfectly, works fast, and has just the right feel.-Impeccable fit and finish.-Near stock android.-Design.-Specs.-Camera button, which is sadly a dying feature. The quick-launch ability alone makes it worth having."
"There really isn't anything like it available for purchase at this time. This phone is exactly what the iPhone users are hanging onto, a sub 5 inch phone with competitive specs. The 720p resolution is totally fine for the size of the screen. If you feel like it is a big sacrifice, just remember it improves the battery life (up to 2 days). The camera is pretty amazing and the expandable memory (micro sd) is also a breath of fresh air coming from an iPhone. If you want the freedom of Android and a reasonably priced phone (unlike the iPhone), then do not hesitate, BUY IT!"
"This phone is exactly what I've been looking for. I have small hands and would like it if it were even smaller, but I can't complain since it's pretty small compared to all the phones available now. I have att and it works great. The screen looks great, it's snappy, and I even like that it's not so thin. Really thin phones are hard to hold and even cramp my hands sometimes. Battery life is about average. Fingerprint sensor works great. Although battery isn't removable, SD and Sim cards are. I really wish Sony success because I'd hate to see this line of phones go away."
"I've had my device for one and personally it's just what I was looking for! Prior to the Z5C I owned the Z3 (5.2 in screen) and I love that phone but I wanted something a bit smaller in hand. At first I was kind of iffy going from a 1080 to a 720 display resolution but honestly you can barely tell a difference. You would really have to pay close attention to the screen to point out the difference. I am glad I wen with the Z5C, it is a premium phone in a compact size. I've yet to try the camera but I did video recorder for a few minutes and the 4K recording is amazing. How can such a compact device record so well and crisp! Thank you Sony!"
"I love the Xperia compacts. They are great size, and fast performance. I don't know why people rave about camera. The quality of the camera is pretty nice, but the software that Sony runs is really slow. Sure, the camera is great, but it takes forever for the camera app to load and and focus on shots. The speed of the phone I love. The weight of the phone is more on the heavier side. I wish it was lighter and also thinner. The phone is a little thick and the volume rocker is in an awkward position. I like the dedicated camera button and I love the features the phone comes with inside its settings. I don't enjoy the placement of the front camera and it also takes some crappy photos as compared with photos taken from the front camera on the iPhone. I wish the apps were faster at loading and taking action."
I was using iPhone for a long time and I'm looking for a small android device that can last me through a day. I'm glad that I stumble upon this Sony Xperia z5 compact. It actually can last me over a full day of usage before I have to charge it. I love the small form factor with all the high end components. I'll stay with this Sony line for a while.
 There is a lot to like about the phone but there are a variety of issues too:1. Most importantly: this phone has a problem with touchscreen sensitivity in the lower part of the screen when the phone is not held in hand. It is particularly bad on some surfaces such as on a bed. Also the problem gets much worse if you install a glass protective screen. It starts being very noticeable on almost all surfaces.I've made a quick demonstration video about the issue (see below). Other users have reported this issue with their phone https://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Xperia-Z5-Z5-Compact-Z5-Premium/z5-compact-touchscreen-acting-weird/m-p/1079627/highlight/false#M6713Therefore it is a design defect by Sony. Surprisingly it appears to affect only the white version of the phone.2. It does heat up quite a lot during normal use (like updating apps) or watching videos. And the battery is drained faster than on previous version that I have (Z1 Compact)3. I didn't see any improvement in photo quality compared to the old Z1 (in fact some pics look worse in identical settings). At the same time there is a substantial improvement in focusing and in video quality.
"I have had this phone for 2 weeks now, and I still have things to evaluate, but so far these are my observations when compared to the features of my prior Galaxy S4 miniFirst pros. this is truly an amazing phone with so many features well beyond my previous Samsung S4 mini. The screen is great, and let's you choose enhancements to it that make pictures and videos really stand out. A 23 MP camera, take very good (albeit large sized) pictures; I have yet to try it in darker situations, where apparently it has been challenged in other reviews. It runs smoothly even when multiple apps are open, and its a breeze to switch between apps. The finger scanner works neatly, although the location will only allow you to use it with your right hand; you can also set up multiple users or guests to the phone, with their own apps, settings and finger scans (kind of like a computer profile), which is great for kids not messing up your settings. It has a ton of customizable phone features for screen, power management sounds, app management, that I was no where close to have with the smaller Galaxy -you can program what the phone will do when you plug it to the charger, when it connects with your car's bluetooh, or when you plug in head phones, so different apps can activate automatically. I do not own a PS3, but apparently you can hook it up somehow to PS3 controllers and play games through it (sounds like a cool feature); it also offers you a lot of connectivity options to external devices like Chromecast. Something I really liked was the corrector/dictionary, actually allows me to type in two different languages and word suggestions come in both without specifying or switching between languages,while keeping your keyboard in the desired setting. Aesthetically the phone looks nice, with a smooth finish front and back; the side material does look on the cheap side though, it would have been nice to have metal on the side instead, but that may hamper the waterproofing capabilities (it says waterproof, but I have n o intention of testing that on a phone w/o warranty). The back is also made of a glassy finish, which does make it a bit slippery in your hands. Finally, the size of the phone (the main thing that drove me to it) is great for its category; Sony really put a lot of features into a small package, making it feel like a flagship rather than a 2nd tier mini version you find of other smaller phones.So for the cons: Its not really the phones fault, but this is a european phone on american network, which means its not fully compatible (at least with Tmobile). It lacks the 3G 1700 band, all other bands apparently are the same as Tmobile network. This has the phone constantly switching between 3G and HSDPA and will drain the battery out in a day or less. I tried the phone for a week in Florida (Ft Lauderdale area) and in Texas (Houston area) and it is about the same, in spite of being large metropolitan areas. I cant tell exactly if HSDPA is equivalent to 4G or 4G LTE connectivity speedwise, so when it is on that it seemed fast-ish. When I mean constant switching I mean sometimes you would actually have to move the phone around so it would get the signal right and download things. This, added to the low battery life, is somewhat annoying which is sad, because the phone does have these apparently great customizable battery saving features that tell you you should have the phone for more than a day without charge, of course it does not count on the phone switching between networks so frequently and battery barely lasts a day with moderate use.Maybe the phone works better on other carriers, it is truly unfortunate that Tmobile/Sony have not agreed to provide this phone on the US market, it is really an awesome phone by itself. If someone knows how to do away with the network issues, or of a carrier where it will work well, let me know"
"Phone is great takes awsome pictures, Bluetooth is a little slow, but i dont use Bluetooth for more than audio. very convenient size"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3bWribaf04I have the problem exactly the same as shown in the video on YTB, and I'd like to know if the problem is only with white z5c?if yes, Can I change for another color?"
"I bought this phone to replace iPhone 4S for my wife. I bought this phone based on my experience with Xperia Z3 for more than a year. I was impressed with the phone battery life, the normal usage definitely gets one full day. I still need to play with the settings to get to two full days of battery. The apps open up fast, the phone is very compact, easy for one-handed use. The finger scanner works very well."
excellent
"**SEE UPDATE BELOW**I've been using this phone for over 3 weeks now and I so glad I went with the Z5C.HARDWAREIt heats up a bit when doing heavy gaming or long video recordings, but not all too concerning...especially considering I don't notice any heat during typical daily operation. I would say the battery is adequate but it wouldn't be considered one of the strengths of this phone. I don't imagine battery life gets any better with other phones unless you go bigger...which, why the hell would you be looking at this phone if you were willing to do that? Go with the Xperia Z5. That said, I haven't experimented too much with ""stamina mode"" but if you use alternate messaging services / apps (like Google Voice) or music streaming apps, you'll have to add those apps as exceptions to be able to use data when the screen is off...which will diminish the benefit of ""stamina mode"" and preclude you from using ""ultra stamina mode"" all together. This is my first Quick Charge 2.0 device and I'm very impressed with how much charge you can get out of having it plugged in a just a while (ie 10 minutes). Wireless charging would've been nice to have but I'll gladly sacrifice that feature to get dual front facing speakers, expandable memory, and water resistance.Speaking of expandable memory. My buddy was playing with a camera-equipped drone his girlfriend got him for Christmas and was bummed he couldn't get the videos off the micro SD card (he didn't have an adapter). Everyone at the party (iPhone users) was blown away at how I was able to get and share the video by putting the micro SD card in my phone and using Google Drive to share it. I don't know why we are letting phone manufacturers sucker us by buying phones without expandable memory.At 720p screen resolution / quality looks great to me. If reading small text is difficult or annoying or you plan on watching HD full-length movies on your phone, get a bigger phone. I have excellent eyesight and find this display great for watching YouTube videos or reading articles.I don't take a lot of photos / videos but I'm pleased with the camera so far. You can find great camera comparisons online. From what I found this camera is great but Samsungs perform better in low-light and close up focusing...but the Z5C is a huge step up from my HTC One M7 when it comes to low light pictures.SOFTWAREI was a big fan of HTC's Sense UI and didn't know how I'd like Sony's UI as this is my first smartphone from them. After downloading an HTC-like free clock / weather widget, I like the UI a lot. Screenshots and screen capture are particularly easy and fun. Still waiting for Android 6.0 Marshmallow update that was promised (see summary below).SUMMARYAs far as I know the perfect phone doesn't exist but based on the other flagship phones available right now and my preference for water-resistance, expandable memory, and front facing speakers...I was prepared to give this phone a perfect 5 stars. I'm giving it 4 however because it would appear that Sony is following the lead of others by promising ""soon"" updates to the latest android version (6.0 Marshmallow) to help sell their new flagship phone but then making those of us who believed them and bought the phone wait around while the update is delayed. If the update comes prior to the new year I'll adjust my review to 5 stars. Almost 3 months for an update seems like enough time to tailor Marshmallow to their UI...if it was a priority.**UPDATE**This is the worst phone I've ever had. On paper it's great but I've never been so frustrated with lagging issue. I'll get a phone call while its in my hand and I'll mis the call because pushing ""answer"" is non-responsive. Killing apps helps a bit but I find myself restarting the phone a lot. I was hoping the Marshmellow update would help but its now March 8th & still no update. First & last time I buy a Sony phone. Since the Galaxy S7 is water resistant with expandable memory, I think I'll get it if a softwarw update comes soon & fixes my problems."
"Pros:+ Good display even with its only HD resolution still delivers vivid and beautiful colors.+ Good hardware specs (Snapdragon 810, 32 GB storage, 2 GB RAM).+ Good design & building Material.+ The place of the finger print sensor is in the same power button and the sensor response is perfect and fast.+ The size is just perfect if you want a small phone so you can handle it by one hand.+ Support SD card, one of the feature that most recent flagship phones now is missing.+ Good connectivity for both phone networks (support LTE, HSPA, GSM) and WiFi signals (support 2.4GHZ & 5 GHz).Cons:- The sound quality isn't one of the best.- The camera isn't that perfect specially with the auto focus.- The home screen little bit sluggish.- It could be much better if it has 3 GB of RAM."
"Excellent device, no other words to describe it. Don't think too much, just get it!"
Pros: Looks Size Camera Battery Life Screen quality (PPI) Screen to bezel ratio Front facing speakers Charging speed Multi-color LED notification light User interface Customizable Fingerprint scanner Dedicated camera button Clicky buttons Build qualtiy Water and dust proof Fast and responsive Micro SD card expandable storageCons: Doesn't work with Verizon
"Absolutely love this phone - battery life isn't as long as my Z3C, but I have 1-2 days out of it regularly.Supports QC 2.0, which is pretty awesome. I like the refined waterproofing design.This phone doesn't seem to jump/slide off everything like my Z3C - but I used the Ringke Fusion case for it anyway.The fingerprint unlock is an excellent feature - can be a little problematic, but usually gets it right on the 2nd/3rd try.I have a 200Gb Sandisk MicroSD installed - just about the right amount for Music/Pictures/Maps."
"Faulty product. Wifi failed to work, returned immediately."
My cousin loved it
"This is a fantastic phone.Sony did an excellent job with the user environment. It's only a little customised from stock Android and isn't always trying to sell you stuff like a Samsung device. The bloatware isn't too bad either and can be disabled. Sony includes a free service to locate, lock, or wipe your lost phone. Also software to copy over your old data. Very useful.Battery life really is good. My first day, it lasted until night which is quite good doing all of the setup and playing around. Under normal usage I have about 40% left at the end of the day--Wow! STAMINA mode seems really usable too for special times when you need extra battery life.The phone is small and very portable. It's not wafer thin, probably because of a larger battery. I don't find the thickness to be too much. Of course, with the smaller size you get a smaller screen. Is it worth the trade-off? Only you can decide.Performance is fast and flawless, which is unparalleled in a small phone. It doesn't seem to get particularly hot.The screen looks beautiful and the pixel density is plenty.I love the fingerprint sensor! Works great and so conveniently located. It's a shame they couldn't include this feature on the US model. I had Android encrypt the device for security, no problems.Volume control buttons seemed oddly placed at first, but they are out of the way and how often do you use them? Not that much.Camera, although it could be improved, is very usable as a compact camera. Dedicated camera button is very nice. Picture quality good, shutter delay fair.Water and dust sealing should be on EVERY phone. Great how it doesn't have fiddly flaps to cover all the ports.Audio quality is excellent and seems better than my old Samsung phone.No US warranty is unfortunate. If it breaks, I plan to pay for any repairs. I can live with the risk as a trade-off for the fingerprint scanner.Earbuds were included; thank you, Sony.Included charger had the international prong setup and included adapter for US outlets. Works fine, I have other chargers that work just as fine. Sometime I'll probably pick up a Quick Charge 2.0 charger.Overall, a super package! I'm so happy with it."
"Although the specs are good on paper, software bugs stop this phone from performing the simplest of tasks correctly.Hardware and build wise this thing is great. Button layout is perfect for one hand use. Bezel space is small, front stereo speakers are cool.Software wise... This phone is a joke. I had low expectations going in but was surprised at how bad it really is. The camera sucks, theres no way to say it's good at anything. Stereo speakers on front aren't same volume so it's a rather odd sound when viewing videos. Luminosity of auto brightness is all over the place, all of the time. And then there's overheating. The 810 in here should have been called dragons breath because it leaves the phone inoperable at times. I haven't shot 4k video or even played games yet and it gets above 170 just browsing the web. Charging the phone gets it to about 140 also.. and if you get a phone call or have to actually touch the phone, you get burned.All in all,if you're not a heavy user or you are coming from an iPhone, you'll probably like it. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."
display flickers! great cell phone with a great cam and functionality but the screen issue is a major problem that happened 1 month after purchase. I don't recommend to buy this cell.it looks a bit like this [...]
"The phone is compact and responsive but two real issues that are really bothersome:1. In the middle of a phone call, there is a 10 to 15 second pause when I hear a noise and the other party can't hear me. It corrects itself but does the same thing again after a minute or two on the call. I need to disconnect and call numerous times on a long call.2. The camera is nothing great. My old Samsung S4 has a better camera, especially in low light conditions. This takes very grainy pictures.Terrible experience. Very disappointed with Sony."
"The phone is doing great so far.Like the design and this size is perfect for me.I have used Z3 compact before, and Z5 compact runs faster.Definite a good choice if you want to have a smaller smart phone."
"Great phone, everything you need in small size. Just like I want.But when I received it, the box wasn't sealed, but still new.Thx"
"I agree with most of the other reviews that state that this is a great reasonably sized phone. Since they already detail the good parts, I'll spare you the extra words.That said, its battery life, size, and camera quality are marred by mediocre Bluetooth performance, camera app unresponsiveness, and poor stability.I've noticed Bluetooth audio with aptX can stutter. While it only happens twice in the included demo video (at 0:44 and 1:10), it can happen rather frequently if there's a lot going on in the background. It's very distracting whenever it happens. I strongly believe that the issue lies with the Z5C's aptX codec:* The headphones in question are the Plantronics BackBeat PRO Wireless Noise Canceling Hi-Fi Headphones with Mic - Compatible with iPhone, iPad, Android, and Other Smart Devices. In my testing, they work fine on the Nexus 4 and OnePlus One (Android phones that *don't* support aptX), and on an iPad and MacBook Pro (Apple devices that *do* support aptX).* Additionally, all of the non-aptX receivers I've tried with this phone work fine. As of this writing, this includes the Amazon Echo, Honda CR-V HandsFreeLink, JayBird BBX1MB BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Black (Discontinued by Manufacturer), and the HomeSpot NFC-Enabled Bluetooth Audio Receiver for Sound System.Despite the inclusion of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 in the phone, it's not very responsive. While taking a video, the camera app appears to stutter and drop a few frames every few seconds. It can be very difficult to stop taking a video - the phone will appear to still be capturing frames, but pressing the stop button can occasionally do nothing. Once the phone is in this state, nothing on the screen will respond including the back, home, and task switcher buttons (even though the camera still updates as you move the phone around). The only way out is to hard reboot (which can take up to three minutes if you have device encryption enabled). If you close the camera using the home button or the task switcher, the rest of the phone becomes very slow until you reopen the camera and close it using the back button.As for stability, I'll just leave the text of my initial 1-star review here:After successfully using this phone for navigation, I put it back in my pocket. When I took it out an hour later, it wouldn't turn back on. I could tell it wasn't a suddenly dead battery because the phone vibrated whenever I put my finger on the fingerprint sensor. I tried a hard reboot by removing and replacing the SIM card and the phone has been unresponsive since then.This is a real shame especially because there are no other decent phones on the market at this form factor (except maybe the Z3 Compact, which I've seen run into the exact same problem).Eventually I figured out that the problem was because Android crashed pretty hard since pressing and holding the ""OFF"" button hidden behind the SIM/SD cover brought the phone back to a working state."
"I got to say after 5 days of use, I absolutely love this phone. The small compact size is perfect for me and I don't mind the thickness, I assume it's thicker than most to put that bigger battery in. I thought it would be hard to go small since I'm coming from the iPhone 6 Plus, but wasn't bad at all in my opinion. This is actually the first android phone that I can say I won't be going back to my iPhone. I get about 1 1/2 days of battery life at moderate use. so far my screen on time averages 4 hours, best was 4 hours 45 minutes. My last android phone was the 2015 moto x pure and that battery life was horrible along with others I have owned, nexus 5x, Htc one m7, m8, m9, nexus 5, and so on which always made me go back to my iPhone along with other reasons. I am in the United States and with At&t and can confirm LTE works perfectly. No issues at all. Also I didn't have to manually put in the APN for mms or Internet to work, u just make sure u have wifi connected and then go to settings, then more, then scroll down and hit internet settings. Hit download and it will automatically download the correct settings for your carrier, make sure your carrier sim is installed. The camera is good enough for me, I'm no professional photographer so I just leave it in superior auto mode and it takes good pics in my opinion. I can confirm the phone back does get a little warm during some situations. First one was downloading all my apps from the play store at the same time. 2nd is using hangouts for video calls, other than that it has been fine. The heat it did get did not burn my hand and was still comfortable to hold and use. I did get the DP glass screen protector which I put on all my phones and I like it. I'm not a case kind of guy so waiting on my dbrand skin. I did get the white version and I have not had any screen issues or my on screen buttons not working on my bed. I assume others just got a defective unit. I got usb cord, earbuds, and a international plug in the box. Just a side not I only have one hand and am super happy that a company actually makes a one handed device with great specs. Most android phones I've had one handed use was very difficult if not impossible but had no choice if wanted top specs, so thank you Sony for high end specs in a compact size."
"One week after used it the phone start acting up, the screen frozen and intermittently lost signal.Not only that, the phone easily to get hot, I see many people has the same issues. I guess the phone it self has hardware problem. I return it back"
No problems yet at all. Met all expectations.
The screen does like crazy things on its own without user touching the screen hate product.
"Well done Sony, the phone is better than expected and I like the compact size, as I find the rest of the models too big for phones and not big enough for tablets ! ;)"
"Very bad GPS, and generally very unreliable... not expected of this ""high end"" expensive product."
"Okay, for those who encounter Bluetooth audio stuttering and choppy sound:after you connect your Bluetooth device, go to Setting -> App -> Running App -> terminate two services: sony screen mirroring and throw...this is a temporary and effective solution that I found with no root access required.I am wondering if Sony software engineers tested their software... Do they only listen music through wired headphone??sigh... their device is so great, but the software is so badly designed.. :(It could be alot better by just using stock android..."
"I really like it. It doesnt run hot, little warm,, but not hot at all. Great battery life and customization. Getting 5-6 SOT. Most all games run with no issues and good fps."
"Great phone, beautiful design, fast shipment"
"I had high expectations or this phone as a previous z1c and z3c owner. The z1c had the highest build quality in my opinion (the metal casing exuding the appearance of ""high-end""). The z5c is a step down from here, although the performance is updated, the phone does not look or feel high-end in your palm. This isn't a huge deal to me as I primarily use this phone for travel; the small size, waterproofing, and low-key appearance are all assets. However unlike the z1c, I don't enjoy using the z5c at home in the states. One big gripe for me has been the fingerprint scanner. The iPhone will read and unlock my prints 90% of the time, the z5c is probably more like 60% for me. I'm sure experiences will vary.In all its a mediocre phone, but given the choices out there, it is by far the best Android in this size. The vanilla-like Android experience Sony installs is appreciated as well-- its the closest you can get out of the box without buying a Nexus imho."
good
"I bought this for my wife, to replace her (still functional, just aging) Moto G LTE (1st Gen). If you're looking at this product, you're probably aware of the general lack of high-end, small-form-factor Android phones. If you want high-end, you usually have to get something substantially larger than this, and my wife did not want a larger phone. She also wanted something with a much better camera. The z5 compact delivers. She's had it a month now, and she likes it a lot. (I've used it quite a bit as well). The camera is responsive and extremely high quality - it does fairly well in low light as well. The battery life is nothing short of outstanding. Sony's take on Android squashes battery consumption when the phone is idle, even with background apps (facebook messenger, facebook, various google services) all running. I've used a moto x (1st gen), moto x (2nd gen), moto g LTE (1st gen) all recently -- this phone has markedly better battery life than those. It's also stable and fast - the only (very) minor gripe one could have about this phone is Sony's mild modification to the UI, which is not stock. I don't really like the blue menu bars on settings & so on, but once the thing is set up, you shouldn't have to go in to those... so this is mostly a nonissue. Also, the Sony/xperia migration tool made migrating sms messages, pictures, and so on a breeze. This phone is fantastic.Regarding cell coverage and compatibility, we use this phone with Cricket Wireless, which is an AT&T MVNO. The ""bars"" meter apparently is calibrated a bit lower than other phones (ie, displaying 3 bars vs 4, etc), but the actual dB reading is the same as my moto phones on the same carrier in the same location. I'd expect this phone to work absolutely fine with post-paid AT&T service as well, seeing as how it works without issue on their prepaid subsidiary. I cannot vouch for whether or not the carriers can actually activate a new SIM on this phone, however -- I took her old SIM (already activated), cut it, and put it in this phone, which worked fine. I did have to put in the access point (AP) settings, but that's standard practice if you're used to Cricket or other prepaid carriers.re: warranty, I get squaretrade warranties for phones anyway. I'm not sweating the alleged lack of US warranty, though other reports are mixed as to whether Sony would really give you the cold shoulder if you had a legitimate hardware issue with the device.The phone came with an international AC converter to convert it to US 120V to... something else. I live in the United States. I'm not intimately familiar with exactly what kind of converter this is. It comes with a US 120V to USB charger in the box, and then is bundled with this international AC-to-US120V-AC adapter outside. It also has a pair of earbuds in the box."
"too hot, the terrible 810"
"So this isn't actually black. It's a gunmetal grey. I originally settled for black because none of the other colors appealed to me and I am glad that I did now. The color of gunmetal grey looks wonderful and the phone itself is above and beyond all of the ""competition."" The phone is smaller than most smart phones these days but does anything and everything you want it to do. It even has one of the fastest (if not the fastest) processors onboard. My only issue is that it does get a little hot if you're using it for an extended amount of time to do anything too extreme. Wonderful phone though, I made sure to order plenty of tempered glass protectors for the front and back to ensure that I keep this little gem safe. Would highly recommend."
"Phone arrived in 2 days. I am a US customer looking to use the unit with ATT. I received it on Tuesday, and end of day Thursday today, the phone is fully setup customized and functional, but for the carrier. I had some lingering items to wrap up on my old phone, and today I'll be getting ATT service connected. My goal was to keep a smaller phone (~4.5"") like my previous unit to preserve the 1 handed capability, and convenient pocket fit. I don't want a tablet for a phone, and have struggled to find a good modern model match for my needs. The Z5C looked to be a great match, and so far, it's a perfect fit for me.Package appeared to have been opened, however carefully, and then re-sealed. I suspect the reason it was opened was the addition of a US plug adapter for the EU style plug the unit comes with, as it does not look like a Sony converter. Where the phone uses a pretty standard 5V, 1500mA mUSB charger, of which I have a bunch, this wasn't a big deal. All other packages in the box (headphones, USB cable, extra earbud cushions, documents) were all intact and looked brand new, untouched. Phone itself still had original sticky film and packaging, and was in perfect new condition.Phone turned right on, and was ~60% charged. I was prompted quickly to change the language (second or third screen) as I ran setup from German to English I organized the OS as I prefer my phone laid out and set up and connected to wifi. The phone immediately ran two major system updates in parallel, and then after a restart, ran another. I'm now on Android 5.1.1, and admittedly, I'm not sure what it shipped with before the updates as they happened so fast.I love the square edges, which allow for some grip in a smartphone world where everything is slick and like holding onto a watersock if you don't have a cover on it. The phone looks like a sleek, black slab of sexy tech. Seriously, what a cool looking, striking design. The photos don't do it justice. I did buy a low profile cover for drop protection, and have used it intermittently. Compared to the IPhone 6 or the new Galaxy Edge, this is much easier to hold one handed without worrying about it squirting onto the pavement. That said, it's still a pretty slick and smooth piece of hardware in general, and I'd suggest a cover/protection.The phone is a great unit, and a perfect fit for my needs. I love the frosted glass back, the large screen/body ratio, and the charcoal colored polycarb frame.. I know some people take stars away for not liking the case/finish (non metal), but I find that odd. If you don't like it, why'd you drop $500 on it? It's a first class material, so the rest is just opinion. It actually has a pretty metallic look anyways. No one's going to look at this and say ""man, what a cheap looking phone. I promise. Phone does get a bit warm (which I really only experienced during the initial startup/setup), but there's a lot of horsepower in there, and that's to be expected. Nothing that bothered me.The fingerprint tech is awesome, and responds quickly and flawlessly. I have a few different fingers stored so that it's a comfortable unlock both righty and lefty. The hardware is clearly sufficient, as I've had a dozen things going on at once including downloading, a bluetooth beam, installing and updating apps, surfing a few internet tabs and writing a note all at once, and Android ran smooth, slick, quick and didn't break a sweat. Phone a very *solid* feel, very high quality, and certainly a first class phone that can be discussed in the circles of the current high end smartphone competition.Two minor drawbacks that I didn't think were worth removing a star for:1) No wireless charging. If the unit didn't have the rapid charge capability, this may have been a -1, but it charges so damned fast, and keeps charge so long, I couldn't do it. Still would be cool to drop it on those powermats at starbucks. Oh well.2) Volume buttons are too low on the thumb side (righty.) These should have been up top. I'm guessing there was a hardware conflict, but either way, it's a nitpick worth mentioning.Setup with personal and work emails was seamless, and calendar, emails and contacts all downloaded via wifi quickly and easily.I'm headed to ATT to finalize my new account and get the carrier service completed. Unless you see a follow up note from me, assume it also went smoothly."
"Great smartphone, excellent build quality, screen size, and hardware (64bit octacore Snapdragon 810 processor). If you are looking for something comparable in size to the iPhone but want more options and memory and no iOS then this is the perfect device for you and the fingerprint scanner on the power button was a brilliant idea.Due to the 64 bit processor and the 810 processor instructions 2gb of memory has no lag compared to the same system running on a 80x series processor.Great job Sony!Update 12/23/2015I am returning this device constantly runs hot ~143F without video recording, when using google maps or other apps, just beware."
"Pros:One of the better small screen phones still available on the market.Water resistance means you can wash it when it gets dirty, and you won't need to worry about dust getting inside, as long as the flaps are closed properly.Good for one handed usage.Fingerprint scanner works very well.Cons:I got a defective unit with a front camera that partially works. A portion of the picture will turn out yellow due to the broken camera.The design pretty much means this phone is only usable in the right hand. Not very nice for a lefty phone holder."
"I've had a Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, and S4. I understand some people like big phones, however, that's not my preference. That's why when the S5 came out, I started looking for something else. Then I found the Sony's Xperia Z Compact phones. I had originally wanted the Z3+ (Z4 elsewhere), but right when I was about to buy it, the Z5 Compact came out. While it's not available in the US via normal retailers, I was able to get a warranty for it via SquareTrade. So that made it a no brainer for me. I've had it for a few months now and I'm still loving it."
I love this phone!
"Love this phone the camera is amazing the features is awesome, plus I get to play my ps4 on my phone"
"The best phone of the moment!!!! This little device is amazing!!! And no, its not a mini tablet, is a smartphone so the size is just perfect!"
"great phone and great style. It gets a tad warm when apps like snapchat are open for a long time. Other than that it's perfect, quick, and stylish."
Very good phone
"Love this phone. Just as good as the Z3 compact. Great battery life, perfect size, and love the waterproofness. No problems with overheating."
"I ordered this phone for my wife who was using an iPhone 4. The phone arrived in a few days (faster than expected). The box was sealed, so I was confident it was new as advertised. Out of the box it had 52% battery. I started the setup process and connected it to my home wifi network. The phone then told me it needed to perform a software upgrade. I said yes, and this process took about 15 minutes. I then took the phone to a nearby AT&T store to have them install a nano-SIM card. In 10 minutes this process was completed without any issues. It connected to the AT&T network in my home state of NY. So far, I'm very happy with this phone."
Overall good!
"I think it was mildly used, there were Chinese apps installed on it, a Chinese user logged on and the plastic on it was slightly pulled off.But it was in a good condition and nothing is wrong with it so far."
"The weight and size of this phone are ideal in my opinion. It is also very very fast, water resistant, very good battery life, looks very good, unreal 4k video(tested and impressed... pausing the video looks like a photo even on a large monitor), has a clear sharp display, great audio and a fantastic (for a phone) camera. I loved my Sony ZL phone, got it wet so then went to the Z1 which is great but too big and heavy for me. This is the best phone out there for my needs right now and I believe this size of phone will make a huge comeback as it is truly ideal, great job Sony! (PS I am on T-Mobile and I don't think I am getting LTE but still quite fast and battery drain is not an issue)"
"I bought this phone as a replacement for my Z1 which I had for over two and half years. I had zero issues with it until I shattered the screen. The Xperia line of phones are touted as being waterproof or at least they were initially. Sony seems to have shied away from that position now and for good reason. You see, I originally bought the Z1 for three main reasons: the 20mp camera, water resistance, build quality. My experience with the Z1 lead me to believe that the Z5c would be a suitable replacement. I assumed that the Z5c would certainly exceed the standards set by the Z1. I was wrong.Firstly, the positives1) The camera of the Z5c does outperform the Z1's especially in low light conditions. The overall picture quality is only slightly better, however.2) The UI is smoother and faster, likely due to the more powerful CPU3) Slightly better battery life4) Twice the storage capacity5) No flap cover for the USB slot6) Louder speakersThe negatives1) Plastic frame. The phone feels cheap compared to the Z1. It also is less damage resistant than the metal Z12) Frosted glass back plate. While it looks nice, it makes the phone slick and therefore harder to hold3) Build quality and water resistanceI assumed that the Z5c would be even more watertight than the Z1 since it has a higher IP certification. Nope. Even though I swam with my Z1 dozens of times, occasionally exceeding its depth rating, I never once had any issues. I would even wash it in the sink weekly. The phone was waterproof until I broke the screen. The Z5c, on the other hand, died the very moment it touched water. It was thoroughly waterlogged as if it lacked a water resistant seal entirely.Sony's repair service only made matters worse. They claimed that my Z5c was made for the Polish market (what?) and that there are no repair centers in the US. I was given an address in England to ship it and they said they would pay for Royal Mail shipping. Naturally, they could not seeing as how there are no Royal Mail offices in the US. Despite paying for shipping, Sony fixed the phone free of charge since it was under warranty. The turn around time was a bit over a month. I believe I got lucky as I have read that Sony will not honor warranty claims that are the result of water damage.So I go to turn the phone on and all seems well. At this point, I'm just glad to finally have my phone back. However, to my dismay the volume key does not work. They replaced the screen along with many internal components and performed a diagnostics test and yet somehow the broken volume key passed the test. What the heck. Every Xperia phone lets you run a simple pass/fail diagnostic test in the settings menu. One of the tests is for the volume rocker key. I don't understand how they missed this.I reached out to Sony again who said to ship the phone to them. And so I did. Over three weeks went by before I asked them for a status update. They told me they did not receive my phone. Strange. USPS stated that it passed customs and marked it as delivered. A couple more weeks go by before I receive an international package at my door. I thought maybe they had fixed my phone without notifying me. A foolish thought. What happened was that the Sony Service Center refused to take possession of the package so it was returned to me. Apparently there was a customs fee that they would not pay, despite stating that they would pay for shipping both ways. Since I paid for shipping to them both times they could have at least paid the measly fee. Why would Sony pays for it the first time but not the second? I asked USPS if I could pay the fee upfront and I was told I cannot.I've had it with Sony. Clearly the quality of their phones isn't what it used to be, not to mention the quality of their customer service. I'll update this review if Sony rectifies the situation. Don't hold your breath though."
"Phone is awesome. Finall, now I own a phone with speakers to the front lol Only wished it had come with some headphones. Everything these days are more expensive and coming with less. Atleast I got the charger :-)"
"Bought a Sony Xperia Compact white in January. After a month of use, the screen started giving trouble, now I cannot use it. I replaced the screen, formatted the phone, and nothing works. Also, since it does not come with warranty, I had to cover the costs myself. All in all, I could have gotten a Samsung S7 Edge for all my money. Please do not buy the compact White models, they have been faulty."
Excellent smartphone
The phone is great. Thanks
"Great all-around android device; love the size & shape. Fits well into any pocket, including women's jeans! (This was a problem for me with larger phones.) Fingerprint scanner is a great feature and the camera is great; I haven't tested how waterproof it is yet, but it's nice to not worry about it in rain etc. Software all runs smoothly and I have yet to come up on anything the phone struggles to do.Rated down by 1 star as it tends to heat up and drain battery relatively quickly, though. It's excellent in 60º (F) weather where the air temp naturally compensates, but as it gets up to 80s or 90s the battery just burns up if you're using the screen a lot."
"OK I didn't wanna post any review within a few days of my possession to avoid looking like snap judgment. So I had this phone for about a month now and I gotta say I'm very pleased with it. The display is so beautiful and the clarity is high. Even on low brightness. I thought the screen might be too small for me but it's perfect. I have small hands myself. Now I don't have to stretch my thumb across the screen to text messages. I can text comfortably with one hand. The battery life is just AWESOME!!!! Coming from a MOTO X that could barely last one day, I was afraid the battery life won't be as good for this phone. And I was so wrong. I can easily use this device for two and half days straight without charging it. That includes internet browsing, data using, video and music usage, picture taking and basic calling/texting. Remember still turn off your phone once awhile, it's like a computer, it needs to rest sometime. Anyhow, the only thing that is not too great about this phone is the camera. Don't get me wrong. It takes great and clear pictures. I like the feature that you can choose what to focus when there are multiple things in one frame. The shutter speed sucks. It takes a few seconds for a photo to take a photo. That was pretty disappointing. I did insert a SD card later on and it did help with the speed a little but not too much. But out of all the good things about this phone, I can let one slide. Nothing is perfect right?"
"Purchased on February, now reviewing during August.The Sony Z5 Compact is a great little device with plenty of powerful features.Specs:2GB ramQualcomm Snapdragon 81023 MP Back Camera (wow!)5 MP Front CameraMicro USB Charging Port4.6 inch Touch Screen DisplayIP 68 Waterproof, Dust proof, etc.Micro SD and Nano SIm card slotsReview:Wow!, I'm surprised Sony was able to compact their larger Z5 into such a small body that is convenient for your pocket and your hand. It is truly some remarkable engineering. Well, that compact size does have a drawback that may put some people off which is that it is a blocky/bulky phone. Even though it is a blocky/bulky phone, I always managed to get a nice firm grip because of the size and bulk of the phone. The screen size is perfect in my opinion for the size of this phone which is the same screen size for the iPhone 6/6s. The phone is also waterproof and dustproof which was sort of a minor, yet surprising, thing that Sony would usually put on their phones that is beginning to be used by other phone companies such as Samsung. The Camera packs 23 MP which is quite surprising for the size of the phone. The camera takes good pictures and good videos, HOWEVER, in only good lighting. If you take pictures in the dark, It will appear murky and pixelated. The phone's software experience has been vastly improved from its early beginnings and has lost almost all of its setbacks it had when it started. Sony's android skin is fast and simple, offering a near stock Android Marshmallow experience. The Speakers produce good sound but are located in the most convenient location that most phone companies ignore. The speakers are located in the front with one on top near the camera and one on the bottom. This means you don't cover the speakers when ever you're watching a video in landscape. Most companies put the speakers at the bottom of the phone next to the Micro USB charging port. The biggest grip of the phone is the processor that is encased in it which is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810. This CPU has a well known record of producing more heat than most of other CPUs in the market. This CPU is very powerful and still relevant even with Qualcomm's new CPU the Snapdragon 820, but it just gets hot very quickly. The heat isn't hot to the touch where it is unbearable it just gets warm when gaming, browsing the web, watching videos, etc. The battery life on this phone is great and it usually has enough charge to last me for a whole day and some the day afterwards. This is, However, if you utilize Sony's STAMINA Battery saver feature. You can still get a whole days worth without it, but you will probably have to cut back on CPU intensive tasks. Overall, this phone offers the strength and speed of its older counterpart(Z5) in a neat little package that doesn't make it uncomfortable in the pocket.Pros:Speed and power( CPU).Small and convenient package.Great front and back cameras.Great battery life.Speaker location is very good and sound great.Waterproof.Cons:CPU gets warm very quicklyCamera quality isn't very good in low light conditions.The thickness of the phone may put off some people.Will Update if necessary."
The headphone jack has started malfuctioning within 3 months of use.
Excellent phone! Had the Samsung Galaxy it is over rated. Sony has done an amazing job. Top quality
I like the phoneHowever it arrived in a soaking wet box. Completely not even a box anymore. Good thing the phone was waterproof and I know how to read a manual online.
First week and im enjoying this thing! Has nice speakers and perfect camera for a compact phone. This is a complete package.
"It's small, it's functional, an elegant black rectangle"
"First, I want to warn you that I have always loved Sony phones since it was Sony Ericsson. I still remember one of my older phones was a Sony Ericsson K550 that had a 2MP camera but produced pictures with the highest quality. After a disappointment with a Sony Ericsson C901 I decided to switch to Nokia from 2009 until 2013 when I bought a Sony Xperia GO that worked perfectly for 27 months until this November.I decided to buy a Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and after one week I think I can share my experience with all of you.This is a good phone. I know some people would never even consider getting a Sony phone but even they admit Sony is just quality. This phone has an excellent hardware and the way it integrated with the software (Lollipop working perfectly) is what I would call excellence. Connectivity is good since I can connect to 4G (LTE) without any trouble but you need to make sure this phone supports your carrier’s LTE band.Call quality (Let’s remember we still make phone calls with smartphones) is good and I have not had any issues with reception at all. The phone is thick but not as extremely thick as some people have complained. It’s noticeable in your pocket but nothing gross. It’s not heavy or uncomfortable. I have to mention at this point that inserting the SIM card and the memory card is not easy. I swear I’ll never open those slots again. I inserted a 64GB memory card and it’s working flawlessly.The screen delivers beautiful colors and the resolution is excellent. I know some people have complained it could have been better but still is very good. One of the main reasons I love Sony Xperias is because they usually have anti-scratch protection and I witnessed it with my previous Sony Xperia Go as it never got a single scratch in 27 months. The camera has been controversial in some reviews. Look, I know we should believe that smartphones will replace digital cameras but guess what? I don’t think so. The camera takes very good pictures and delivers excellent videos but it’s true it is not perfect. However, the camera is good for most occasions.Sound quality is excellent. I used PowerAMP for my music and this phone has a special feature to improve the overall sound quality with headsets (DSEE HX). It works perfectly and I haven’t had to arrange and tweak the PowerAMP equalizer all over as I did with my previous Sony Xperia GO.Battery life is good but not as other smartphones. If you listen to a lot of music (like me) you’ll need to charge the phone every single day. This is not a problem for me but I know some people might not like it. However, I have to mention that one day I almost didn’t use it and it just discharged from 99% at 7AM to 90% at 7PM so it really depends on usage. Another advantage is that it charges very quickly.The phone is very responsive and I have not experienced any bugs or lags as someone reported before. The camera works pretty well when I click on it taking just one second for the app to open.At this point you must be asking why I’m giving it only 4 stars and I am going to tell you why: heat.Unfortunately, the phone does get warm when you update apps or run another “intensive” process. It’s not all the time so I think Sony has done something maybe not to fix the problem they had before but at least to alleviate it. I want to clarify it gets warm – nothing extreme but still noticeable.This is an excellent phone, really. It’s quality and performance all in one but the heating issue should have been fixed by Sony at this point."
Used to be a z3 compact user.z5 compact is better than z3c.
"Out of the box, the phone was in Chinese and it took a while to get the setting correct. The phone also did not work perfectly after popping in the sim card. I used the phone on AT&T and to activate data on AT&T I had to setup the APN. The instructions are available on AT&T's website.The fingerprint sensor is a good feature; However, I also using an iOS base iPhone 6, and I find too few apps on android fully utilization the feature and I find myself falling back to my iOS device its integration into the apps.Dedicated camera feature is amazing and the new layout of the micro usb is excellent. It feels much more well built than the z3 compact. Speeds are good w/few hiccups."
Took a while but excelent product
good
Awesome piece of kit
"Great phone, I was worried about the phone getting warm, so far no probelm at all (stays cool almost all the time- switching from Iphone).this Compact phone is waterprrof, has an octacore processor...best phone in the market...works great on Tmobile."
Phone has screen problem making it almost unusable... No warranty and $400+ down the drain. Very very unhappy.
Works as advertised.I wanted a phone that fit in my hands and pocket as a small person.Being able to text with one hand is a plus for me too.
"The phone has been working well so far, but I was disappointed by the thickness which is higher than my previous phone."
Great little phone
"This is awesome deal. Personally I like a compact device. In compact class, this is one of the best smartphone that I ever."
I love my Sony Xperia z5 compact!! It's comparable in size to the iPhone 5c just right for me and having an amazing sound and picture quality is a huge bonus!!!!
Not recommended to water
"This thing gets hot. I have a smart watch and due to some ultra sensitive touch screen it turns on in my pocket a lot. So two day battery life is totally a joke, Im lucky if i get a full day. I really love this phone and the camera is great but the battery is not as great as they say. side note the fingerprint scanner is about 80% accurate."
"Initially everything went well, however, the phone stopped charging in less than 7 months after purchasing from seller. The phone is defective as it should work longer than seven months. I would not recommend seller or phone products given my experience with both seller and/or their products.."
"The staff was dilevered in time, very fast. The quality correspond to price. Thanks for cooperation a lot."
"Looking for a small sized phone that packs a lot of power? Then this is for you. I may be in a minority but I just don't see the need for phones to be the size that they are right now. I wanted something small enough to operate with one hand and to easily fit in my pocket.My previous phone was an original Moto X and that was a great size for me so I wanted something similar, but all of the OEMs were only producing these massive devices that require two hands to operate. I mean really, how am I supposed to text and drive if I have to take both hands off the wheel? (That's a joke, NEVER text and drive.)So I did tons of research, using the phone comparison feature on sites like gsmarena.com to check the physical dimensions. The other problem was that when I did find a ""small"" phone, it usually had terrible specs. A dumbed down processor from 2 generations ago, not much memory, and often a mediocre camera.Then I found the Sony Xperia Z5 compact. This phone is small but it doesn't skimp on performance. It actually has the same processor as Google's flagship Nexus 6P, so it's blazing fast. Comes with 2GB ram (the 6P has 3GB though I believe) and 32GB built in storage which is easily expanded with an microSD card. Camera is top notch too, being from Sony who has been making cameras and camera lenses for a long time. The other nice thing is the battery life, since it has a good sized battery paired with a smaller screen, the screen actually drains the battery less than on the bigger devices. When I first bought it, I was easily getting 2 days of battery life but now that is more like a day or day and a half depending on my usage.I actually ordered it here unlocked because nobody else is carrying it in the US. When mine arrived, the menus were all in Chinese, but a quick YouTube search showed me how to switch them back to English and I was all set.I'm a big Android fan so I was weary of what kind of bloatware Sony might have installed on this. But it's really not bad at all and feels very similar to a pure android experience. There are a few little things that are different and you can uninstall any of the Sony pre-installed apps without any issue. Mine was also recently OTA'd to Marshmallow which seemed to improve performance quite a bit.Overall, I'm so happy I bought this phone. It's the perfect size if you're looking for a small Android device and has enough processing power to keep up with the latest devices. Oh, the built in fingerprint scanner in the power button is super nice too, as is the physical camera shutter button. Both of these are features I use daily. (Note: I heard that the US spec phones won't have the fingerprint scanner, so be sure to check if that matters to you.)"
good
"I really wanted to like the Xperia Z5 Compact. It had all the things I wanted and it was the right size for my hands. However, it would not communicate with my internet provider. I had contacts with Sony and with Verizon and followed all their advice as to how to fix it. They both ended up blaming the other. So there was no recourse for me but to send it back."
"I love this phone! The size is perfect. It fits in my pocket just fine. The ability to record in 4k is really cool and the quality of the video seems very very nice, even when just played back on the phones display. The display is very sharp and gave me a headache for a day or two but I seem to have adjusted now. Apps load very fast. I am using the At&t nano sim through straight talk and everything is working just fine.The only downside so far is the camera loads fairly slow. My boyfriends iPhone 6 loads the camera and takes six photos by the time this phone loads and takes one. Other than that I am overall pleased with the phone."
I love it
I love it
It was everything I was expecting it to be
"I bought the Sony Xperia Z5 compact and so far it's been a terrific phone. I love this phone so much because it has a long battery life, Android marshmellow, and good camera but let me tell you about the cons.Cons: my number 1 reason why I HATE this phone is the fingerprint lock. My friends saw some private pictures of my girlfriend and I., I was harassed me. it's suppose to be under my fingerprint and my friends can access itSecond: I got in a car rekt after the beach and my phone was dead. It Cannot charge in ANY car. I tried to use multiple chargersThird: I get made fun of cause this phone apparently looks old"
"it was set in Chinese language, was a challenge to turn it to english. But other than that, it works and looks great"
"Good phone, just a little small for me, and the camera is a little slow to wake, things like battery life and general performance are great though, if you need something small and powerful you cant go wrong here."
"This phone is a hard-to-find size unless you decide to join the dark side and buy Apple. I was looking for a multi function (smart) phone not a tablet that also has a phone. For me, bigger is not better. The phone is fast, has enough storage for most people and also that storage can be expanded by up to 100Gb via SD card. After reading the write-ups, I decided that this was the right one. I then had to decide which model, US or International and which vendor. I chose the international model, E5823 because it was a tad lower price but more importantly has the fingerprint reader (left off of the E5803, US model). There were two other criteria - would Sony honor the warranty in the US? Answer from Sony, yes. It may take a couple more days to process, but no warranty issue. Their service center is in Laredo Texas. Also, I wanted to know where I might have to return the phone if it arrived DOA (it didn't). Some vendors require shipping back to Europe or Hong Kong at a cost of $50-$60. No way on that. I chose to buy from CANGURO through Amazon. They are in Chicago and back the product from there. They answered all of my questions. EXCELLENT seller! There is one issue with the phone and it's a software issue. It was not enough for me to downgrade the rating, but might be an issue for you. After upgrading to Android 6.0, Marshmallow, the FM radio freezes after 15-20 minutes. It sometimes requires re-booting the phone to exit the app. Sony has promised a fix."
Great phone... Arriving at time.
"I bought this phone to replace my Z3 Compact.It's an improved version, so it excels the previous one, but has a major bug. The phone randomly shuts down once or twice every day! Just from nothing, freezes and restarts. Quite annoying, it takes ~2 minutes... I ve tried what the support team said i should do, but didn't fix the issue. As i bought it without warranty im sticking with a brand new useless phone. Also, this happened to A LOT of people."
"great smartphone, excelent service"
"Not very serious with the time delivery, the device it's ok to use in Mex. with Telcel and US with T-mobile"
awesome
"Great phone, feels a bit thicker than my Z1 though."
"Overall, this has been a great device. The camera is very laggy, but it seems to be a software issue that Sony is aware of. Hopefully they fix it. Otherwise, solid phone!"
"Long story short: this is the phone that finally convinced me to make the jump from Apple's iOS. I had been considering making the jump for some time, but I had yet to find an Android phone that matched the build quality and performance of my iPhone 6S. The z5 Compact finally did convinced me.Pros:+ Same size screen as the iPhone 6S, despite being smaller and lighter.+ Excellent build quality - the phone feels premium, solid and well made. I don't worry about anything breaking if I drop it once or twice.+ Waterproof!+ Very little manufacturer bloatware, especially compared to Samsung or LG. Among other things, this means that future Android updates will hit this phone sooner than many other Android devices.+ I actually most of the bloatware that's included. Sony's launcher is fast and responsive - I'm actually using it instead of the official Google launcher.+ Camera is high quality.+ Better battery life than my iPhone 6s+ Fingerprint scanner+ Plenty of processing power - I haven't yet seen the phone slow down or choke on any app I've thrown at it.Cons:- Cases options for this phone in the U.S. are limited when compared to the dancing plethora of iPhone cases that flood every electronics store, website, gas station and grocery store.- Because this is the international version of the phone, there's no warranty- Because this is the international version of the phone, some apps think I'm in Ireland. I'm sure a simple setting could easily change this, but I haven't yet found it.- Fingerprint scanner doesn't work as well as iPhone 6S (though it's still good). I think this is mainly due to the fact that the scanner is smaller than the iPhone scanner, so it has less to work with.Overall, I've found this phone to be the perfect fit for me. It really hits the sweet spot of combining the power, battery life, screen size and non-bloated OS that I've been looking for."
"The phone is good, stable, small. But when my phone cracked, Sony was really competing with five-ply-a$$wipe on the scale of efficient and successful support. Seriously. If you ever expect that you'll need to call Sony to fix something that might have gone wrong, just get a different device and don't look back."
"This phone is exactly what I was looking for. More compact so I can actually hold and utilize it with one hand, still water proof for random spills and drops in the pool, and great photos!I had a little trouble at first because I forgot all of the little things one must do to get a network unbranded phone to work. Also, if you don't remove the plastic screen protector that comes on it in the box, it will disrupt your ear proximity sensor.Some things you'll have to check if you want full functionality of your phone will be your SMS service center number, APN access point network for Internet and Lte to work, network settings in general. All of this info is available online, so don't be deterred. It's very easy to just type in a couple of numbers and enjoy your new phone."
"If you're looking for a compact phone, this is the one to get. Compact size without sacrificing CPU and other features like most other ""mini"" phones. I am using this on AT&T in the USA.Pros:- Battery life is astounding. I usually go to bed with ~40% battery after a day of use.- Compact size - so awesome. Hate how big most phones are these days, this is the perfect size for me- Fast. ""Flagship"" phone specs but in a compact size.- Fingerprint scanner. Love this. I hate lock screens but I am required to use them for a few apps, and company policy. Fingerprint scanner works pretty well.- Smart lock - nice feature that is new to me. Auto-unlocks the phone based on certain conditions, such as if certain bluetooth devices are connected, by location (while at home for example) and/or other criteria. Makes having a lock screen much less of a pain.- Dedicated camera button, press and hold to power on the phone and open camera, nice for quick photos- Dual front-facing speakers. Very loud, sound is decent, a bit tinny, but that's expected from such a small device.- Great screen, very clear and bright, no complaints there- Did I mention it's tiny?Cons:- Camera is pretty mediocre. I'm not a big camera user but for some this may be a dealbreaker. My 4 year old HTC One M7 took far better pictures.- Now that I've had it several months, the fingerprint scanner is getting a little glitchy. Most of the time a reboot fixes the problem, but usually comes back after a couple days. Definitely annoying.- Case options are pretty limited, and many of them cover the power button therefore disabling the use of the fingerprint scanner.- 720p resolution. Honestly I don't consider this a downside at all, who wants to watch 1080p video on a 4"" screen anyway. But for some, resolution is important.- Personally I don't like the factory dialer. I almost always dial by number and this one pulls up a list of contacts by default and takes an extra tap to get the keypad. Slightly annoying, but easily fixed with 3rd-party dialers in the Play store.- Gorilla Glass. Hotly debated, but this phone doesn't have it. Sony uses their own proprietary tempered glass, supposedly just as scratch-resistant as Gorilla Glass. I've own the phone for 3 months now and have zero scratches, and survived a couple drops."
"Nice compact pocket sized phone. A very decent photo camera.Compared to my old Z1 compact, it's much better in every sense and at normal affordable price.The fingerprint opening works mostly ok and is quite useful"
"Stay away from this phone.I purchased this phone less than a year ago. From the beginning the phone was a little slow to respond in many ways but I could deal with it. About 3 months ago the camera stopped working entirely. I called customer support and was told to do a soft reset, then hard reset. Neither of those worked.I asked about sending the phone in for repair and was informed that because this model came from Hong Kong, that they could not repair it, it is not covered under warranty, I would have to contact the Hong Kong customer service. I have been back and forth between both Hong Kong and US customer service, both of them just give me the run around and refuse to take responsibility for their faulty product, and will not repair it. After contacting the US customer service again, they advised me to do a software repair. I followed the steps and now my phone is entirely stuck on the beginning intro screen and will not function at all. In other words, right now I paid over $500.00 for a non functioning phone with Sony refusing to fix their faulty product.This phone is a giant lemon, and after dealing with Sonys customer service I will never purchase a Sony product again."
"If you want an Android *phone* - not a mini-tablet, something that fits in your hand and doesn't feel like a plate of armor in your front pocket - Sony is now the only game in town (and not in any USA towns...these are imports). I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings.I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the ""lip"" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases.I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone.Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled.Just buy it. I hope Sony sells enough to make Z5 Compact successors."
"Love it. Had the z3 compact for one year and made the upgrade mainly for the fingerprint sensor that, although it's not as good as the one on the iphone 6s, works alright. Also, the camera is a bit better (though the one on the z3 compact was already something amazing) and... what else? overall it looks better, nicer, more premium feel to it ;) I miss magnetic charging though..."
"I have bought phone of white color. Excellent design, ideal size, powerful hardware! Only one drawback - at start of some power applications phone is heated. 9,5 points from 10."
"Nice Smartphone, excellent service. Great experience."
"I love this phone! The size is perfect. It fits in my pocket just fine. The ability to record in 4k is really cool and the quality of the video seems very very nice, even when just played back on the phones display. The display is very sharp and gave me a headache for a day or two but I seem to have adjusted now. Apps load very fast. I am using the At&t nano sim through straight talk and everything is working just fine.The only downside so far is the camera loads fairly slow. My boyfriends iPhone 6 loads the camera and takes six photos by the time this phone loads and takes one. Other than that I am overall pleased with the phone."
"I love this phone. Personally, I like my mobile phones to be mobile. I don't want to look like I'm talking to a graphing calculator. It's fast, has a great camera, and fits in all my pockets."
"I've had it two months now and it freezes constantly, heats up really hot every single time I use it, even for a few minutes. It also shuts down apps all the time randomly. The battery is suddenly horrible, it drops 10% everytime I use it so it's dead halfway through the day, then it won't charge, and when you finally get it to charge it will charge all night and still not be at 100. I even deleted everything off my phone to make it run better but it did not change anything. Worst phone I've ever had. Don't waste your money."
It is so beautiful a phone with great camera.
great
"the phone is awesome i like it very much and beside the fact that it fit in y pocket, it`s fast and full of surprises the camera is wonderful it is the phone i was looking for."
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTno doubt innovative design and power but it suffers from two major flaws:1) very very buggy software, Sony mobile did a crappy job implementing the Android platform for this device - camera app crashes all the time, and the it looks like the software is not using the hardware properly and ultimately providing sub optimal performance for a device of this class, especially the camera lag and results quality despite the high specs.2) Heat - when i bought this phone i read many reviews saying that the snapdragon 810 inside is hotter but it only noticeable when capturing a 4K video ( which i wouldn't care less about ) . the truth is that the device is always hot, even on standby, even what doing simple operations like texting and browsing through some pictures. the battery seemed to drain relatively quickly. reading from other reviews it looks like Sony has a serious problem with their QA. what a shame from a technology giant such Sony to ship such a beta product.better go with GX S6 edge which is lighter, more powerful and more assurance about the quality and updates the device will receive along the way."
"I'm still getting used to it but I have to say, it is a very nice device."
"My previous phone was Xperia Z1 and I really loved it so I decided to stick with the brand. I would say that the experience with Z5 is fairly similar - everything is fast and smooth, the camera is nice. This phone apparently came from Hong Kong (or something like this). I had to look at my old phone to figure out how to change the language. In the beginning I was afraid that things won't work properly, but everything has been fine so far (after 2 months of use)"
"Worst cellphone I have ever used. It looked cute and worked fine for the first three weeks. And all kinds of problem shows up. After I upgraded the system, I can't access to my cellular data. I found the instruction online and fixed that manually. I can't use my group message at all.Apparently SONY never realized that normal people will group text each other. My music app starts to play by itself out of blue, which gave me couple of embarrassing moments during meetings.Then the screen cracked. Well, that was my fault. I fixed that by spending 170 dollars more on this stupid phone. And then the front camera is broken. Just to make a double down, my text function starts to fail. My screen turned completely black when I am making a phone call.I don't think SONY is even trying to sell their cellphones. I bought it because it's cute. But I can't even use it as a simple cellphone. NEVER ever ever buy this phone."
Ok
"I love this phone, I was a little worried about the overheating reports but phone run cool even after 20 min of FHD recording on my last beach day."
"Great phone, I was worried about the phone getting warm, so far no probelm at all (stays cool almost all the time- switching from Iphone).this Compact phone is waterprrof, has an octacore processor...best phone in the market...works great on Tmobile."
"I use the cellphone for 5 days. Today I charge the battery for a while, when I get it, it was very overheated. I could not even turn it off for many hours when the battery finished. I would like to talk with the seller."
"Great Phone, the UI is the really cool, it feels and look awesome."

I hope Sony sells enough to make Z5 Compact successors."
"This is the best phone I have ever had. The main features I was looking for in a new phone were small size and battery life and I don' think it gets any better than the Z5 compact. My previous phone was a Droid Mini because it was the smallest Android phone available on Verizon. I was hesitant to switch from Verizon because I had been with them for a decade, but I have had no problems so far on AT&T and the Z5 Compact performs great and feels great (much better than the plasticky Droid Mini). In terms of battery life I would take the Mini off of the charger at 7am and with light-average usage it would be dead by 4pm. The same routine with the Z5 Compact always shows more than 65% battery remaining at 4pm."
"It takes around 5 seconds to open the camera, which is very disappointing. The phone heats up very easily while doing intensive tasks. Size is comfortable to hold but the screen is a little worse than expected because it's 720p only. I returned this phone, but the most disappointing is that it's been three days since the return package arrived at seller but I still don't have my refund back yet."
"I've had a z3compact and my only complain is that I kinda like the design of the z3c better than this matte finish and kinda bulky z5c.other than that, fingerprint scanner is really responsive.. works about 80% of the time. battery life feels a bit shorter than my z3c but still manages to go for atleast a day and a half."
"When I first held this phone, I had the sudden urge to hum the James Bond theme.The Z5 Compact exudes class. There is no other way to put it. It's hands-down the most premium feeling phone I've held - and that's with it swinging against the big guns such as the S6 Edge, HTC One, and iPhone 6.Cons:-I'm not a huge fan of the frosted back, and think it would have looked better with a normal glass back or just a continuation of the excellent plastic used for the sides. This is largely personal preference though.-The volume rocker is in an extremely awkward position. Unlike the Z3 Compact, you really have to work to use it. Would have been better located above the power button.-It comes in Japanese, and it's very difficult to find the language setting. Pull down the notification bar, then again for settings, click the gear, scroll down to the keyboard, then the top setting.Pros:-The fingerprint sensor/power button is fantastic. It's placed perfectly, works fast, and has just the right feel.-Impeccable fit and finish.-Near stock android.-Design.-Specs.-Camera button, which is sadly a dying feature. The quick-launch ability alone makes it worth having."
"There really isn't anything like it available for purchase at this time. This phone is exactly what the iPhone users are hanging onto, a sub 5 inch phone with competitive specs. The 720p resolution is totally fine for the size of the screen. If you feel like it is a big sacrifice, just remember it improves the battery life (up to 2 days). The camera is pretty amazing and the expandable memory (micro sd) is also a breath of fresh air coming from an iPhone. If you want the freedom of Android and a reasonably priced phone (unlike the iPhone), then do not hesitate, BUY IT!"
"This phone is exactly what I've been looking for. I have small hands and would like it if it were even smaller, but I can't complain since it's pretty small compared to all the phones available now. I have att and it works great. The screen looks great, it's snappy, and I even like that it's not so thin. Really thin phones are hard to hold and even cramp my hands sometimes. Battery life is about average. Fingerprint sensor works great. Although battery isn't removable, SD and Sim cards are. I really wish Sony success because I'd hate to see this line of phones go away."
"The phone is amazing, however, a very crucial part to using this phone was missing when it arrived. In order to use a sim card in this phone you need a little piece of plastic which holds the sim card and acts as a tray that you slide into the sim card slot. this ""sim card tray"" was missing from my phone. I contacted the seller about this and they told me the phone does not come with a sim card tray. The sim card tray is mentioned in the paperwork and I even found several listings to buy them individually online. I had to purchase one separately because the seller was of no help and was completely oblivious of this part's existence."
Phone has screen problem making it almost unusable... No warranty and $400+ down the drain. Very very unhappy.
Works as advertised.I wanted a phone that fit in my hands and pocket as a small person.Being able to text with one hand is a plus for me too.
"The phone has been working well so far, but I was disappointed by the thickness which is higher than my previous phone."
Great little phone
"This is awesome deal. Personally I like a compact device. In compact class, this is one of the best smartphone that I ever."
I love my Sony Xperia z5 compact!! It's comparable in size to the iPhone 5c just right for me and having an amazing sound and picture quality is a huge bonus!!!!
Not recommended to water
"This thing gets hot. I have a smart watch and due to some ultra sensitive touch screen it turns on in my pocket a lot. So two day battery life is totally a joke, Im lucky if i get a full day. I really love this phone and the camera is great but the battery is not as great as they say. side note the fingerprint scanner is about 80% accurate."
"Initially everything went well, however, the phone stopped charging in less than 7 months after purchasing from seller. The phone is defective as it should work longer than seven months. I would not recommend seller or phone products given my experience with both seller and/or their products.."
"Excellent device, no other words to describe it. Don't think too much, just get it!"
Pros: Looks Size Camera Battery Life Screen quality (PPI) Screen to bezel ratio Front facing speakers Charging speed Multi-color LED notification light User interface Customizable Fingerprint scanner Dedicated camera button Clicky buttons Build qualtiy Water and dust proof Fast and responsive Micro SD card expandable storageCons: Doesn't work with Verizon
"Absolutely love this phone - battery life isn't as long as my Z3C, but I have 1-2 days out of it regularly.Supports QC 2.0, which is pretty awesome. I like the refined waterproofing design.This phone doesn't seem to jump/slide off everything like my Z3C - but I used the Ringke Fusion case for it anyway.The fingerprint unlock is an excellent feature - can be a little problematic, but usually gets it right on the 2nd/3rd try.I have a 200Gb Sandisk MicroSD installed - just about the right amount for Music/Pictures/Maps."
"Faulty product. Wifi failed to work, returned immediately."
My cousin loved it
"This is a fantastic phone.Sony did an excellent job with the user environment. It's only a little customised from stock Android and isn't always trying to sell you stuff like a Samsung device. The bloatware isn't too bad either and can be disabled. Sony includes a free service to locate, lock, or wipe your lost phone. Also software to copy over your old data. Very useful.Battery life really is good. My first day, it lasted until night which is quite good doing all of the setup and playing around. Under normal usage I have about 40% left at the end of the day--Wow! STAMINA mode seems really usable too for special times when you need extra battery life.The phone is small and very portable. It's not wafer thin, probably because of a larger battery. I don't find the thickness to be too much. Of course, with the smaller size you get a smaller screen. Is it worth the trade-off? Only you can decide.Performance is fast and flawless, which is unparalleled in a small phone. It doesn't seem to get particularly hot.The screen looks beautiful and the pixel density is plenty.I love the fingerprint sensor! Works great and so conveniently located. It's a shame they couldn't include this feature on the US model. I had Android encrypt the device for security, no problems.Volume control buttons seemed oddly placed at first, but they are out of the way and how often do you use them? Not that much.Camera, although it could be improved, is very usable as a compact camera. Dedicated camera button is very nice. Picture quality good, shutter delay fair.Water and dust sealing should be on EVERY phone. Great how it doesn't have fiddly flaps to cover all the ports.Audio quality is excellent and seems better than my old Samsung phone.No US warranty is unfortunate. If it breaks, I plan to pay for any repairs. I can live with the risk as a trade-off for the fingerprint scanner.Earbuds were included; thank you, Sony.Included charger had the international prong setup and included adapter for US outlets. Works fine, I have other chargers that work just as fine. Sometime I'll probably pick up a Quick Charge 2.0 charger.Overall, a super package! I'm so happy with it."
"Although the specs are good on paper, software bugs stop this phone from performing the simplest of tasks correctly.Hardware and build wise this thing is great. Button layout is perfect for one hand use. Bezel space is small, front stereo speakers are cool.Software wise... This phone is a joke. I had low expectations going in but was surprised at how bad it really is. The camera sucks, theres no way to say it's good at anything. Stereo speakers on front aren't same volume so it's a rather odd sound when viewing videos. Luminosity of auto brightness is all over the place, all of the time. And then there's overheating. The 810 in here should have been called dragons breath because it leaves the phone inoperable at times. I haven't shot 4k video or even played games yet and it gets above 170 just browsing the web. Charging the phone gets it to about 140 also.. and if you get a phone call or have to actually touch the phone, you get burned.All in all,if you're not a heavy user or you are coming from an iPhone, you'll probably like it. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."
display flickers! great cell phone with a great cam and functionality but the screen issue is a major problem that happened 1 month after purchase. I don't recommend to buy this cell.it looks a bit like this [...]
"The phone is compact and responsive but two real issues that are really bothersome:1. In the middle of a phone call, there is a 10 to 15 second pause when I hear a noise and the other party can't hear me. It corrects itself but does the same thing again after a minute or two on the call. I need to disconnect and call numerous times on a long call.2. The camera is nothing great. My old Samsung S4 has a better camera, especially in low light conditions. This takes very grainy pictures.Terrible experience. Very disappointed with Sony."
"The phone is doing great so far.Like the design and this size is perfect for me.I have used Z3 compact before, and Z5 compact runs faster.Definite a good choice if you want to have a smaller smart phone."
"This phone is exactly what I was looking for. More compact so I can actually hold and utilize it with one hand, still water proof for random spills and drops in the pool, and great photos!I had a little trouble at first because I forgot all of the little things one must do to get a network unbranded phone to work. Also, if you don't remove the plastic screen protector that comes on it in the box, it will disrupt your ear proximity sensor.Some things you'll have to check if you want full functionality of your phone will be your SMS service center number, APN access point network for Internet and Lte to work, network settings in general. All of this info is available online, so don't be deterred. It's very easy to just type in a couple of numbers and enjoy your new phone."

"Everything good with this buddy, although it crashes sometimes with snapchat and sometimes you wish the battery last longer (cause it should since it is 2600mAh) but its all what it says to be, so, we are good."
"This started out as an amazing device. Unfortunately, it did not end well. I am not going to list how amazing the phone is or the pros, the hardware specs already do. The problems with this phone are that it started to slow down over time because it began overheating. It becomes unresponsive and then apps crash. A separate issue is when it randomly reboots. This is unrelated to overheating. I honestly really like the device, but what's practical about an overheating supercar? Nothing. I remove 3 stars for overheating, software issues, and because they were severe enough that I had to return the device."
soooooooo ggggggoooooooooddddddd phone
"Excellent phone , the only one with a small screen (fits smaller hands) and a killer hardware/software combination. The camera is really good and the screen is super sharp. Truly excellent engineering work. My wife had iPhone 5s and a huawei p8 and this is beating them on the first round"
I am a fellow Sony Xperia z3 compact moving up to the z5 compact. Definitely a better phone. The LCD screen is definitely an improvement. The speakers are definitely louder. Fingerprint sensor works perfect. The 32 gigabytes of internal memory is also a plus due to all the apps that are out there that you may want or need. Camera definitely takes better pictures but I would not say it's a faster speed to take the picture
"A very well-designed and compact phone. I migrated to this from an HTC M8 one and I love that I can put the phone in my pocket now and not feel like it's awkward to sit or bend at the hip. It also feels speedier and is easy to hold: no slick, curved, and stylish-yet-impractical backplate here."
awesome!!!!
Very good
"Firstly, I don't often review products, and even less often am I this satisfied with a smartphone. As a consumer, I'm incredibly attentive to the small details in a product, and if the issue is annoying enough, I'll return it. Not so with the Xperia Z5 Compact (Z5c from here on). In more detail below:DISPLAY:Stunning LCD with virtually no light bleed. Colors are well saturated, and almost approach AMOLED in the level of depth. Whites are accurate, and text overall is sharp. I prefer AMOLED for the true blacks, but this is a very solid LCD. If I had one complaint, it's that the circuitry is sometimes visible in bright light behind the display.DESIGN:The phone fits in the hand very well. The sides are very easy to grip on to, and the frosted finish on the back glass is a huge improvement over the previous Xperia devices. The fingerprint scanner on the power button is extremely accurate and fast. I would have placed the volume button a bit higher than Sony did, however. I haven't tested the waterproofing, but it's a useful feature to have.PERFORMANCE:I was concerned at first about the Snapdragon 810 in the device, and heat issues, but so far, I haven't felt any extreme heating. It does definitely get warm during use, but no more than say, a Samsung Galaxy S6. It's very fast, and for gaming, the 720p display serves it well. Some users have reported performance issues or lagging through the UI, particularly when an SD card is inserted, though I've not noticed any of these. I also have had no issues with streaming Bluetooth audio.BATTERY:I don't think this device will last 2 days on a single charge, though it absolutely can get through a single day's use. I spend roughly half of my day in a low signal area, which I expect would affect this, and thus, lower the battery life. In a stronger signal environment, it would probably last longer.CAMERA:The camera is excellent. The photos are crisp, and sharp on most subjects. Low-light performance could be better, but I have no real complaints with the camera.MISC:It doesn't support Wi-Fi calling, or VoLTE on T-Mobile, though I doubt this can be helped, considering it's an international model.Overall, this is the best option if you're looking for a compact Android device. I'm certainly keeping it."
Good
"I bought this phone as a replacement for my Z1 which I had for over two and half years. I had zero issues with it until I shattered the screen. The Xperia line of phones are touted as being waterproof or at least they were initially. Sony seems to have shied away from that position now and for good reason. You see, I originally bought the Z1 for three main reasons: the 20mp camera, water resistance, build quality. My experience with the Z1 lead me to believe that the Z5c would be a suitable replacement. I assumed that the Z5c would certainly exceed the standards set by the Z1. I was wrong.Firstly, the positives1) The camera of the Z5c does outperform the Z1's especially in low light conditions. The overall picture quality is only slightly better, however.2) The UI is smoother and faster, likely due to the more powerful CPU3) Slightly better battery life4) Twice the storage capacity5) No flap cover for the USB slot6) Louder speakersThe negatives1) Plastic frame. The phone feels cheap compared to the Z1. It also is less damage resistant than the metal Z12) Frosted glass back plate. While it looks nice, it makes the phone slick and therefore harder to hold3) Build quality and water resistanceI assumed that the Z5c would be even more watertight than the Z1 since it has a higher IP certification. Nope. Even though I swam with my Z1 dozens of times, occasionally exceeding its depth rating, I never once had any issues. I would even wash it in the sink weekly. The phone was waterproof until I broke the screen. The Z5c, on the other hand, died the very moment it touched water. It was thoroughly waterlogged as if it lacked a water resistant seal entirely.Sony's repair service only made matters worse. They claimed that my Z5c was made for the Polish market (what?) and that there are no repair centers in the US. I was given an address in England to ship it and they said they would pay for Royal Mail shipping. Naturally, they could not seeing as how there are no Royal Mail offices in the US. Despite paying for shipping, Sony fixed the phone free of charge since it was under warranty. The turn around time was a bit over a month. I believe I got lucky as I have read that Sony will not honor warranty claims that are the result of water damage.So I go to turn the phone on and all seems well. At this point, I'm just glad to finally have my phone back. However, to my dismay the volume key does not work. They replaced the screen along with many internal components and performed a diagnostics test and yet somehow the broken volume key passed the test. What the heck. Every Xperia phone lets you run a simple pass/fail diagnostic test in the settings menu. One of the tests is for the volume rocker key. I don't understand how they missed this.I reached out to Sony again who said to ship the phone to them. And so I did. Over three weeks went by before I asked them for a status update. They told me they did not receive my phone. Strange. USPS stated that it passed customs and marked it as delivered. A couple more weeks go by before I receive an international package at my door. I thought maybe they had fixed my phone without notifying me. A foolish thought. What happened was that the Sony Service Center refused to take possession of the package so it was returned to me. Apparently there was a customs fee that they would not pay, despite stating that they would pay for shipping both ways. Since I paid for shipping to them both times they could have at least paid the measly fee. Why would Sony pays for it the first time but not the second? I asked USPS if I could pay the fee upfront and I was told I cannot.I've had it with Sony. Clearly the quality of their phones isn't what it used to be, not to mention the quality of their customer service. I'll update this review if Sony rectifies the situation. Don't hold your breath though."
"Phone is awesome. Finall, now I own a phone with speakers to the front lol Only wished it had come with some headphones. Everything these days are more expensive and coming with less. Atleast I got the charger :-)"
"Bought a Sony Xperia Compact white in January. After a month of use, the screen started giving trouble, now I cannot use it. I replaced the screen, formatted the phone, and nothing works. Also, since it does not come with warranty, I had to cover the costs myself. All in all, I could have gotten a Samsung S7 Edge for all my money. Please do not buy the compact White models, they have been faulty."
Excellent smartphone
The phone is great. Thanks
"Great all-around android device; love the size & shape. Fits well into any pocket, including women's jeans! (This was a problem for me with larger phones.) Fingerprint scanner is a great feature and the camera is great; I haven't tested how waterproof it is yet, but it's nice to not worry about it in rain etc. Software all runs smoothly and I have yet to come up on anything the phone struggles to do.Rated down by 1 star as it tends to heat up and drain battery relatively quickly, though. It's excellent in 60º (F) weather where the air temp naturally compensates, but as it gets up to 80s or 90s the battery just burns up if you're using the screen a lot."
"OK I didn't wanna post any review within a few days of my possession to avoid looking like snap judgment. So I had this phone for about a month now and I gotta say I'm very pleased with it. The display is so beautiful and the clarity is high. Even on low brightness. I thought the screen might be too small for me but it's perfect. I have small hands myself. Now I don't have to stretch my thumb across the screen to text messages. I can text comfortably with one hand. The battery life is just AWESOME!!!! Coming from a MOTO X that could barely last one day, I was afraid the battery life won't be as good for this phone. And I was so wrong. I can easily use this device for two and half days straight without charging it. That includes internet browsing, data using, video and music usage, picture taking and basic calling/texting. Remember still turn off your phone once awhile, it's like a computer, it needs to rest sometime. Anyhow, the only thing that is not too great about this phone is the camera. Don't get me wrong. It takes great and clear pictures. I like the feature that you can choose what to focus when there are multiple things in one frame. The shutter speed sucks. It takes a few seconds for a photo to take a photo. That was pretty disappointing. I did insert a SD card later on and it did help with the speed a little but not too much. But out of all the good things about this phone, I can let one slide. Nothing is perfect right?"
"Purchased on February, now reviewing during August.The Sony Z5 Compact is a great little device with plenty of powerful features.Specs:2GB ramQualcomm Snapdragon 81023 MP Back Camera (wow!)5 MP Front CameraMicro USB Charging Port4.6 inch Touch Screen DisplayIP 68 Waterproof, Dust proof, etc.Micro SD and Nano SIm card slotsReview:Wow!, I'm surprised Sony was able to compact their larger Z5 into such a small body that is convenient for your pocket and your hand. It is truly some remarkable engineering. Well, that compact size does have a drawback that may put some people off which is that it is a blocky/bulky phone. Even though it is a blocky/bulky phone, I always managed to get a nice firm grip because of the size and bulk of the phone. The screen size is perfect in my opinion for the size of this phone which is the same screen size for the iPhone 6/6s. The phone is also waterproof and dustproof which was sort of a minor, yet surprising, thing that Sony would usually put on their phones that is beginning to be used by other phone companies such as Samsung. The Camera packs 23 MP which is quite surprising for the size of the phone. The camera takes good pictures and good videos, HOWEVER, in only good lighting. If you take pictures in the dark, It will appear murky and pixelated. The phone's software experience has been vastly improved from its early beginnings and has lost almost all of its setbacks it had when it started. Sony's android skin is fast and simple, offering a near stock Android Marshmallow experience. The Speakers produce good sound but are located in the most convenient location that most phone companies ignore. The speakers are located in the front with one on top near the camera and one on the bottom. This means you don't cover the speakers when ever you're watching a video in landscape. Most companies put the speakers at the bottom of the phone next to the Micro USB charging port. The biggest grip of the phone is the processor that is encased in it which is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810. This CPU has a well known record of producing more heat than most of other CPUs in the market. This CPU is very powerful and still relevant even with Qualcomm's new CPU the Snapdragon 820, but it just gets hot very quickly. The heat isn't hot to the touch where it is unbearable it just gets warm when gaming, browsing the web, watching videos, etc. The battery life on this phone is great and it usually has enough charge to last me for a whole day and some the day afterwards. This is, However, if you utilize Sony's STAMINA Battery saver feature. You can still get a whole days worth without it, but you will probably have to cut back on CPU intensive tasks. Overall, this phone offers the strength and speed of its older counterpart(Z5) in a neat little package that doesn't make it uncomfortable in the pocket.Pros:Speed and power( CPU).Small and convenient package.Great front and back cameras.Great battery life.Speaker location is very good and sound great.Waterproof.Cons:CPU gets warm very quicklyCamera quality isn't very good in low light conditions.The thickness of the phone may put off some people.Will Update if necessary."
The headphone jack has started malfuctioning within 3 months of use.
Excellent phone! Had the Samsung Galaxy it is over rated. Sony has done an amazing job. Top quality
I like the phoneHowever it arrived in a soaking wet box. Completely not even a box anymore. Good thing the phone was waterproof and I know how to read a manual online.
First week and im enjoying this thing! Has nice speakers and perfect camera for a compact phone. This is a complete package.
"It's small, it's functional, an elegant black rectangle"
"First, I want to warn you that I have always loved Sony phones since it was Sony Ericsson. I still remember one of my older phones was a Sony Ericsson K550 that had a 2MP camera but produced pictures with the highest quality. After a disappointment with a Sony Ericsson C901 I decided to switch to Nokia from 2009 until 2013 when I bought a Sony Xperia GO that worked perfectly for 27 months until this November.I decided to buy a Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and after one week I think I can share my experience with all of you.This is a good phone. I know some people would never even consider getting a Sony phone but even they admit Sony is just quality. This phone has an excellent hardware and the way it integrated with the software (Lollipop working perfectly) is what I would call excellence. Connectivity is good since I can connect to 4G (LTE) without any trouble but you need to make sure this phone supports your carrier’s LTE band.Call quality (Let’s remember we still make phone calls with smartphones) is good and I have not had any issues with reception at all. The phone is thick but not as extremely thick as some people have complained. It’s noticeable in your pocket but nothing gross. It’s not heavy or uncomfortable. I have to mention at this point that inserting the SIM card and the memory card is not easy. I swear I’ll never open those slots again. I inserted a 64GB memory card and it’s working flawlessly.The screen delivers beautiful colors and the resolution is excellent. I know some people have complained it could have been better but still is very good. One of the main reasons I love Sony Xperias is because they usually have anti-scratch protection and I witnessed it with my previous Sony Xperia Go as it never got a single scratch in 27 months. The camera has been controversial in some reviews. Look, I know we should believe that smartphones will replace digital cameras but guess what? I don’t think so. The camera takes very good pictures and delivers excellent videos but it’s true it is not perfect. However, the camera is good for most occasions.Sound quality is excellent. I used PowerAMP for my music and this phone has a special feature to improve the overall sound quality with headsets (DSEE HX). It works perfectly and I haven’t had to arrange and tweak the PowerAMP equalizer all over as I did with my previous Sony Xperia GO.Battery life is good but not as other smartphones. If you listen to a lot of music (like me) you’ll need to charge the phone every single day. This is not a problem for me but I know some people might not like it. However, I have to mention that one day I almost didn’t use it and it just discharged from 99% at 7AM to 90% at 7PM so it really depends on usage. Another advantage is that it charges very quickly.The phone is very responsive and I have not experienced any bugs or lags as someone reported before. The camera works pretty well when I click on it taking just one second for the app to open.At this point you must be asking why I’m giving it only 4 stars and I am going to tell you why: heat.Unfortunately, the phone does get warm when you update apps or run another “intensive” process. It’s not all the time so I think Sony has done something maybe not to fix the problem they had before but at least to alleviate it. I want to clarify it gets warm – nothing extreme but still noticeable.This is an excellent phone, really. It’s quality and performance all in one but the heating issue should have been fixed by Sony at this point."
Used to be a z3 compact user.z5 compact is better than z3c.
"Out of the box, the phone was in Chinese and it took a while to get the setting correct. The phone also did not work perfectly after popping in the sim card. I used the phone on AT&T and to activate data on AT&T I had to setup the APN. The instructions are available on AT&T's website.The fingerprint sensor is a good feature; However, I also using an iOS base iPhone 6, and I find too few apps on android fully utilization the feature and I find myself falling back to my iOS device its integration into the apps.Dedicated camera feature is amazing and the new layout of the micro usb is excellent. It feels much more well built than the z3 compact. Speeds are good w/few hiccups."
Took a while but excelent product
good
Awesome piece of kit
"Great phone, I was worried about the phone getting warm, so far no probelm at all (stays cool almost all the time- switching from Iphone).this Compact phone is waterprrof, has an octacore processor...best phone in the market...works great on Tmobile."
"This phone is a hard-to-find size unless you decide to join the dark side and buy Apple. I was looking for a multi function (smart) phone not a tablet that also has a phone. For me, bigger is not better. The phone is fast, has enough storage for most people and also that storage can be expanded by up to 100Gb via SD card. After reading the write-ups, I decided that this was the right one. I then had to decide which model, US or International and which vendor. I chose the international model, E5823 because it was a tad lower price but more importantly has the fingerprint reader (left off of the E5803, US model). There were two other criteria - would Sony honor the warranty in the US? Answer from Sony, yes. It may take a couple more days to process, but no warranty issue. Their service center is in Laredo Texas. Also, I wanted to know where I might have to return the phone if it arrived DOA (it didn't). Some vendors require shipping back to Europe or Hong Kong at a cost of $50-$60. No way on that. I chose to buy from CANGURO through Amazon. They are in Chicago and back the product from there. They answered all of my questions. EXCELLENT seller! There is one issue with the phone and it's a software issue. It was not enough for me to downgrade the rating, but might be an issue for you. After upgrading to Android 6.0, Marshmallow, the FM radio freezes after 15-20 minutes. It sometimes requires re-booting the phone to exit the app. Sony has promised a fix."
Great phone... Arriving at time.
"I bought this phone to replace my Z3 Compact.It's an improved version, so it excels the previous one, but has a major bug. The phone randomly shuts down once or twice every day! Just from nothing, freezes and restarts. Quite annoying, it takes ~2 minutes... I ve tried what the support team said i should do, but didn't fix the issue. As i bought it without warranty im sticking with a brand new useless phone. Also, this happened to A LOT of people."
"great smartphone, excelent service"
"Not very serious with the time delivery, the device it's ok to use in Mex. with Telcel and US with T-mobile"
awesome
"Great phone, feels a bit thicker than my Z1 though."
"Overall, this has been a great device. The camera is very laggy, but it seems to be a software issue that Sony is aware of. Hopefully they fix it. Otherwise, solid phone!"
"Long story short: this is the phone that finally convinced me to make the jump from Apple's iOS. I had been considering making the jump for some time, but I had yet to find an Android phone that matched the build quality and performance of my iPhone 6S. The z5 Compact finally did convinced me.Pros:+ Same size screen as the iPhone 6S, despite being smaller and lighter.+ Excellent build quality - the phone feels premium, solid and well made. I don't worry about anything breaking if I drop it once or twice.+ Waterproof!+ Very little manufacturer bloatware, especially compared to Samsung or LG. Among other things, this means that future Android updates will hit this phone sooner than many other Android devices.+ I actually most of the bloatware that's included. Sony's launcher is fast and responsive - I'm actually using it instead of the official Google launcher.+ Camera is high quality.+ Better battery life than my iPhone 6s+ Fingerprint scanner+ Plenty of processing power - I haven't yet seen the phone slow down or choke on any app I've thrown at it.Cons:- Cases options for this phone in the U.S. are limited when compared to the dancing plethora of iPhone cases that flood every electronics store, website, gas station and grocery store.- Because this is the international version of the phone, there's no warranty- Because this is the international version of the phone, some apps think I'm in Ireland. I'm sure a simple setting could easily change this, but I haven't yet found it.- Fingerprint scanner doesn't work as well as iPhone 6S (though it's still good). I think this is mainly due to the fact that the scanner is smaller than the iPhone scanner, so it has less to work with.Overall, I've found this phone to be the perfect fit for me. It really hits the sweet spot of combining the power, battery life, screen size and non-bloated OS that I've been looking for."
"The phone is good, stable, small. But when my phone cracked, Sony was really competing with five-ply-a$$wipe on the scale of efficient and successful support. Seriously. If you ever expect that you'll need to call Sony to fix something that might have gone wrong, just get a different device and don't look back."
"I've had it two months now and it freezes constantly, heats up really hot every single time I use it, even for a few minutes. It also shuts down apps all the time randomly. The battery is suddenly horrible, it drops 10% everytime I use it so it's dead halfway through the day, then it won't charge, and when you finally get it to charge it will charge all night and still not be at 100. I even deleted everything off my phone to make it run better but it did not change anything. Worst phone I've ever had. Don't waste your money."
It is so beautiful a phone with great camera.
great
"the phone is awesome i like it very much and beside the fact that it fit in y pocket, it`s fast and full of surprises the camera is wonderful it is the phone i was looking for."
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTno doubt innovative design and power but it suffers from two major flaws:1) very very buggy software, Sony mobile did a crappy job implementing the Android platform for this device - camera app crashes all the time, and the it looks like the software is not using the hardware properly and ultimately providing sub optimal performance for a device of this class, especially the camera lag and results quality despite the high specs.2) Heat - when i bought this phone i read many reviews saying that the snapdragon 810 inside is hotter but it only noticeable when capturing a 4K video ( which i wouldn't care less about ) . the truth is that the device is always hot, even on standby, even what doing simple operations like texting and browsing through some pictures. the battery seemed to drain relatively quickly. reading from other reviews it looks like Sony has a serious problem with their QA. what a shame from a technology giant such Sony to ship such a beta product.better go with GX S6 edge which is lighter, more powerful and more assurance about the quality and updates the device will receive along the way."
"I'm still getting used to it but I have to say, it is a very nice device."
"My previous phone was Xperia Z1 and I really loved it so I decided to stick with the brand. I would say that the experience with Z5 is fairly similar - everything is fast and smooth, the camera is nice. This phone apparently came from Hong Kong (or something like this). I had to look at my old phone to figure out how to change the language. In the beginning I was afraid that things won't work properly, but everything has been fine so far (after 2 months of use)"
"Worst cellphone I have ever used. It looked cute and worked fine for the first three weeks. And all kinds of problem shows up. After I upgraded the system, I can't access to my cellular data. I found the instruction online and fixed that manually. I can't use my group message at all.Apparently SONY never realized that normal people will group text each other. My music app starts to play by itself out of blue, which gave me couple of embarrassing moments during meetings.Then the screen cracked. Well, that was my fault. I fixed that by spending 170 dollars more on this stupid phone. And then the front camera is broken. Just to make a double down, my text function starts to fail. My screen turned completely black when I am making a phone call.I don't think SONY is even trying to sell their cellphones. I bought it because it's cute. But I can't even use it as a simple cellphone. NEVER ever ever buy this phone."
Ok
"I love this phone, I was a little worried about the overheating reports but phone run cool even after 20 min of FHD recording on my last beach day."
"Great phone, everything you need in small size. Just like I want.But when I received it, the box wasn't sealed, but still new.Thx"
"I agree with most of the other reviews that state that this is a great reasonably sized phone. Since they already detail the good parts, I'll spare you the extra words.That said, its battery life, size, and camera quality are marred by mediocre Bluetooth performance, camera app unresponsiveness, and poor stability.I've noticed Bluetooth audio with aptX can stutter. While it only happens twice in the included demo video (at 0:44 and 1:10), it can happen rather frequently if there's a lot going on in the background. It's very distracting whenever it happens. I strongly believe that the issue lies with the Z5C's aptX codec:* The headphones in question are the Plantronics BackBeat PRO Wireless Noise Canceling Hi-Fi Headphones with Mic - Compatible with iPhone, iPad, Android, and Other Smart Devices. In my testing, they work fine on the Nexus 4 and OnePlus One (Android phones that *don't* support aptX), and on an iPad and MacBook Pro (Apple devices that *do* support aptX).* Additionally, all of the non-aptX receivers I've tried with this phone work fine. As of this writing, this includes the Amazon Echo, Honda CR-V HandsFreeLink, JayBird BBX1MB BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Black (Discontinued by Manufacturer), and the HomeSpot NFC-Enabled Bluetooth Audio Receiver for Sound System.Despite the inclusion of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 in the phone, it's not very responsive. While taking a video, the camera app appears to stutter and drop a few frames every few seconds. It can be very difficult to stop taking a video - the phone will appear to still be capturing frames, but pressing the stop button can occasionally do nothing. Once the phone is in this state, nothing on the screen will respond including the back, home, and task switcher buttons (even though the camera still updates as you move the phone around). The only way out is to hard reboot (which can take up to three minutes if you have device encryption enabled). If you close the camera using the home button or the task switcher, the rest of the phone becomes very slow until you reopen the camera and close it using the back button.As for stability, I'll just leave the text of my initial 1-star review here:After successfully using this phone for navigation, I put it back in my pocket. When I took it out an hour later, it wouldn't turn back on. I could tell it wasn't a suddenly dead battery because the phone vibrated whenever I put my finger on the fingerprint sensor. I tried a hard reboot by removing and replacing the SIM card and the phone has been unresponsive since then.This is a real shame especially because there are no other decent phones on the market at this form factor (except maybe the Z3 Compact, which I've seen run into the exact same problem).Eventually I figured out that the problem was because Android crashed pretty hard since pressing and holding the ""OFF"" button hidden behind the SIM/SD cover brought the phone back to a working state."
"I got to say after 5 days of use, I absolutely love this phone. The small compact size is perfect for me and I don't mind the thickness, I assume it's thicker than most to put that bigger battery in. I thought it would be hard to go small since I'm coming from the iPhone 6 Plus, but wasn't bad at all in my opinion. This is actually the first android phone that I can say I won't be going back to my iPhone. I get about 1 1/2 days of battery life at moderate use. so far my screen on time averages 4 hours, best was 4 hours 45 minutes. My last android phone was the 2015 moto x pure and that battery life was horrible along with others I have owned, nexus 5x, Htc one m7, m8, m9, nexus 5, and so on which always made me go back to my iPhone along with other reasons. I am in the United States and with At&t and can confirm LTE works perfectly. No issues at all. Also I didn't have to manually put in the APN for mms or Internet to work, u just make sure u have wifi connected and then go to settings, then more, then scroll down and hit internet settings. Hit download and it will automatically download the correct settings for your carrier, make sure your carrier sim is installed. The camera is good enough for me, I'm no professional photographer so I just leave it in superior auto mode and it takes good pics in my opinion. I can confirm the phone back does get a little warm during some situations. First one was downloading all my apps from the play store at the same time. 2nd is using hangouts for video calls, other than that it has been fine. The heat it did get did not burn my hand and was still comfortable to hold and use. I did get the DP glass screen protector which I put on all my phones and I like it. I'm not a case kind of guy so waiting on my dbrand skin. I did get the white version and I have not had any screen issues or my on screen buttons not working on my bed. I assume others just got a defective unit. I got usb cord, earbuds, and a international plug in the box. Just a side not I only have one hand and am super happy that a company actually makes a one handed device with great specs. Most android phones I've had one handed use was very difficult if not impossible but had no choice if wanted top specs, so thank you Sony for high end specs in a compact size."
"One week after used it the phone start acting up, the screen frozen and intermittently lost signal.Not only that, the phone easily to get hot, I see many people has the same issues. I guess the phone it self has hardware problem. I return it back"
No problems yet at all. Met all expectations.
The screen does like crazy things on its own without user touching the screen hate product.
"Well done Sony, the phone is better than expected and I like the compact size, as I find the rest of the models too big for phones and not big enough for tablets ! ;)"
"Very bad GPS, and generally very unreliable... not expected of this ""high end"" expensive product."
"Okay, for those who encounter Bluetooth audio stuttering and choppy sound:after you connect your Bluetooth device, go to Setting -> App -> Running App -> terminate two services: sony screen mirroring and throw...this is a temporary and effective solution that I found with no root access required.I am wondering if Sony software engineers tested their software... Do they only listen music through wired headphone??sigh... their device is so great, but the software is so badly designed.. :(It could be alot better by just using stock android..."
"I really like it. It doesnt run hot, little warm,, but not hot at all. Great battery life and customization. Getting 5-6 SOT. Most all games run with no issues and good fps."
"EDIT (1/9/16): My original evaluation of this phone remains the same but I would encourage people to look at the HTC One A9 as it addresses the US compatability aspect while still being pocketable. It is not as compact as the Z5c, meaning Sony is still the only name in the game but the A9 is still manageable. You can read my review here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B017D554UKI have been through every phone you can imagine and the Sony Xperia Compact line continues to impress me. I recently had a Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x and the sizes are just to much for me. Yes, I really want Marshmallow but can wait an extra few weeks for it. I asked a few questions before buying and had trouble getting clear information due to the technical nature, but wanted to clarify for those who are looking.This phone is almost fully compatible with T-Mobile USA and I can confirm Band 12 (Extended Range LTE) *does* work (confirmed with LTE Discovery). However, there is no HD Voice, VoLTE or WiFi Calling. For me, these trade-offs were well worth it because of the phenomenal battery life (which will likely get better on Marshmallow), the compact form factor and water resistance (just nice to have as a backup). If WiFi calling is an issue for you, you can use something like Hangouts phone calls as a backup. It is of course not as convenient, but it works. HD Voice is only compatible T-Mobile <> T-Mobile and, yes, you can tell the difference and I wish I had it - but again, not a huge trade-off. VoLTE is the one that gets me. For those of you that don't know, this means the phone drops your data down to 3G/HSPA when making a phone call. Not the end of the world but you may notice the difference when navigating, tethering to your PC, trying to navigate, etc. Again, you could get around this by using a third-party dialer (Hangouts) since that is a VoIP call but for most people, this may be overkill. I suspect though most people buying this phone are pretty familiar with these things since the phone is not advertised in the US. The lack of VoLTE/WiFi Calling/HD Voice is the only reason I knocked off a star.Note the phone comes with an international charger and adapter. It is compatible with QuickCharge technology and charges rapidly for example with this Swiftrans 3221263 Quick Charge 2.0 36W Dual Ports USB Car ChargerThe camera on the phone is pretty good - not the best - but will be fine for 9/10 people.I am using the phone with Aomax® For Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini Tempered Glass Screen Protector [Superslim 0.26mm,2.5D Round Edge,9H Hardness] [Retail Package] For(Sony Xperia Z5 Compact / Mini) and Orzly® - FlexiSlim Case for SONY XPERIA Z5 COMPACT (2015 SmartPhone Model / Smallest Version / XPERIA Z5 MINI) - Super Slim (0.35mm) Protective Phone Cover in Semi Transparent WHITE. It was important to me I protected the device but didn't go overboard on the bulkiness - the combination of these two are perfect. I have reviewed each of these independently but included one picture here of the phone, glass and case together.Overall this is an awesome phone for people who aren't concerned about buying direct from a carrier and don't want a huge phone."
"This device heats up way too quickly and can get really hot. The fingerprint sensor is decent, although nothing compared to the accuracy and responsiveness of the nexus 5x sensor. I would've kept this phone if not for the thermal issues which is quite a defect in this phone."
"The phone looks great, I love the phone but no 4G or LTE on T-Mobile network. False advertising by the seller ( Mobile Front ) when they say "" Work GSM Network only Will NOT work with Sprint, Nextel, Verizon etc"" what is the point of buying LTE phone if it does not work!! . Note you will only get H+ on T-Mobile"
"An amazing phone! If you are in the US be prepared to run into small workable issues. I use AT&T and the company was great in supporting the unlocked phone, setting me up with a visit to the distribution office for the Nano-sim install and activation. The issues I am talking about is the distribution centers have no experience with this phone and had no idea how to move the data from my old Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) to the new phone, how to install the Nano Sim or the SD card. Since AT&T will not allow two phones to be active at the same time I could not download the Xperia App to the old phone --- you must do this prior to deactivating the old sim --- via Google play, a similar app is needed for Bluetooth transfer --- the only option to find and buy the Xperia data cable and try that. For those reading this and are thinking that all I have to do is to remove the SD card from the old Samsung Rugby which is also an Android device with all the latest updates. It doesn’t work, the Xperia Z5 compact rejected the phone contacts as not being in the right format. What the heck? The Samsung Rugby (smart phone version) does not use the *.vcf format and will not transfer to the Xperia.Even if I have to transfer all my contacts to my new Xperia Z5 Compact manually I’m willing to do so. This phone supports amazingly clear conversations using Bluetooth headset, speaker-phone, or near the face, the camera is outstanding. Even though there are complaints of the 780 display I don’t see it. I am very happy with a phone that is not tethered to a charging dock every few hours. I have to ask, if wireless means you are not connected to an RJ jack but are tethered to a charger all the time what is the difference? Bonus, with the reasonable screen size I do not have to hire a porter and baggage cart to haul it around, it fits into my pocket, imagine that!"
"I've always been an iPhone guy but Android phones have always intrigued me. I've had a lot of Android phones but none have really excited me all that much so I went back to Apple. I'm very happy with the Z 5 Compact and have finally found something to keep me away from my iPhone. This phone is built really well, looks sharp and is the perfect size.The phone is speedy, all wireless connections are sturdy and I love Sony's Android Skin."
"TL;DR PRO/CON list at bottom.I will start off this review by saying that I really wanted to love this phone. It does have some very good qualities about it. But the phone has its faults, which are enough for me to not give this phone a recommendation. I have used the phone for approximately 6 months.By background is that I worked in the cell phone industry selling phones for years, before moving into corporate IT and networking. I have been a amateur phone enthusiast and have easily had over 30 phones in my day. I also take exceptional care of my belongings, electronics getting special care. Seeing as this phone is a bit expensive for the size, it was a bit of a treat for myself as the specs and design looked like everything I wanted.HardwareScreen is a nice size for one handed use. Is very crisp and easy to see inside and outside in bright sunlight. Physical buttons are a tad awkward being so low on the device, but worked well for how I hold a phone. They provide enough click, but are a little hard to ""feel out"" and press during a call. Volume on the dual speakers is adequate for a small phone and produce decent sound. Sound through earphones is very good. 2 GB of RAM is more than enough to power the 720p screen and the 810 processor never lets up. The fingerprint scanner is top notch. Works very fast and recognizes fingers well. It allows 5 fingers to be registered. I did my wife's thumb, left index, right index, and my right thumb twice for better accuracy on my main digit. Sometimes I would pull the phone out of my pocket and it would already have registered my thumb and unlocked itself.UI, Performance, and Battery LifeThis phone came with Android Lollipop and is now updated to Marshmallow. The UI runs well. The fast processor and 2 GB of RAM don't let this phone slow down much if at all. Sony's take on Android is a very clean and minimal. Although there is plenty of Sony ""bloatware"" apps that come preinstalled and cannot be removed. You can ""disable"" them so they are no longer active and don't appear in the menu, but still live on the device. The Snapdragon 810 does still tend to get hot at random times. An app may be running in the background and you can feel the phone get much warmer. Never hot that you feel in danger, but warm enough to warranty a reboot in my opinion. Once back up the device was cool again. Battery life on the phone is decent, but not close to the expectation that Sony has set with previous devices in the series. It will get you through a day easily with moderate to heavy use, and can easily stretch to two days with light use. Recharge time however is very long. If you plug into a PC to charge expect at least 3 - 4 hours to charge it up. A quick charge adapter is a wise investment if you get this phone.Apps and GamingI largely got this phone for remote play on the PS4; that feature worked wonderfully with no issues. While the small screen was a little hard to see at times, I never had an issue with pairing the PS4 controller via bluetooth or playing over WiFi. The stock messaging app always gave me trouble with MMS messages, even with the correct settings from AT&T. I constantly got a you have an MMS to download message even though I already read the message. Textra fixed that issue and is a much better messaging app in my opinion. I don't really play any other types of mobile games, but companion apps for Destiny, Metal Gear Solid V, and standard apps like The Weather Channel all ran great on the device. As mentioned before there is A LOT of Sony branded items that are just flat out annoying and not needed.CameraWonderful camera. Loved to take pictures with this phone. They almost always come out clear and sharp. With the latest updates the camera opens quickly. The phone does a good job of fast auto-focus as promised. The shutter key on the side of the device is great for open the camera quickly and nice to take a picture. Finger placement while holding the phone is a bit awkward as the camera is very close the the top edge of the phone and gets covered easy if you are not careful. I spent most of my time in superior auto mode which produces 8 mp images. Going into manual will give you an overwhelming amount of options and allow full 23 mp pictures.DesignLooking at the phone it screams premium. Add waterproofing to the device and that is just piece of mind that some rain or accidental spills will not harm the device. No flap for the charge port is also wonderful as I've seen my share of them get damaged on phone such as the Galaxy S5 which kills the waterproofing of the device. The phone has a heafty weight to it that also feels good. The frosted glass back looks very nice and does not attract fingerprints. The phone is very slippery. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being course grit sand paper and 10 being metal coated in Teflon covered in olive oil, this phone is a 9 easy. The phone literally wants to slide out of your hand whenever you hold it. If nothing else a case is needed to provide some grip to the phone. Having a glass front and back also made me extra cautious and nervous about potential cracks. But I have always taken care of my devices and never cracked a screen.Phone callsPhone calls on the device were clean on my end every time. There were issues for the other caller especially when I used speaker phone. Callers would often complain that they heard themselves or that they could not hear me until I went back to the earpiece. It also appeared that using the speaker phone only used the bottom speaker and not both.DurabilityThis phone is by its very nature fragile. With over 90% of the outer casing being glass, you better believe this baby is delicate. The phone came with a pre-installed screen protector, but it became cruddy very fast. I normally don't use a screen protector and have never had an issue. I somehow managed to put a small scratch on the screen while it was in my pocket with NOTHING else in it one day while hiking. It was no big deal, as I couldn't see it when the screen was on, but I knew it was there and worried me that it got damaged so easily. Now just recently a friend placed my phone near a counter edge, and a got a few messages in a row that made the device vibrate right off the edge. Of course it landed face down on kitchen tile. Screen completely shattered and the touch screen stopped functioning altogether. I am not knocking this phone because of my stupid mistake, not many phones if any would survive a fall like that. Instead it just goes to show that a rugged case is just about required for this device. Which is a huge bummer since the phone looks so good.TL;DR and PROS/CONS ListPROS-- Nice screen for a smaller phone-- Beautiful design-- Great camera-- Fast performance-- Sony's UI has a good design-- Waterproof-- Native PS4 remote playCons-- Sony bloatware that cannot be removed, just disabled-- Slippery-- Fragile-- Poor speaker phone quality for the other caller-- Awkward button placement-- Very slow charge time-- Expensive-- Sony is slow to update UIConclusion and thoughtsThe phone is not worth the price. The camera is very nice and waterproofing is a big plus, but a few nice features do not outweigh the fact you are terrified to accidentally drop such an expensive phone. If you don't let anyone else touch this phone, and put it in a really hard-core case, it may last you a good while. If you live in the real world where you may leave you phone on a desk, give it to someone to take a picture of you, or bump into something with the phone in your pocket it may be dropped and will break."
Great phone. I replaced a Google nexus 5 with this. Wife already had the z3 compact. Easy decision.
DESIGN: greatPERFORMANCE: great.CAMERA: greatDISPLAY: mediocreFINGERPRINT SCANNER: unreliable
"great phone! fast, smoth, convenient size..."
"The phone is ok , the size and weight are nice BUTwhen you use it for more the few minutes feel SOOOO HOT that fact make me give 3 starsI think that hot is good for health and is a failure a big one"
I love this phone!
"Love this phone the camera is amazing the features is awesome, plus I get to play my ps4 on my phone"
"The best phone of the moment!!!! This little device is amazing!!! And no, its not a mini tablet, is a smartphone so the size is just perfect!"
"great phone and great style. It gets a tad warm when apps like snapchat are open for a long time. Other than that it's perfect, quick, and stylish."
Very good phone
"Love this phone. Just as good as the Z3 compact. Great battery life, perfect size, and love the waterproofness. No problems with overheating."
"I ordered this phone for my wife who was using an iPhone 4. The phone arrived in a few days (faster than expected). The box was sealed, so I was confident it was new as advertised. Out of the box it had 52% battery. I started the setup process and connected it to my home wifi network. The phone then told me it needed to perform a software upgrade. I said yes, and this process took about 15 minutes. I then took the phone to a nearby AT&T store to have them install a nano-SIM card. In 10 minutes this process was completed without any issues. It connected to the AT&T network in my home state of NY. So far, I'm very happy with this phone."
Overall good!
"I think it was mildly used, there were Chinese apps installed on it, a Chinese user logged on and the plastic on it was slightly pulled off.But it was in a good condition and nothing is wrong with it so far."
"The weight and size of this phone are ideal in my opinion. It is also very very fast, water resistant, very good battery life, looks very good, unreal 4k video(tested and impressed... pausing the video looks like a photo even on a large monitor), has a clear sharp display, great audio and a fantastic (for a phone) camera. I loved my Sony ZL phone, got it wet so then went to the Z1 which is great but too big and heavy for me. This is the best phone out there for my needs right now and I believe this size of phone will make a huge comeback as it is truly ideal, great job Sony! (PS I am on T-Mobile and I don't think I am getting LTE but still quite fast and battery drain is not an issue)"
"Looking for a small sized phone that packs a lot of power? Then this is for you. I may be in a minority but I just don't see the need for phones to be the size that they are right now. I wanted something small enough to operate with one hand and to easily fit in my pocket.My previous phone was an original Moto X and that was a great size for me so I wanted something similar, but all of the OEMs were only producing these massive devices that require two hands to operate. I mean really, how am I supposed to text and drive if I have to take both hands off the wheel? (That's a joke, NEVER text and drive.)So I did tons of research, using the phone comparison feature on sites like gsmarena.com to check the physical dimensions. The other problem was that when I did find a ""small"" phone, it usually had terrible specs. A dumbed down processor from 2 generations ago, not much memory, and often a mediocre camera.Then I found the Sony Xperia Z5 compact. This phone is small but it doesn't skimp on performance. It actually has the same processor as Google's flagship Nexus 6P, so it's blazing fast. Comes with 2GB ram (the 6P has 3GB though I believe) and 32GB built in storage which is easily expanded with an microSD card. Camera is top notch too, being from Sony who has been making cameras and camera lenses for a long time. The other nice thing is the battery life, since it has a good sized battery paired with a smaller screen, the screen actually drains the battery less than on the bigger devices. When I first bought it, I was easily getting 2 days of battery life but now that is more like a day or day and a half depending on my usage.I actually ordered it here unlocked because nobody else is carrying it in the US. When mine arrived, the menus were all in Chinese, but a quick YouTube search showed me how to switch them back to English and I was all set.I'm a big Android fan so I was weary of what kind of bloatware Sony might have installed on this. But it's really not bad at all and feels very similar to a pure android experience. There are a few little things that are different and you can uninstall any of the Sony pre-installed apps without any issue. Mine was also recently OTA'd to Marshmallow which seemed to improve performance quite a bit.Overall, I'm so happy I bought this phone. It's the perfect size if you're looking for a small Android device and has enough processing power to keep up with the latest devices. Oh, the built in fingerprint scanner in the power button is super nice too, as is the physical camera shutter button. Both of these are features I use daily. (Note: I heard that the US spec phones won't have the fingerprint scanner, so be sure to check if that matters to you.)"
good
"I really wanted to like the Xperia Z5 Compact. It had all the things I wanted and it was the right size for my hands. However, it would not communicate with my internet provider. I had contacts with Sony and with Verizon and followed all their advice as to how to fix it. They both ended up blaming the other. So there was no recourse for me but to send it back."
"I love this phone! The size is perfect. It fits in my pocket just fine. The ability to record in 4k is really cool and the quality of the video seems very very nice, even when just played back on the phones display. The display is very sharp and gave me a headache for a day or two but I seem to have adjusted now. Apps load very fast. I am using the At&t nano sim through straight talk and everything is working just fine.The only downside so far is the camera loads fairly slow. My boyfriends iPhone 6 loads the camera and takes six photos by the time this phone loads and takes one. Other than that I am overall pleased with the phone."
I love it
I love it
It was everything I was expecting it to be
"I bought the Sony Xperia Z5 compact and so far it's been a terrific phone. I love this phone so much because it has a long battery life, Android marshmellow, and good camera but let me tell you about the cons.Cons: my number 1 reason why I HATE this phone is the fingerprint lock. My friends saw some private pictures of my girlfriend and I., I was harassed me. it's suppose to be under my fingerprint and my friends can access itSecond: I got in a car rekt after the beach and my phone was dead. It Cannot charge in ANY car. I tried to use multiple chargersThird: I get made fun of cause this phone apparently looks old"
"it was set in Chinese language, was a challenge to turn it to english. But other than that, it works and looks great"
"Good phone, just a little small for me, and the camera is a little slow to wake, things like battery life and general performance are great though, if you need something small and powerful you cant go wrong here."
"Very good, attention fine"
Nice compact phone. Good camera. Screen is 1280x720 but not a biggie cause of the size so its not really noticeable. Battery is not as good as my z1s.
"Excellent phone, arrived in perfect condition and after nearly a month of using, I am quite satisfied with the features of this phone. Was compatible with T Mobile, has a nice fingerprint scanner on the side, though did not come with a headset."
"I'll start by saying this phone is the perfect size, I really wish more phone manufacturers would make phones this size. Also the camera is great and on equal level with a galaxy S7. Unfortunately the phone gets pretty hot under normal use, and the UI is very buggy which makes the phone unenjoyable to use. Hopefully by the end of 2016 we will have more phones that are around this size and not be so limited in our phablet... I mean phone selection."
"It's just a great handset. Good size, takes the best photos ever, runs every app under the sun, really appreciate having the removable memory card."
"Sweet! Like the packaging, fits perfectly... In one word quality. I can't seem to put this phone down, it's perfect.."
Les recomiendo!
So disappointed. Bringing up the camera lags and even worse it takes two seconds to capture the picture. I now understand why Sony decided to discontinue it's Z products. So much potential here though. Sigh
"Great phone, I love it"
"I found that after using the phone's internet browser for just a few minutes, the phone started to get very hot until eventually it was too hot to comfortably handle. This should not happen. Perhaps my phone was defective. Has anyone else ever experienced this problem? I am sending the phone back, but am unfortunately responsible to pay return shipping fees. Hopefully they will not charge me a restocking fee..."
"Great phone, beautiful design, fast shipment"
"I had high expectations or this phone as a previous z1c and z3c owner. The z1c had the highest build quality in my opinion (the metal casing exuding the appearance of ""high-end""). The z5c is a step down from here, although the performance is updated, the phone does not look or feel high-end in your palm. This isn't a huge deal to me as I primarily use this phone for travel; the small size, waterproofing, and low-key appearance are all assets. However unlike the z1c, I don't enjoy using the z5c at home in the states. One big gripe for me has been the fingerprint scanner. The iPhone will read and unlock my prints 90% of the time, the z5c is probably more like 60% for me. I'm sure experiences will vary.In all its a mediocre phone, but given the choices out there, it is by far the best Android in this size. The vanilla-like Android experience Sony installs is appreciated as well-- its the closest you can get out of the box without buying a Nexus imho."
good
"I bought this for my wife, to replace her (still functional, just aging) Moto G LTE (1st Gen). If you're looking at this product, you're probably aware of the general lack of high-end, small-form-factor Android phones. If you want high-end, you usually have to get something substantially larger than this, and my wife did not want a larger phone. She also wanted something with a much better camera. The z5 compact delivers. She's had it a month now, and she likes it a lot. (I've used it quite a bit as well). The camera is responsive and extremely high quality - it does fairly well in low light as well. The battery life is nothing short of outstanding. Sony's take on Android squashes battery consumption when the phone is idle, even with background apps (facebook messenger, facebook, various google services) all running. I've used a moto x (1st gen), moto x (2nd gen), moto g LTE (1st gen) all recently -- this phone has markedly better battery life than those. It's also stable and fast - the only (very) minor gripe one could have about this phone is Sony's mild modification to the UI, which is not stock. I don't really like the blue menu bars on settings & so on, but once the thing is set up, you shouldn't have to go in to those... so this is mostly a nonissue. Also, the Sony/xperia migration tool made migrating sms messages, pictures, and so on a breeze. This phone is fantastic.Regarding cell coverage and compatibility, we use this phone with Cricket Wireless, which is an AT&T MVNO. The ""bars"" meter apparently is calibrated a bit lower than other phones (ie, displaying 3 bars vs 4, etc), but the actual dB reading is the same as my moto phones on the same carrier in the same location. I'd expect this phone to work absolutely fine with post-paid AT&T service as well, seeing as how it works without issue on their prepaid subsidiary. I cannot vouch for whether or not the carriers can actually activate a new SIM on this phone, however -- I took her old SIM (already activated), cut it, and put it in this phone, which worked fine. I did have to put in the access point (AP) settings, but that's standard practice if you're used to Cricket or other prepaid carriers.re: warranty, I get squaretrade warranties for phones anyway. I'm not sweating the alleged lack of US warranty, though other reports are mixed as to whether Sony would really give you the cold shoulder if you had a legitimate hardware issue with the device.The phone came with an international AC converter to convert it to US 120V to... something else. I live in the United States. I'm not intimately familiar with exactly what kind of converter this is. It comes with a US 120V to USB charger in the box, and then is bundled with this international AC-to-US120V-AC adapter outside. It also has a pair of earbuds in the box."
"too hot, the terrible 810"
"So this isn't actually black. It's a gunmetal grey. I originally settled for black because none of the other colors appealed to me and I am glad that I did now. The color of gunmetal grey looks wonderful and the phone itself is above and beyond all of the ""competition."" The phone is smaller than most smart phones these days but does anything and everything you want it to do. It even has one of the fastest (if not the fastest) processors onboard. My only issue is that it does get a little hot if you're using it for an extended amount of time to do anything too extreme. Wonderful phone though, I made sure to order plenty of tempered glass protectors for the front and back to ensure that I keep this little gem safe. Would highly recommend."
"Phone arrived in 2 days. I am a US customer looking to use the unit with ATT. I received it on Tuesday, and end of day Thursday today, the phone is fully setup customized and functional, but for the carrier. I had some lingering items to wrap up on my old phone, and today I'll be getting ATT service connected. My goal was to keep a smaller phone (~4.5"") like my previous unit to preserve the 1 handed capability, and convenient pocket fit. I don't want a tablet for a phone, and have struggled to find a good modern model match for my needs. The Z5C looked to be a great match, and so far, it's a perfect fit for me.Package appeared to have been opened, however carefully, and then re-sealed. I suspect the reason it was opened was the addition of a US plug adapter for the EU style plug the unit comes with, as it does not look like a Sony converter. Where the phone uses a pretty standard 5V, 1500mA mUSB charger, of which I have a bunch, this wasn't a big deal. All other packages in the box (headphones, USB cable, extra earbud cushions, documents) were all intact and looked brand new, untouched. Phone itself still had original sticky film and packaging, and was in perfect new condition.Phone turned right on, and was ~60% charged. I was prompted quickly to change the language (second or third screen) as I ran setup from German to English I organized the OS as I prefer my phone laid out and set up and connected to wifi. The phone immediately ran two major system updates in parallel, and then after a restart, ran another. I'm now on Android 5.1.1, and admittedly, I'm not sure what it shipped with before the updates as they happened so fast.I love the square edges, which allow for some grip in a smartphone world where everything is slick and like holding onto a watersock if you don't have a cover on it. The phone looks like a sleek, black slab of sexy tech. Seriously, what a cool looking, striking design. The photos don't do it justice. I did buy a low profile cover for drop protection, and have used it intermittently. Compared to the IPhone 6 or the new Galaxy Edge, this is much easier to hold one handed without worrying about it squirting onto the pavement. That said, it's still a pretty slick and smooth piece of hardware in general, and I'd suggest a cover/protection.The phone is a great unit, and a perfect fit for my needs. I love the frosted glass back, the large screen/body ratio, and the charcoal colored polycarb frame.. I know some people take stars away for not liking the case/finish (non metal), but I find that odd. If you don't like it, why'd you drop $500 on it? It's a first class material, so the rest is just opinion. It actually has a pretty metallic look anyways. No one's going to look at this and say ""man, what a cheap looking phone. I promise. Phone does get a bit warm (which I really only experienced during the initial startup/setup), but there's a lot of horsepower in there, and that's to be expected. Nothing that bothered me.The fingerprint tech is awesome, and responds quickly and flawlessly. I have a few different fingers stored so that it's a comfortable unlock both righty and lefty. The hardware is clearly sufficient, as I've had a dozen things going on at once including downloading, a bluetooth beam, installing and updating apps, surfing a few internet tabs and writing a note all at once, and Android ran smooth, slick, quick and didn't break a sweat. Phone a very *solid* feel, very high quality, and certainly a first class phone that can be discussed in the circles of the current high end smartphone competition.Two minor drawbacks that I didn't think were worth removing a star for:1) No wireless charging. If the unit didn't have the rapid charge capability, this may have been a -1, but it charges so damned fast, and keeps charge so long, I couldn't do it. Still would be cool to drop it on those powermats at starbucks. Oh well.2) Volume buttons are too low on the thumb side (righty.) These should have been up top. I'm guessing there was a hardware conflict, but either way, it's a nitpick worth mentioning.Setup with personal and work emails was seamless, and calendar, emails and contacts all downloaded via wifi quickly and easily.I'm headed to ATT to finalize my new account and get the carrier service completed. Unless you see a follow up note from me, assume it also went smoothly."
"Great smartphone, excellent build quality, screen size, and hardware (64bit octacore Snapdragon 810 processor). If you are looking for something comparable in size to the iPhone but want more options and memory and no iOS then this is the perfect device for you and the fingerprint scanner on the power button was a brilliant idea.Due to the 64 bit processor and the 810 processor instructions 2gb of memory has no lag compared to the same system running on a 80x series processor.Great job Sony!Update 12/23/2015I am returning this device constantly runs hot ~143F without video recording, when using google maps or other apps, just beware."
"Pros:One of the better small screen phones still available on the market.Water resistance means you can wash it when it gets dirty, and you won't need to worry about dust getting inside, as long as the flaps are closed properly.Good for one handed usage.Fingerprint scanner works very well.Cons:I got a defective unit with a front camera that partially works. A portion of the picture will turn out yellow due to the broken camera.The design pretty much means this phone is only usable in the right hand. Not very nice for a lefty phone holder."
"I've had a Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, and S4. I understand some people like big phones, however, that's not my preference. That's why when the S5 came out, I started looking for something else. Then I found the Sony's Xperia Z Compact phones. I had originally wanted the Z3+ (Z4 elsewhere), but right when I was about to buy it, the Z5 Compact came out. While it's not available in the US via normal retailers, I was able to get a warranty for it via SquareTrade. So that made it a no brainer for me. I've had it for a few months now and I'm still loving it."
"It's been a few weeks and having no issues so far. The white color looks great. Good form factor but when the phone gets hot, it becomes uncomfortable to hold so I def recommend a case. The phone is also a bit thick though I suppose it's necessary due to the waterproof material and other hardware necessities to make it up to par with typical devices.The SIM and SD card slots are easily accessible. Fingerprint sensor works great and is super convenient. Battery life lasts a full day but I don't see it going past a full day on normal usage (I'm typically on wifi and 4G). Sony also releases frequent software updates which is amazing compared to manufacturers like Samsung and HTC that take forever to come out with updates. Recently there was a update which allows the camera to launch much faster."
"Awesome phone. This phone is snappy and can handle doing multiple things at one time without slowing down. I have had it for over a month and it hasn't done anything out of the ordinary. Battery life is phenomenal, especially with the stamina mode on. Camera is sweet. This is a phone I can trust. Nothing about it seems fishy. It's fast and reliable and fits in my hand much better than those giants that are passing as normal size phones nowadays. Thank you Sony :)"
"Coming from the Z3C, I can't help but make some comparisons to that phoneThe good:• Shipping was very quick• Phone was flawless in its original packaging• Very quality build and heft to it. Doesn't feel cheap or plasticky at all.• Screen is nice and bright. Call quality is excellent.• Easy to navigate screen interface one handed. Holding it correctly, with your pinkie under the bottom to support the phone, there should be no issue using one handed. Your thumb should be able to reach all spots on the display. As far as I know, this is the only newly released premium handset in this size/form factorThe bad:• Like the Z3C, the back is glass, although frosted this time so the grip is slightly better. Premium feel, but very fragile.• Despite the faster CPU, the interface is slower and not as instant as the Z3C when opening apps.• Battery life is not as good as the Z3C, but still better than any other premium smart phone out there. I was charging every other day with the Z3C, but must charge at the end of the day with the Z5C. This is with moderate use.• The camera is just above average. With Sony optics you would think it would be better than it is.• When taking a photo, the camera is slow to open, and even slower to preview a picture just taken. Can be an issue when trying to catch a moment at just the right time.• For T-mobile, although the hardware supports band 12, T-mobile's 700MHz spectrum, it is not enabled. So you may find spotty reception in areas where you had excellent reception in the past with a T-mobile phone purchased from the carrier. This is more a carrier issue than Sony, since the support is there built into the hardware."
"I love the phone. I was however informed before buying, that the phone would be compatible with the T-Mobile network, but it is not 4G LTE compatible, so I feel like I have been lied to by omission."
"Loved this phone that minute I held it.comfortable nice style, great pics, fast. Works great with t-mobile. The upgrade from z1 was worth it.can't comment yet about battery only have it for 3 days so far no complain but I'll get back on review next month"
"I am satisfy the appearance of the phone, the system is good for me, the weird thing is the phone is Taiwan version not US.The other bad thing is I don't know why I can't open the mobile data, I am not sure it is hardware issue or software bug..."
"I just got the Z5C. Actually it lagged a bit first, but it doesn't right now as it gets warmed-up. I also was thinking the plastic frame would look a bit cheap, but it looks beautiful. I was just surprised that everything was written in Chinese first lol. It's in English now. Anyways, Z5C looks different from Z3C."
"Just got my phone today, haven't gone to t-mobile to activate it but have got it all set up with my google account and so far its AMAZING!!! great service! i had the bonus that my phone came with a head set also.not sure if sony sent it that way or NGP added them but either way. i was super excited. cant wait to try it out once on cell carrier and see how this beauty runs. right now its firing on all systems! thanks for making my day."
"I am a previous owner of the sony xperia z3 compact. This version came with a micro USB cable, power brick, headphones, and some manuals( mostly were not in English). The phone will have android version 5.1.1 (lollipop) straight out of the package with a few pre-installed software that you can delete. After just receiving this phone I noticed that the design was different, and the original fingerprint magnet glass on the rear of the phone from the z3c is replaced by frosted glass. So No more finger prints. Also the phone is slightly more thicker than the z3c and the edges are more round with a matte feel to it. There is only one flap on the left side to insert a memory card or micro SD card on the side. The volume keys are now under the power button which needs getting used to for me. The phone can be charged from the bottom using a micro USB cable which is included. You no longer have to open a flap to charge the phone which doesn't change the fact that the phone is still water proof/resistant. The power button is now longer providing a finger print sensor which works flawlessly so far. I haven't got much time into the user interface but have noticed that the display is very dim compared to the z3c if the adaptive brightness setting is on. So far it feels responsive, no lag, a few tweaks in the UI, and 4G LTE works fine for me. The camera is now 23 MP with fast auto focus, and the front facing camera is 5 MP. Overall great phone, but design could have been better and display is still 720p.UPDATE: Dropped phone on concrete from just above 3ft (with no case), and slightly dented the phone's edge. Screen survived any cracks or damage and phone still works fine."
"I love the Xperia compacts. They are great size, and fast performance. I don't know why people rave about camera. The quality of the camera is pretty nice, but the software that Sony runs is really slow. Sure, the camera is great, but it takes forever for the camera app to load and and focus on shots. The speed of the phone I love. The weight of the phone is more on the heavier side. I wish it was lighter and also thinner. The phone is a little thick and the volume rocker is in an awkward position. I like the dedicated camera button and I love the features the phone comes with inside its settings. I don't enjoy the placement of the front camera and it also takes some crappy photos as compared with photos taken from the front camera on the iPhone. I wish the apps were faster at loading and taking action."
I was using iPhone for a long time and I'm looking for a small android device that can last me through a day. I'm glad that I stumble upon this Sony Xperia z5 compact. It actually can last me over a full day of usage before I have to charge it. I love the small form factor with all the high end components. I'll stay with this Sony line for a while.
 There is a lot to like about the phone but there are a variety of issues too:1. Most importantly: this phone has a problem with touchscreen sensitivity in the lower part of the screen when the phone is not held in hand. It is particularly bad on some surfaces such as on a bed. Also the problem gets much worse if you install a glass protective screen. It starts being very noticeable on almost all surfaces.I've made a quick demonstration video about the issue (see below). Other users have reported this issue with their phone https://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Xperia-Z5-Z5-Compact-Z5-Premium/z5-compact-touchscreen-acting-weird/m-p/1079627/highlight/false#M6713Therefore it is a design defect by Sony. Surprisingly it appears to affect only the white version of the phone.2. It does heat up quite a lot during normal use (like updating apps) or watching videos. And the battery is drained faster than on previous version that I have (Z1 Compact)3. I didn't see any improvement in photo quality compared to the old Z1 (in fact some pics look worse in identical settings). At the same time there is a substantial improvement in focusing and in video quality.
"I have had this phone for 2 weeks now, and I still have things to evaluate, but so far these are my observations when compared to the features of my prior Galaxy S4 miniFirst pros. this is truly an amazing phone with so many features well beyond my previous Samsung S4 mini. The screen is great, and let's you choose enhancements to it that make pictures and videos really stand out. A 23 MP camera, take very good (albeit large sized) pictures; I have yet to try it in darker situations, where apparently it has been challenged in other reviews. It runs smoothly even when multiple apps are open, and its a breeze to switch between apps. The finger scanner works neatly, although the location will only allow you to use it with your right hand; you can also set up multiple users or guests to the phone, with their own apps, settings and finger scans (kind of like a computer profile), which is great for kids not messing up your settings. It has a ton of customizable phone features for screen, power management sounds, app management, that I was no where close to have with the smaller Galaxy -you can program what the phone will do when you plug it to the charger, when it connects with your car's bluetooh, or when you plug in head phones, so different apps can activate automatically. I do not own a PS3, but apparently you can hook it up somehow to PS3 controllers and play games through it (sounds like a cool feature); it also offers you a lot of connectivity options to external devices like Chromecast. Something I really liked was the corrector/dictionary, actually allows me to type in two different languages and word suggestions come in both without specifying or switching between languages,while keeping your keyboard in the desired setting. Aesthetically the phone looks nice, with a smooth finish front and back; the side material does look on the cheap side though, it would have been nice to have metal on the side instead, but that may hamper the waterproofing capabilities (it says waterproof, but I have n o intention of testing that on a phone w/o warranty). The back is also made of a glassy finish, which does make it a bit slippery in your hands. Finally, the size of the phone (the main thing that drove me to it) is great for its category; Sony really put a lot of features into a small package, making it feel like a flagship rather than a 2nd tier mini version you find of other smaller phones.So for the cons: Its not really the phones fault, but this is a european phone on american network, which means its not fully compatible (at least with Tmobile). It lacks the 3G 1700 band, all other bands apparently are the same as Tmobile network. This has the phone constantly switching between 3G and HSDPA and will drain the battery out in a day or less. I tried the phone for a week in Florida (Ft Lauderdale area) and in Texas (Houston area) and it is about the same, in spite of being large metropolitan areas. I cant tell exactly if HSDPA is equivalent to 4G or 4G LTE connectivity speedwise, so when it is on that it seemed fast-ish. When I mean constant switching I mean sometimes you would actually have to move the phone around so it would get the signal right and download things. This, added to the low battery life, is somewhat annoying which is sad, because the phone does have these apparently great customizable battery saving features that tell you you should have the phone for more than a day without charge, of course it does not count on the phone switching between networks so frequently and battery barely lasts a day with moderate use.Maybe the phone works better on other carriers, it is truly unfortunate that Tmobile/Sony have not agreed to provide this phone on the US market, it is really an awesome phone by itself. If someone knows how to do away with the network issues, or of a carrier where it will work well, let me know"
"Phone is great takes awsome pictures, Bluetooth is a little slow, but i dont use Bluetooth for more than audio. very convenient size"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3bWribaf04I have the problem exactly the same as shown in the video on YTB, and I'd like to know if the problem is only with white z5c?if yes, Can I change for another color?"
"I bought this phone to replace iPhone 4S for my wife. I bought this phone based on my experience with Xperia Z3 for more than a year. I was impressed with the phone battery life, the normal usage definitely gets one full day. I still need to play with the settings to get to two full days of battery. The apps open up fast, the phone is very compact, easy for one-handed use. The finger scanner works very well."
excellent
"**SEE UPDATE BELOW**I've been using this phone for over 3 weeks now and I so glad I went with the Z5C.HARDWAREIt heats up a bit when doing heavy gaming or long video recordings, but not all too concerning...especially considering I don't notice any heat during typical daily operation. I would say the battery is adequate but it wouldn't be considered one of the strengths of this phone. I don't imagine battery life gets any better with other phones unless you go bigger...which, why the hell would you be looking at this phone if you were willing to do that? Go with the Xperia Z5. That said, I haven't experimented too much with ""stamina mode"" but if you use alternate messaging services / apps (like Google Voice) or music streaming apps, you'll have to add those apps as exceptions to be able to use data when the screen is off...which will diminish the benefit of ""stamina mode"" and preclude you from using ""ultra stamina mode"" all together. This is my first Quick Charge 2.0 device and I'm very impressed with how much charge you can get out of having it plugged in a just a while (ie 10 minutes). Wireless charging would've been nice to have but I'll gladly sacrifice that feature to get dual front facing speakers, expandable memory, and water resistance.Speaking of expandable memory. My buddy was playing with a camera-equipped drone his girlfriend got him for Christmas and was bummed he couldn't get the videos off the micro SD card (he didn't have an adapter). Everyone at the party (iPhone users) was blown away at how I was able to get and share the video by putting the micro SD card in my phone and using Google Drive to share it. I don't know why we are letting phone manufacturers sucker us by buying phones without expandable memory.At 720p screen resolution / quality looks great to me. If reading small text is difficult or annoying or you plan on watching HD full-length movies on your phone, get a bigger phone. I have excellent eyesight and find this display great for watching YouTube videos or reading articles.I don't take a lot of photos / videos but I'm pleased with the camera so far. You can find great camera comparisons online. From what I found this camera is great but Samsungs perform better in low-light and close up focusing...but the Z5C is a huge step up from my HTC One M7 when it comes to low light pictures.SOFTWAREI was a big fan of HTC's Sense UI and didn't know how I'd like Sony's UI as this is my first smartphone from them. After downloading an HTC-like free clock / weather widget, I like the UI a lot. Screenshots and screen capture are particularly easy and fun. Still waiting for Android 6.0 Marshmallow update that was promised (see summary below).SUMMARYAs far as I know the perfect phone doesn't exist but based on the other flagship phones available right now and my preference for water-resistance, expandable memory, and front facing speakers...I was prepared to give this phone a perfect 5 stars. I'm giving it 4 however because it would appear that Sony is following the lead of others by promising ""soon"" updates to the latest android version (6.0 Marshmallow) to help sell their new flagship phone but then making those of us who believed them and bought the phone wait around while the update is delayed. If the update comes prior to the new year I'll adjust my review to 5 stars. Almost 3 months for an update seems like enough time to tailor Marshmallow to their UI...if it was a priority.**UPDATE**This is the worst phone I've ever had. On paper it's great but I've never been so frustrated with lagging issue. I'll get a phone call while its in my hand and I'll mis the call because pushing ""answer"" is non-responsive. Killing apps helps a bit but I find myself restarting the phone a lot. I was hoping the Marshmellow update would help but its now March 8th & still no update. First & last time I buy a Sony phone. Since the Galaxy S7 is water resistant with expandable memory, I think I'll get it if a softwarw update comes soon & fixes my problems."
"Pros:+ Good display even with its only HD resolution still delivers vivid and beautiful colors.+ Good hardware specs (Snapdragon 810, 32 GB storage, 2 GB RAM).+ Good design & building Material.+ The place of the finger print sensor is in the same power button and the sensor response is perfect and fast.+ The size is just perfect if you want a small phone so you can handle it by one hand.+ Support SD card, one of the feature that most recent flagship phones now is missing.+ Good connectivity for both phone networks (support LTE, HSPA, GSM) and WiFi signals (support 2.4GHZ & 5 GHz).Cons:- The sound quality isn't one of the best.- The camera isn't that perfect specially with the auto focus.- The home screen little bit sluggish.- It could be much better if it has 3 GB of RAM."
"I use the cellphone for 5 days. Today I charge the battery for a while, when I get it, it was very overheated. I could not even turn it off for many hours when the battery finished. I would like to talk with the seller."
"Great Phone, the UI is the really cool, it feels and look awesome."
"If you want an Android *phone* - not a mini-tablet, something that fits in your hand and doesn't feel like a plate of armor in your front pocket - Sony is now the only game in town (and not in any USA towns...these are imports). I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings.I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the ""lip"" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases.I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone.Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled.Just buy it. I hope Sony sells enough to make Z5 Compact successors."
"This is the best phone I have ever had. The main features I was looking for in a new phone were small size and battery life and I don' think it gets any better than the Z5 compact. My previous phone was a Droid Mini because it was the smallest Android phone available on Verizon. I was hesitant to switch from Verizon because I had been with them for a decade, but I have had no problems so far on AT&T and the Z5 Compact performs great and feels great (much better than the plasticky Droid Mini). In terms of battery life I would take the Mini off of the charger at 7am and with light-average usage it would be dead by 4pm. The same routine with the Z5 Compact always shows more than 65% battery remaining at 4pm."
"It takes around 5 seconds to open the camera, which is very disappointing. The phone heats up very easily while doing intensive tasks. Size is comfortable to hold but the screen is a little worse than expected because it's 720p only. I returned this phone, but the most disappointing is that it's been three days since the return package arrived at seller but I still don't have my refund back yet."
"I've had a z3compact and my only complain is that I kinda like the design of the z3c better than this matte finish and kinda bulky z5c.other than that, fingerprint scanner is really responsive.. works about 80% of the time. battery life feels a bit shorter than my z3c but still manages to go for atleast a day and a half."
"When I first held this phone, I had the sudden urge to hum the James Bond theme.The Z5 Compact exudes class. There is no other way to put it. It's hands-down the most premium feeling phone I've held - and that's with it swinging against the big guns such as the S6 Edge, HTC One, and iPhone 6.Cons:-I'm not a huge fan of the frosted back, and think it would have looked better with a normal glass back or just a continuation of the excellent plastic used for the sides. This is largely personal preference though.-The volume rocker is in an extremely awkward position. Unlike the Z3 Compact, you really have to work to use it. Would have been better located above the power button.-It comes in Japanese, and it's very difficult to find the language setting. Pull down the notification bar, then again for settings, click the gear, scroll down to the keyboard, then the top setting.Pros:-The fingerprint sensor/power button is fantastic. It's placed perfectly, works fast, and has just the right feel.-Impeccable fit and finish.-Near stock android.-Design.-Specs.-Camera button, which is sadly a dying feature. The quick-launch ability alone makes it worth having."
"There really isn't anything like it available for purchase at this time. This phone is exactly what the iPhone users are hanging onto, a sub 5 inch phone with competitive specs. The 720p resolution is totally fine for the size of the screen. If you feel like it is a big sacrifice, just remember it improves the battery life (up to 2 days). The camera is pretty amazing and the expandable memory (micro sd) is also a breath of fresh air coming from an iPhone. If you want the freedom of Android and a reasonably priced phone (unlike the iPhone), then do not hesitate, BUY IT!"
"This phone is exactly what I've been looking for. I have small hands and would like it if it were even smaller, but I can't complain since it's pretty small compared to all the phones available now. I have att and it works great. The screen looks great, it's snappy, and I even like that it's not so thin. Really thin phones are hard to hold and even cramp my hands sometimes. Battery life is about average. Fingerprint sensor works great. Although battery isn't removable, SD and Sim cards are. I really wish Sony success because I'd hate to see this line of phones go away."
"I've had my device for one and personally it's just what I was looking for! Prior to the Z5C I owned the Z3 (5.2 in screen) and I love that phone but I wanted something a bit smaller in hand. At first I was kind of iffy going from a 1080 to a 720 display resolution but honestly you can barely tell a difference. You would really have to pay close attention to the screen to point out the difference. I am glad I wen with the Z5C, it is a premium phone in a compact size. I've yet to try the camera but I did video recorder for a few minutes and the 4K recording is amazing. How can such a compact device record so well and crisp! Thank you Sony!"
Phone has screen problem making it almost unusable... No warranty and $400+ down the drain. Very very unhappy.
Works as advertised.I wanted a phone that fit in my hands and pocket as a small person.Being able to text with one hand is a plus for me too.
"The phone has been working well so far, but I was disappointed by the thickness which is higher than my previous phone."
Great little phone
"This is awesome deal. Personally I like a compact device. In compact class, this is one of the best smartphone that I ever."
I love my Sony Xperia z5 compact!! It's comparable in size to the iPhone 5c just right for me and having an amazing sound and picture quality is a huge bonus!!!!
Not recommended to water
"This thing gets hot. I have a smart watch and due to some ultra sensitive touch screen it turns on in my pocket a lot. So two day battery life is totally a joke, Im lucky if i get a full day. I really love this phone and the camera is great but the battery is not as great as they say. side note the fingerprint scanner is about 80% accurate."
"Initially everything went well, however, the phone stopped charging in less than 7 months after purchasing from seller. The phone is defective as it should work longer than seven months. I would not recommend seller or phone products given my experience with both seller and/or their products.."
"The staff was dilevered in time, very fast. The quality correspond to price. Thanks for cooperation a lot."
"Note: Would have given it a 4.5 but had to round.The pros are so vast, so I'll start with the cons.Booting takes forever (especially the first), and it's set up in German (though the first option allows you to change that). AC Charger is (I'm assuming) German, so though the USB itself is universally compatible, you'll need to use or buy a different wall adapter.It's in Lollipop, I believe, and easily upgrades to Marshmallow (and even Nougat!) soon. However, it must charge halfway before you can do that (Was at about 10% for me), and the series of updates gets it *extremely* hot. Speaking of which, CPU overheating happens terrifyingly frequently, though I should say that I can't notice any performance problems, just the absurd temperature rise (115F+) and some battery drain.Pros:Now, the battery - when you have it in normal mode it's unremarkable. Drains at a standard rate. BUT, when you switch it to ""Stamina"", sweet baby Jesus. Essentially, it doubles the battery life. Of course, one would assume this takes a serious toll on performance - but only two (quite tolerable) perceivable changes happens. The brightness becomes to adaptive brightness what adaptive brightness is to 100%. Basically, it's a bit darker than adaptive brightness at 100%. Though, I already have it at adaptive - having it at full, 100% brightness before turning Stamina on seems to put it at regular adaptive brightness.That paragraph was aggressively confusing, sorry folks. The other thing is that internet apps such as Snapchat and Kik will not give you notifications *until you open them once after Stamina is on*. This means that Stamina force stops them, and you can get your notifications back once you open them. You can also make exceptions to what apps Stamina optimizes in the battery settings. I'm sure Stamina also strongly affects your network and internet speed/usage, so if you're an avid mobile gamer you might want to keep it off (or get the Xperia XZ!)Here's how long the battery lasts for me (if I were to do these individual tasks and only them straight from a full charge until it died):Standby: 2 days / Stamina: 4 daysInternet Browser (no videos): 12 hours / Stamina: 18 hoursMusic: 1 day / Stamina: 3 daysVideo (local or streaming): 6 to 9 hours for both, depends on quality and all thatCalls (video): 2 to 5 hours for both, again probably depends on qualityCamera/Recording (rear): See ""Video""Snapchat, specifically: Just... Just kill your phone. Just put it in the oven. Same effect.Info I can't help you with:Calls (audio): Well, I can't test that very easily, but I'd guess around 12Games: Hell if I know, I hate mobile gaming. Plus if you play games on a phone and you're considering a compact, you seriously need to rethink the way you choose your tech. But probably 6-ish.Oh boy, I've been waiting to talk about this part: MEDIA(23 MP) Camera: It's so yummy. The images are so crisp. The colors bounce off each other so well. You can take a picture of a freaking desk chair and it will be impressive. You have a host of size and focus settings, and a bunch of subtle (though you can adjust them to make yourself look like an idiot on Snapchat) color filters. And yes, there is 4K recording. But there's some Jekyll and Hyde going on here. Turn off one too many lights, and NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE. It will look like Barney the Dinosaur jammed his hand into a blender and tossed the bits all around like confetti. Use the flash.Display: They fit as much pretty as the can into a lackluster 720p size. You have a couple of settings that will allow you to add more realism or straight up saturation to your photos/videos. Motion is swift and crisp.Music: Dear lord, if you are an audiophile or even a pseudo-audiophile such as myself, get yourself a Sony phone. A few accessory/media specs before I go into this: I've been using Shure SE215 earphones to listen to mostly film scores (such as Hans Zimmer) and theatrical rock (such as Muse) on Poweramp Music Player with the EQ/Tone leaning slightly towards low bass, low mids, and high treble frequencies (and away from the rest).It's so beautiful. The instrumental separation is phenomenal. I can't describe it much in a way other than this - if your average phone is a kid flapping a leather cape from Spirit Halloween into a phone mic and playing it back through Beats headphones, this is the sound of Batman's cape fluttering in the wind as he dive bombs. It's sophisticated and elegant, but powerful, with deadpan presentation. It has closer to a monitor sound, rather than leaning towards bass or mids the way most phones do, so it's more customizable.You have a ridiculously, hilariously, mind-bogglingly expansive wealth of audio settings, from an algorithm that attempts to present 16-bit/44khz audio as 24-bit/96khz to Sony's classic dynamic normalizer to a truly absurd selection of surround sound settings. The in-house EQ is pretty lame, which is why I don't use their default music player, but the HR audio upgrade is compatible with power amp. You are also able to play originally 24/96 audio files *at that quality*! Your iPhones and your Galaxies won't do that. Shame that I'm sending that through 16/44headphones though, which defeats the purpose. Overall, sound quality is unparalleled by non-Xperias and the best part of the phone.Customization: Yes, there are themes, and some of them are pretty cool, but don't get them through the settings or the What's New app! Go straight to the Play Store. Try ""Cubot"" - it's free and customizes just about everything in Sony's UI to a *very* cool blue/black theme.TL;DR: Photographer: It's a great choice. Gamer: Stay away! Audiophile: Get this phone immediately!9/10"
Love it! Perfect size and color.
Had this phone for a year now. Good phone with good battery. I get nearly two days on a charge. Have never had low battery anxiety. Sony has done an OK job of updating. Marshmallow is nice and im looking forward to nougat. Camera is great. Having a camera strap on it is honestly my favorite part. It's so easy to get my phone out of my pocket and I never have to worry about dropping it. My only dislikes are some minor software issues like no recent apps showing from time to time and auto rotate not working sometimes and it taking 5 seconds to detect my aux car jack. I hope I get another 2 years out of this device because it's still exactly what I want in a phone and Sony's 2016 Xperia X compact is not even an upgrade.
The best cellphone ever.
"This phone is very sturdy (I drop things). The camera is amazing, and the whole thing fits in my pocket!"
Reviews about overheating frequently is true. Someone clearly had this phone before me even though it was advertised as new. It was set to Spanish language and had several downloaded apps. Battery drains much faster than it should for a new phone. Freezes often when switching between apps. I expected more from a new Sony Z5 but it doesn't really act better than my old Z3!
good good good
great phone
Good
"The Z5 compact is a solid phone. I wanted a smaller phone, with an actual FM radio, decent camera, and the Z5 compact seemed to fit the bill nicely. I dad some issues with the software on the phone not seeing our hidden Wi-fi network, even though the network was saved. But a reboot of our router seemed to remedy this just. Only remaining issue is my computer being able to access the phone over USB. This was possible with my previous phone, with just a USB cable, and without any additional software. However, this phone (or Android 6) seems to have taken away the ""Mass Storage"" option for USB, and the phone is suggesting software to be installed on my computer to be able to access it..."
"One of the best phones out there, compact waterproof with high specs what more would you ask for"
"The Z5C is a phone I wished that Sony would bring state side, but it appears as though plans to do that aren't in the pipeline. This is probably due to the bad marketing job from Sony in America, and a botched phone agreement with a couple of the big carriers. The Z5C is a phone for someone who values a compact size phone that has power, good battery life, good camera, and isn't looking to watch videos. There are plenty of reviews out there about what the critics think, but I just want to point out a couple of big wins for me.1. This phone allows me to stream music over bluetooth headphones while taking pictures at the same time. I value this because I work at a gym and usual do both things at the same time. When I take a photo there is no skip in the music. Everything is seamless. It is something that other phones can't do (Samsung S6 Edge).2. This phone has a very stock flavor of Android. While I wish it had marshmallow right now for the SD card system integration and doze features. Sony does plan on pushing out Marshmallow for this phone. For the time being, I'll just use the SD card slot for video and photos. The Stamina feature that Sony puts on the system appears to help a lot with battery longevity.3. I can use the phone on AT&T (Not verified) or T-Mobile (verified) workingPlease don't hesitate to ask a question about the phone. I was a little nervous about purchasing it at first, but worth it."
"I am a very basic phone user who kept my previous phone (Samsung Galaxy S2) for over four years before I finally had to give up on it. My phone is for texting, mobile emails, taking pictures and little else. I wanted a phone with long battery, compact size, and a great camera, and the Xperia Z5 Compact fits all of those requirements. I bought the unlocked version so I can take my phone abroad with zero issues, but I also like that it doesn't come bloated with the apps from American wireless carriers.The battery life has decreased slightly since I first got the phone, but I can still make it through two days without charging, even after using demanding apps."
One of the best compact size phones available. The finger print sensor works great and is located in the best possible place.
"great phone, great quality"
Excelente
love this phone
"Love the phone, exactly as advertised"
"Looking for a flagship with excellent camara in a compact form factor? This is the equipment you are looking for.The interfase is very polished.I REALLY REALLY love the unlock boton in the right side with fingerprint. It unlocks the phone supper fast.It is true that sometimes it get hot. But so far it is tolerable. It took me a long time to decide for this model because I read reviews regarding the ""overheating"" issue. In my case it is not a problem.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 23/03/2016Since Android 6.0 update I did not notice the hot issue anymore. The interfase is more fluid, the battery duration was improved. Be carefull with old reviews."
"I would love to give this 5 stars, but there is a problem. It wouldn't send or receive texts with pictures until a couple system updates provided a solution. There are some minor things I would change, but I'm happy with the phone now. For example It doesn't allow custom message sounds for each contact. Also the swipe to text doesn't seem to be as accurate as the galaxy. However the voice recognition is very good."
"I had the Z3c, replaced it with this Z5c. The 5 is a further polished version. If you are in the market for a high end phone and dislike mandatory two hand texting and holding a book to your head, this is for you."
"I've only had the phone for a week, so these are first impressions only. The phone is superb, everything I was hoping it would be. Call quality is excellent, it's fast, the camera takes *beautiful* pictures, tho as the reviews point out, low-light performance is good, but not stellar (they're a little painterly if you pixel-peep); and the battery lasts me 2 days, as advertised (tho I'm sure ""your mileage may vary"" applies, I don't do any gaming and don't watch or take a lot of video). The screen is excellent, but not quite as good as an AMOLED--the viewing angles aren't quite as good, and its version of ""black"" doesn't match an AMOLED black. Turn off adaptive brightness for the nicest-looking screen (tho at the cost of some battery life or convenience); I ended up turning adaptive brightness back on. Color reproduction seems better to me than my previous phone's AMOLED display (a now out-of-date Samsung flagship), making it better for photography. It comes with some bloatware, which I just uninstalled or deactivated. Overall after the first week: Very satisfied."
"Note: Would have given it a 4.5 but had to round.The pros are so vast, so I'll start with the cons.Booting takes forever (especially the first), and it's set up in German (though the first option allows you to change that). AC Charger is (I'm assuming) German, so though the USB itself is universally compatible, you'll need to use or buy a different wall adapter.It's in Lollipop, I believe, and easily upgrades to Marshmallow (and even Nougat!) soon. However, it must charge halfway before you can do that (Was at about 10% for me), and the series of updates gets it *extremely* hot. Speaking of which, CPU overheating happens terrifyingly frequently, though I should say that I can't notice any performance problems, just the absurd temperature rise (115F+) and some battery drain.Pros:Now, the battery - when you have it in normal mode it's unremarkable. Drains at a standard rate. BUT, when you switch it to ""Stamina"", sweet baby Jesus. Essentially, it doubles the battery life. Of course, one would assume this takes a serious toll on performance - but only two (quite tolerable) perceivable changes happens. The brightness becomes to adaptive brightness what adaptive brightness is to 100%. Basically, it's a bit darker than adaptive brightness at 100%. Though, I already have it at adaptive - having it at full, 100% brightness before turning Stamina on seems to put it at regular adaptive brightness.That paragraph was aggressively confusing, sorry folks. The other thing is that internet apps such as Snapchat and Kik will not give you notifications *until you open them once after Stamina is on*. This means that Stamina force stops them, and you can get your notifications back once you open them. You can also make exceptions to what apps Stamina optimizes in the battery settings. I'm sure Stamina also strongly affects your network and internet speed/usage, so if you're an avid mobile gamer you might want to keep it off (or get the Xperia XZ!)Here's how long the battery lasts for me (if I were to do these individual tasks and only them straight from a full charge until it died):Standby: 2 days / Stamina: 4 daysInternet Browser (no videos): 12 hours / Stamina: 18 hoursMusic: 1 day / Stamina: 3 daysVideo (local or streaming): 6 to 9 hours for both, depends on quality and all thatCalls (video): 2 to 5 hours for both, again probably depends on qualityCamera/Recording (rear): See ""Video""Snapchat, specifically: Just... Just kill your phone. Just put it in the oven. Same effect.Info I can't help you with:Calls (audio): Well, I can't test that very easily, but I'd guess around 12Games: Hell if I know, I hate mobile gaming. Plus if you play games on a phone and you're considering a compact, you seriously need to rethink the way you choose your tech. But probably 6-ish.Oh boy, I've been waiting to talk about this part: MEDIA(23 MP) Camera: It's so yummy. The images are so crisp. The colors bounce off each other so well. You can take a picture of a freaking desk chair and it will be impressive. You have a host of size and focus settings, and a bunch of subtle (though you can adjust them to make yourself look like an idiot on Snapchat) color filters. And yes, there is 4K recording. But there's some Jekyll and Hyde going on here. Turn off one too many lights, and NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE. It will look like Barney the Dinosaur jammed his hand into a blender and tossed the bits all around like confetti. Use the flash.Display: They fit as much pretty as the can into a lackluster 720p size. You have a couple of settings that will allow you to add more realism or straight up saturation to your photos/videos. Motion is swift and crisp.Music: Dear lord, if you are an audiophile or even a pseudo-audiophile such as myself, get yourself a Sony phone. A few accessory/media specs before I go into this: I've been using Shure SE215 earphones to listen to mostly film scores (such as Hans Zimmer) and theatrical rock (such as Muse) on Poweramp Music Player with the EQ/Tone leaning slightly towards low bass, low mids, and high treble frequencies (and away from the rest).It's so beautiful. The instrumental separation is phenomenal. I can't describe it much in a way other than this - if your average phone is a kid flapping a leather cape from Spirit Halloween into a phone mic and playing it back through Beats headphones, this is the sound of Batman's cape fluttering in the wind as he dive bombs. It's sophisticated and elegant, but powerful, with deadpan presentation. It has closer to a monitor sound, rather than leaning towards bass or mids the way most phones do, so it's more customizable.You have a ridiculously, hilariously, mind-bogglingly expansive wealth of audio settings, from an algorithm that attempts to present 16-bit/44khz audio as 24-bit/96khz to Sony's classic dynamic normalizer to a truly absurd selection of surround sound settings. The in-house EQ is pretty lame, which is why I don't use their default music player, but the HR audio upgrade is compatible with power amp. You are also able to play originally 24/96 audio files *at that quality*! Your iPhones and your Galaxies won't do that. Shame that I'm sending that through 16/44headphones though, which defeats the purpose. Overall, sound quality is unparalleled by non-Xperias and the best part of the phone.Customization: Yes, there are themes, and some of them are pretty cool, but don't get them through the settings or the What's New app! Go straight to the Play Store. Try ""Cubot"" - it's free and customizes just about everything in Sony's UI to a *very* cool blue/black theme.TL;DR: Photographer: It's a great choice. Gamer: Stay away! Audiophile: Get this phone immediately!9/10"
Love it! Perfect size and color.
Had this phone for a year now. Good phone with good battery. I get nearly two days on a charge. Have never had low battery anxiety. Sony has done an OK job of updating. Marshmallow is nice and im looking forward to nougat. Camera is great. Having a camera strap on it is honestly my favorite part. It's so easy to get my phone out of my pocket and I never have to worry about dropping it. My only dislikes are some minor software issues like no recent apps showing from time to time and auto rotate not working sometimes and it taking 5 seconds to detect my aux car jack. I hope I get another 2 years out of this device because it's still exactly what I want in a phone and Sony's 2016 Xperia X compact is not even an upgrade.
The best cellphone ever.
"This phone is very sturdy (I drop things). The camera is amazing, and the whole thing fits in my pocket!"
Reviews about overheating frequently is true. Someone clearly had this phone before me even though it was advertised as new. It was set to Spanish language and had several downloaded apps. Battery drains much faster than it should for a new phone. Freezes often when switching between apps. I expected more from a new Sony Z5 but it doesn't really act better than my old Z3!
good good good
great phone
Good
"The Z5 compact is a solid phone. I wanted a smaller phone, with an actual FM radio, decent camera, and the Z5 compact seemed to fit the bill nicely. I dad some issues with the software on the phone not seeing our hidden Wi-fi network, even though the network was saved. But a reboot of our router seemed to remedy this just. Only remaining issue is my computer being able to access the phone over USB. This was possible with my previous phone, with just a USB cable, and without any additional software. However, this phone (or Android 6) seems to have taken away the ""Mass Storage"" option for USB, and the phone is suggesting software to be installed on my computer to be able to access it..."
I'm happy I upgraded from Nexus 5.Waterproof and good camera will allow me to retire my Panasonic TS3. This will reduce number of devices I pack and eliminate the need for taking a TS3 picture for quality and a phone picture for public WiFi email.
"Great form factor, battery life, and performance. Kinda sucks that they dropped the magnetic charging pins from the Z3C. And it's a bit offensive that they blow away their DRM keys when you unlock the bootloader."
"Sony Xperia z5 Compact is the ONLY small size smartphone with true premium specs. It is way above and beyond the competition. I'm not going to go over phone's features in this review as they are all well discussed in many publications. I do want to comment on 3 features the phone has been critised for unfairly in my opinion: First is the price - some critics say it is too expensive. Give me a break! The phone costs $450 plus $40 you have to shell out for 128GB SD card. That is $500. Compare that to iPhone 6s or Samsung Galaxy 6s with 128GB at $850 & $900 respectively and you will realize that Sony phone is a bargain. And that is comparing apples to apples because Sony phone is surely on par features and quality wise with both Apple & Samsung. The second point of criticism is the lack of 1080p HD screen. Again give me a break! On 4.6"" screen you will NEVER notice the difference between 720 and 1080p resolution no matter how good your eyesight is. And finally the lack of fingerprint sensor on us version (it is available on the international version). In opinion of many experts in the field the fingerprint technology is not mature enough especially both security and reliability wise. Most importantly it takes me virtually the same time to unlock the phone with a 4 digit code as with a fingerprint scanner - I tested it many times on my wife's iPhone 6s. So get over it or get an international model if you can't. Thank you Sony for the awesome phone!"
great
"I really wanted to like this phone. On paper, it had all the specifications I wanted. Unfortunately the overheating issues are true. On just the setup of the phone, it started warming up and became hot to touch. I can't imagine holding this up to my face or trying to hold it for extended amounts of time. It's a bummer because I haven't found another compact phone of this size with the features this one had.If you aren't bothered by a hot phone, then this is a great phone. Otherwise this is not the phone you are looking for."
Very good everything worked as expected ! Phone was unlocked with full LTE coverage.
Gréta:)
This is our families' 5th Xperia phone. The phone itself is the very best we've owned. Only drawback is the extremely poor customer service and long repair times if service is required. Any form of repair by Sony will cost at least a month without your phone and it is impossible to contact their repair facility. Would give a five start rating to each of the Xperia phones we've owned if Sony had better repair service. I miss the magnetic charging port on previous models.
Very good phone for less money
Exactly what I was expecting.
The phone does what it needs to do.
Amaaaaaaaaazzziiinnnnn little phone 📱
"I want to write an update for this phone. I now had this phone for 8 months. The marshmallow update 6.0.1 fixed all of the cons of this phone. Phone does get warm to the touch but that is during heavy usage. This happens when you spend 2 hours streaming or playing games and the battery drops down to 10%. You then plug it in to charge and resume your constant streaming and games.The phone does get slow when you have like 10 apps running at once. But that's with every phone. What I did enjoy was some photos i took underwater. See Photos. I really enjoy how it is somewhat water proof. Please know that it was under water for maybe less than 20 seconds.__________________________________________________________I just recently bought this phone 7 days ago. The shipping was prompted and the item looked well. This phone is really good but once the memory usage gets past 80 percent, it lags. If you are going to buy this phone, take out all the preinstalled app you wont be using and only install apps you will be using on a regular basis. It worked better after i got my memory uses below 70%"
"So I have been waiting for this phone to be available for a LONG time and am so glad it stands up to virtually all my expectations. If only they could have made it a LITTLE smaller!So the first thing I want to note is that this DOES indeed work with Tmobile with no manual setup or configuration - I just went into the Tmobile store, told them I have a phone I want to activate, they gave me the nano-SIM which I put in, turned the phone on and everything worked including MMS messages - super simple!I tested Internet speed while cell reception was on 2 out of 4 bars LTE, and was getting an average of 4 Mbps.Even though T-Mobile's wifi calling won't work, I just installed the updated hangouts dialer app and I'm all set to make calls when off-network and on only wifi from my free Google number.I don't have very big hands, but can still hold use this with only one hand which is my main objective, and it looks great too! Front speakers are great and you can really tell the difference in sound when you turn the phone sideways and allow your ears to pick up the stereo effect.In regards to the camera, the automatic mode is great. However the maximum advertised resolution for both the front and back cameras is only achieved in 4:3, not 16:9 to match the wide screen, though 16:9 is available with slightly smaller resolutions.Battery life is great with stamina mode - after a full day of being connected to my Bluetooth and typical handful of calls and several texts though leaving Internet off, I got home at 5:30 with still 93% remaining!No overheating issues as some have mentioned - it was barely even warm after playing a graphically intense game for over 20 minutes +Overall very happy with this phone, and I have high hopes for durability."
"works well. beautiful device. too bad Sony doesn't market it well over here in US. And also too bad it took forever to get US version. But a great Android phone, great quality. Awesome battery life!"
"It worked great for one month and since then has only been s***ier. After bad, it gets worse and worse. Among the main problems there is that keys keep being pressed while locked (for example in your pocket) so every time you need it your phone you need to go through an identification process because it thinks you have been trying to enter the passcode too many times. It is also super slow and crashes all the time. I never had a phone as bad as this one. I think its gold reviews are probably based on the initial experience which, as I said, is not bad but quickly goes downhill."
good phone
"I'm a former iPhone 5 owner and I bought this phone because I wanted an android smartphone with the same compact form factor, without sacrificing the features I'd gotten used to. The Xperia z5 compact is slightly taller and wider than the iPhone 5, but still very easy to use with one hand (the same can't be said for most other smartphones on the market!)The build quality of this phone feels great - it's got a slick glass body with a hard plastic bumper around the edge. The phone is water-resistant while still leaving the headphone and microUSB charging ports uncovered, which is a nice upgrade from the previous model (Z3 compact). Note that the phone is rated to be dust and water resistant, but not completely waterproof - Sony will not guarantee protection from activities like taking photos underwater. While I would've liked to be able to take my phone swimming with me, it's nice to know it'll hold up to rain, sweat and spills that could damage most other devices. The only flap on the phone's body covers the SIM card tray and SD card slot, but it's not a major inconvenience as you shouldn't need to access these often. It's tempting to carry this phone with no case but I'm cautious with glass-backed phones so I purchased a cheap TPU case for it in case I drop it and it hasn't been a huge compromise, it's still very pocketable. The power button, volume controls and camera button are all along the right side of the phone - another reason I like having a case on this phone is that it's possible to trigger the camera button accidentally if you aren't used to a hardware camera button.The 23 megapixel camera was one of the main selling points for me, and it's by far the best camera I've had on a smartphone! The hardware button is convenient for capturing photos quickly, although the camera interface takes a little longer to capture photos than the one built into iOS. The automatic camera settings do a decent job at capturing most photos, but if you'd like more custom options a fully manual mode is available with the swipe of a finger, along with a slew of presets for different subject matter. I replaced the stock camera app with an open source alternative because it's a little bit faster and compatible with some other apps I've installed on my phone.I've seen people complaining about bloatware, but in my experience just about every smartphone comes with some pre-installed apps. At least most of the pre-installed apps on the Xperia z5 Compact can be deleted, unlike Apple's stock apps (which I always end up putting in a folder out of my way, where they still take up precious memory). This phone comes with a generous 32gb of storage on board, but can be expanded up to an additional 200gb with a microSD card. Out of the pre-installed apps there were a few I found useful, including Sony's lifelog app, which acts as an activity counter and lets you compare your physical activity with smart detection of walking, biking or time spent in a car - as well as the activities you use your phone for, such as web browsing, gaming and listening to music. The 4.6"" 720p screen might not be the best on the market for gaming or viewing media, but the on board speakers impressed me compared to most other phones I've used, and screen size is a compromise I'm willing to make for a phone so small. Also packaged on board is Sony's Playstation remote play app, which allows Playstation 4 owners to play Playstation games on their phone. I can't speak to how well this works because I don't own the console, but I haven't experienced any lag so far playing mobile games on this phone (although the handset will heat up a little during more graphically intense titles).Overall, the Z5 compact has given me everything I want out of a smartphone during the first couple of weeks I've owned it, but I will update this review if I run into any issues. If you're looking for a small but powerful android phone that will survive daily life and occasional accidents, this is the one!"
No not really.
"good phone, I have not had a problem with heat issue. Iam very happy with purchase."
"It's a great phone, but the battery doesn't last 2 days as they say, and there is no headphones in the box."
"Phone is a great sizeBeautiful displayThrow feature is awesome for connecting your phone to DLNA devices and streamingHowever, phone runs hot, battery life is nowhere near what was advertised, and the side chassis seem to be coming unglued. Sony support is absolutely useless. I'll keep my cover on and hope it doesn't fail on me"
"I used to have the European version of the phone and I really loved it. I had a problem with the camera and couldn't fix it, so I decided to get the US version because I love the compact size and the processing power that comes with it."
"It's a great phone functionally, but whatever material they use for the screen will spontaneously decide to crack on you at some point. When that crack occurs, you will lose most or all touch functionality on your phone. If the crack happens to occur after a drop, no matter how slight or soft, Sony will refuse to cover it under warranty. Essentially, Sony is under the impression that an accidental drop is automatically ""misuse,"" despite the fact that I am not aware of a single person who has never dropped a mobile phone.I could swallow Sony's miserliness if it weren't for the fact that you can't even use your phone when the screen cracks. It is not purely cosmetic. Once your phone cracks, you MUST pay for a repair or buy a new phone as you lose all touch functionality on the phone. I don't know of any other line of phones that does this and I have only ever seen this problem with the Xperia line of phones. In fact, my previous phone was an Xperia Z2 Compact and I purchased the Z5 Compact after that phone had a screen crack that caused a cascading series of problems. Suffice to say, as much as I like the Sony line of phones, I will not purchase another anytime soon.UPDATE:To add salt into the wound, Sony is currently refusing to do even out of warranty repairs, meaning I'm stuck with either a broken phone or paying $145 for a repair at a local shop that cannot maintain the IP68 standard."
Excellent!
"I've been looking for a while for a small phone with good specs. This is exactly what I was looking for. There are zero other options if you want a phone this small with decent specs, storage, and Android Marshmallow. I have big hands, but the interface is smooth and easy to use. It isn't a ""small"" screen - it's what would have been considered a normal sized screen five years ago. It's solid feeling, gets good signal strength compared to my wife's iPhone, has a good battery life (with moderate use and no daytime charging I usually have 50% battery at the end of the day). The speakers sound decent when listening to music. Not superb, but much better than a lot of other phones and tablets I've used. Very usable for watching shows or movies using the built in speakers.High temperatures fixed: When it came in the mail, it had Lollipop installed. After the setup process, it felt quite hot. However, I then immediately did the over-the-air software upgrades. There were three updates in a row: The first an upgrade to Marshmallow, and then two more incremental upgrades / bug fixes. After those upgrades, it has never gotten hot again. A little warm, but comparable to any other phone I've ever used.You can uninstall or disable most of the Sony bloatware pretty easily, with the only exception being this What's Up app that was telling me about random celebrity birthdays and crap like that in the notifications. I got it to shut up and go away by disabling its data privileges.The camera is AMAZING. There is a built-in camera button, which I love. It has a two-level press like a real camera: soft press to focus, and hard press to snap photos. I wish the lens wasn't right on the corner though - I'm always sticking my finger in front of it by accident.My primary complaint is that I wish there was a hardware button bar at the bottom, so that the buttons (back, home, etc) didn't take up screen real estate. I guess that's a minor complaint though. I'm getting used to it, and they hide during videos or gaming.Note: if you want to use OTG devices, it isn't automatic. You have pull down and hit a button to attach OTG stuff. A little annoying, but if you're plugging in wired stuff to the mirco USB plug, you're not really expecting fast convenience anyway."
nice cell phone the only details its the finger detector. doesn't work because the phone it's from the us and in that region its not compatible
"Wow, what a great phone. I've never seen such stunning video quality on the phone. Just FYI my work phone is an iphone 6s.We got this for my husband unlocked to use on Tmobile. The sound is very very clear no issues there. Reception is great. Everything is fine.The camera quality is better than any other phone i've seen. No complaints so far.The phone size is just perfect. seems like every other phone company gets bigger can't even fit in the pocket but this one does!.One thing to note, didn't realize it only uses nano sim card. One quick trip to tmobile to upgrade old sim card. They come in 3 -1 now. So you can choose your size.Sony in my opinion has the best phones out on the market. Its too bad they didnt pick up the US, but i'm so happy they sell them unlocked for all of us in the states."
Really nice phone. Meets all expectations.
"I want to love this phone, but it overheats in 15 minutes after doing practically anything.A lot of the overheating can be delayed by uninstalling or disabling the Sony bloat apps. Unfortunately, the X-Mobile display enhancement adds to the overhead and when it's turned off, causes a lot of stuttering to go away.I was ready to live with the problems because of the beautiful case and size, but it's impossible. The overheating causes stuttering in the daily use after about 10 to 15 minutes of use.I think the only thing that could save this phone is a CPU throttling, but I just don't want to do that for a phone of this expense.REVISED: I lowered the star by one due to seller concern."
"This is the Z5 Compact (not any of the other size models). Terrific phone and bloody fast! I can't comment on its tumble ability (haven't dropped it so far!), however it seems as though the screen wouldn't crack unless dropped from a significant height on any of the edges, or slamming facedown into a hard surface.Quality of life has improved with this device over my old iPhone 4S. Very speedy with great connectivity, and a beautiful camera. Screen is vivid and bright."
"It's not reliable.Bluetooth audio works about half the time; otherwise it either skips randomly, requiring a restart, or plays the audio through the device speaker. I reboot it more often than Windows 98.Text messaging gave out entirely for a day, then came back randomly.I just reset it because I stopped being able to receive group messages from two of my contacts.Camera's not that great, though I came from Lumia.Android does not have feature parity with Windows Phone in regards to voice control; phone will not messages to me in the car at all without an app and even then I've lost the ability to respond.Battery life is okay, form factor is great.I have moved off many of the Xperia apps in favor of the Googles ones, that caused some improvements but it's still very unreliable."
"So far so good. Had to switch my provider since i didn't know about the different types of cell signals but the business that sold the phone put a warning about that in the box which was nice. The phone does get a little warm after extended use or when using some of the more demanding features like recording in HD, but i haven't really had an issue with it. I like the phone and supporting a small business is always a plus."
Where on earth do I begin. The screen is fragile I accidentally set a bottle down on it and cracked the screen purchased this phone because it was waterproof and I watched a video on YouTube with this kid dropping Hammers and whatnot off of a ladder onto this phone underneath 4 inches of water and I was under the belief that Not only was it waterproof but that it was nearly gorilla Corning Glass strong this is simply not true and the worst part is once you break the screen it will never be the same again Sony will not touch it if the screen breaks it's out of warranty specs in addition even if you can get this screen fixed which took me two months the waterproof install at the factory is special and no repair shop can get that installation repeated bottom line good luck otherwise I like the phone it's fast but too much bloatware totally
Does not come with US Warranty as described. Fantastic phone until the charging port failed and Sony refused to warranty it
"Not only is it deceptively advertised (no fingerprint scanner on US version), it ran super super slow, and only had something like 75% of the stated storage capacity. I have no idea how a product that defective made it to market, but I'm staying away from Sony phones from now on."
"I've had this phone for 4 months now and it is the best phone I've ever had! I've always used flagship samsung phones and found that they slow down within a few months. This has not been the case with the Xperia z5c! It is fast and snappy, I've been able to play Pokemon Go seamlessly, I frequently stream HBO Go from my phone and also use it for snapchat, facebook, texting, calling, instagram, and web-browsing. I usually get a day to a day and a half of battery life. This decreases if you have the GPS on though. Phone only gets hot when I play Pokemon Go but during nothing else. It charges really fast as well. I love the feel of the phone, it is sturdy and block-like but fits well in my small hands. I've dropped it several times and have gotten it wet and it still works like new. Well-worth the price!"
I switched to this phone from a iPhone 6S and I have to say I'm very happy that I did! Feels just as fast as the iPhone. Screen appears just as sharp and crisp as the iPhone even having a lower resolution. And the build quality feels premium. This is my first phone with front facing speakers and I have to say I do not want to switch back to anything els without them! Tested the water resistance and works perfectly. Fits in the hand great and is actually one handable for daily use. Even my normal size iPhone 6s was not. Also battery life is amazing in comparison to the iPhone. I could go two days if I wanted. I get home from a 8hour work day with normal use with around 50-65% battery. And some days that I'm busy and am not able to use my phone but a few times it will still be in the mid 90% range. Very happy I made the switch.Only con of this phone is the power button placement. I can deal with the volume rocker being in a weird location but the locm/power button is a headache. Every time I pick up the phone if I'm watching a video I accidentally hit the lock button because my had always grabs the phone on the sides right in the center.its a bad design flaw. But other than this the phone is perfect for me
This phone is excellent. Super fast and snappy. Everything just works well and the screen looks great. You can't even tell it's not 1080p. Best compact phone you can find.
I love the small size of this phone. The general trend is to phones much larger than what I want.
Excellent Phone
"I purchased this phone due to the higher end specs of the phone in the smaller form factor. At first I was disappointed to learn that they removed the fingerprint reader from the power button, but I quickly got over that since I hadn't had it yet in my prior phones. Overall I enjoyed the phone at first. The form factor was good along with several other aspects. I didn't appreciate all of the Sony specific software that was on it, but I was able to overlook that for a while. Within a few months though I started having issues such as the phone running slowly, apps crashing, and the phone running hot due to apps continually running. I also had issues with connectivity with using T-Mobile and by using a phone that they're not used to it seemed to complicate things. I ended up getting a Google Pixel lately which was a huge improvement."
Excellent phone
"Great compact size phone, good battery life"
"It does get hot, but meh, get off your phone after using it. Enjoy life. It does perform really well though for games and such. Also it's a neat little phone for its size."
"This is a great phone if you're looking for the 4.7 inch range in a flagship smartphone and not wanting an iPhone! If I could, I would give this product 4.5/5 stars as that is more accurate for me.I think Sony did a great job with this phone. The camera is excellent, with my only gripe about it being that they should have spent more time optimizing it so that it launches more quickly. It still launches quickly, but it's just not quite as snappy as, say, a Galaxy S7 camera. Still quick to snap though. The dedicated camera button is also an EXCELLENT feature. Very useful for when you're trying to really get a good focus on a picture.My second gripe is that, when you connect headphones or an aux cable to this device, this little thing pops up MULTIPLE times that says ""Improve your headphone experience"" in the notifications bar. This is no big deal to me, EXCEPT for the fact that it pauses whatever video/media you're trying to play! It does this about 5 times, and then it stops. I CAN'T disable this, I have looked around for hours in settings as well as on forums. It is a bug that Sony needs to fix, and I hate it!The only other minor gripe is that the phone is just barely not as snappy as I would expect from a flagship spec'd phone such as this. What I mean by this is that sometimes apps just take a split second too long to switch between and it can be slightly annoying if I'm trying to go fast. This is a minor gripe, however, and not something that would make me reconsider my decision to purchase or recommend this phone.Overall, I really like this phone and it is so nice to be able to use it one-handed. It actually makes my job much easier if I'm using my phone while running an experiment (i.e. looking at a protocol, running a quick calculation, etc.) I purchased this phone through Amazon's warehouse deals, and while the packaging came pretty meh, the phone itself was PERFECT. Not a single flaw that I could perceive, and I got it for $100 less than retail. No warranty, but I've never needed to use it on any of the 5 cell phones I've had. It's only a 1 year warranty anymore on most phones anyway."
"great phone,no over heating problems. had the z3 phone,liked it a lot too. cracked the bace being in my rear pocket.like that this has a different back."
"This phone has many great features and was exactly the size I was looking for. I was pleased with many parts of this phone. However, hardware failures and a even worse experience with dealing with this customer service for warranty work leaves me wanting to list 0 stars. -5 stars.Within six months, the camera sensor died. Total failure. Call the warranty service department and find that I must ship the phone, at my own cost, to a service center for at least 21 businesses days. ( This means a month). When it is returned after a month, the camera works but now has a blue glow added in all pictures with a flash. Secondly, now I cannot talk on the handset because the ear speaker doesn't work anymore. Call warranty service again. They want me to pay to ship it to them for another month. I complained to manager , Cedric. He assured me that he would be personally finding me another solution within 24 hours. That was there days ago. No word, no email, no call.I owned this phone since March 2016, broke in September 2016, returned October 2016 broken, and will likely be sent back again and kept until December.They should sell this phone as a two pack because it breaks down and the service is so poor you will need to buy another phone to cover while it is being serviced.Bottom line: great phone until something breaks. And several things will. Buy anything else."
It deserves five stars
"Amazing cellphone, great seller."
Great phone at a great price.
"This is a very nice phone.It is my second Sony phone, and a large leap in technology from my 2014 phone.It has an excellent camera, both front and back, easy set-up instructions, large micro-SD compatibility, and Android 6.x that supports installation of apps on the external SD."
"Finally, a full-powered phone that I can actually hold in my very small hands. This phone does everything I need and is one of the very few Android models out there that is not ginormous. I've got kid-sized hands so this is a big deal. Plus it actually fits in my pants pockets.Not super keen on the smaller-than average volume control buttons. But this is a small issue and acceptable tradeoff for the other phone benefits."
"Phone is fine, but I accidentally cracked the screen, and Sony is unable to fix the phone. I'm not looking for a warranty repair- just to get the phone fixed. But the Xperia service people say they can't take any out-of-warranty repairs due to some re-locating of the service department story, with NO ESTIMATE of WHEN THEY WILL START AGAIN!!!Sony- good phone. WORST SUPPORT EVER! Don't buy until you check the service/support!Update: They have now changed their story and have no plans to offer any kind of screen repair support. They have no plans to have any authorized 3rd party repair options either. Every mobile phone repair I have contacted also does not offer ANY sony phone repairs. BUYER BEWARE."
Very nice phone i love it!!
"Only thing keeping this phone at 3 stars for me is the fingerprint sensor being absent. Phone would be a home run if Sony had just included something that was already on the international version, it'd be one of the best phones I've had"
have to get used to it
"This is the phone that pulled me away from Blackberry!! Size does matter to me, as does battery life, build, and software. This Sony has it all. There are great enhancements to the OS and what I think are the best Android apps (top marks for the Mail and Calendar apps). Software support for the phone is great (PC backup, etc.) and I can't wait to try the Xperia Ear. If you are considering an Android phone or considering switching from iOS or BB this is your handset. As Sony isn't handled by any of the major carriers, please check compatibility at[...]"
"I owned the ""Xperia Z3 compact"" before and was pretty comfortable with it - until the display came loose at the upper right corner. I didn't realize that condition until I submerged the phone, testing the underwater skills which have been promoted in Sony's advertisements. The water entered and killed the phone. Of course these things are always going to happen after the warranty period... I suspect the high temperature of causing the seal to get loose. I live in a tropical area where the high noon temperatures sometimes reach the 100°F in the shade. Maybe the Z3 hasn't been in the shade...Nevertheless I purchased the ""XPERIA Z5 compact"" as successor of my previous phone as I'm enthusiastic about the SONY Xperia Z series. The Z5c hasn't many improvements compared to the Z3c, but I'm convinced of the new processor which makes the Z5c really fast. The autofocus is much faster and more precise.Until now the seals are tight even though I leave it sometimes in the sun. By the way, I noticed that SONY abandoned the previously promoted ""pool-underwater-sceneries"" in its advertisements, but only mentioned ""Doesn’t mind a little rain"". It seems to me that I've not been the only one with water-protection problems ;-)The missing fifth star is owed to 3 points:1. The battery doesn't last that long like the predecessor Z3c. The fast CPU takes its toll.2. It's the camera which really disappoints me. The Z3c had 21 Megapixels, the Z5c has 23 Mega. Too many in my opinion. Nice-weather-shots are OK, but since the majority of my Xperia photos consists of flash-photography, I yearn for my drowned Z3c.3. The US version - as the only one - has NO FINGERPRINT SENSOR! Why not???What conclusions did I come to? I'd buy it again and again! If you don't attach great importance to excellent low-light photos and are willing to charge the battery every day, the Xperia Z5 compact is a great phone to an affordable price."
I started with an Xperia Z1 I went to Z3 and was very pleased. I now purchased the Z5 compact and it is overheating all the timeI would like to return this item it is not what I thought it would be. Very disappointed in this product.. I was expecting a good product from Sony and it looks like they missed they boat.
"This is a good phone, but if possible get yourself a Z3 Compact instead. Despite the spec sheets you will see that claim that Qualcomm's newer processor is faster than the one in the Z3, the Z5 runs notably slower and hotter. Not that the Z5 is slow, just that I had the Z3 for over a year without experiencing any of the tiny lag hiccups I get with the Z5, nor did I ever notice any heat coming off the Z3 despite its slimmer size. The heat in particular makes me nervous about how well the Z5 will stand the test of time. There are some very minor design elements that are nice on the Z5, like the matte finish on the back and the position of the buttons/ports, but in my opinion these features aren't worth the slight decrease you get in performance."
"Wanted a small phone to replace my note 5 which was not working properly. I was fed up with the top brands as they would not work properly. And so decided to try a different brand.This phone looks really nice and it was nice to have a small phone. It is light too. It is a tad thick if you are used to thin phones. I liked the way the home screen looks.I hated the home button being on the side but would have got used to it if i kept the phone. What was really annoying is that you had to press the home button to wake it up and then swipe up to get to how you want to unlock it. I set it to tap the screen twice to wake it up but most of the time it would not wake up and ended up using the home button. Swiping to switch the alarm off seemed to take forever and sometimes there was a delay in apps opening when you tapped them so I am assuming that the screen is not very responsive.I decided to return it after a few days as I didnt want to be left with another phone that does not, in my opinion work properly, especially for the price.I now have a $90 LG phone which works great. It wakes up every time I double tap it and swiping to turn off the alarm works first time every time too. I am really happy with it. I did originally buy the LG to tide me over whilst I saved up and take my time to decide which phone I want next as the last few have always been bought in haste to replace a faulty one. But I think I shall keep it for a while."
"Well, I liked it fine until May 31st: got up in the morning and the screen was all vertical stripes and I could not see anything on it. Am waiting to hear back from the manufacturer.Update (15 July): I mailed the phone back to Sony on 8 June, after a ridiculous series of e-mails, in which I was eventually instructed to hook up the phone to their Experia Companion software (which wiped the phone but did not fix my problem). Received numerous requests for feedback on the repair process, beginning June 15th (they had the phone still). On June 30, I got an e-mail from Sony telling me that they had repaired the phone, but could not prove I owned it, because it was Google Locked (untrue; as I said earlier, their software had wiped the phone). Sony would not accept my Amazon order confirmation as proof of purchase (and there was no receipt in the box when the phone came). Finally, I got the bright idea to photograph the side of the OEM box, and sent them that as proof. No word back from Sony, saying that they had received my photo, or that it was acceptable for their purposes.Sony e-mailed me another request for feedback on June 16, and again on July 8th. No word on the phone.I finally called today, and, after 10 minutes on hold, someone told me that the phone was ready to ship today. (I wonder if that would have been the answer yesterday, or last week-? Wish I'd called sooner.) The phone has been in Sony Repair's hands for as much time as I've had it in mine.I liked the phone fine before it broke, but based on Sony's ""customer service"" I would not get another Sony phone. I'd give the phone 4 stars, and ""service"" negative stars. Buyer beware!"
This phone was supposed to be amazing. It's not been that for me and I have only had it since April and there is no return? It gets very hot. It just completely shut down when I plugged it in to charge at 40% and now it will not take a charge since I turned it back on... Slowly dying. It's often slow... Now what am I to do? Is there recourse? Repairs? Replacement? A different better phone? This was NOT a cheap phone. Help! If I am able to get good customer service perhaps my review will change. I'd be happy to do that. For now I am disappointed and soon to be without a phone! Bummer! What's the deal.
"Totally satisfied with this phone. Had considered an iPhone SE 6 because I wanted a smaller phone with modern specs, but glad I stumbled on this beauty instead (I'm generally turned off by Apple's closed systems, and I find Android more usable anyways. Also, I think 4.6"" is a sweet spot and 4"" probably too small).Pros:* It's the perfect size and super snappy* Camera is impressive, especially video recording* Love the button layout* Price is right* Good battery, charges quickly* Expandable storage, GSM unlocked, low on bloatware, etc.Cons:* US version fingerprint reader disabled (what's up with that?)* Screen is nice but not stunning. Bluish tint out of the box - but I was able to tweak RGB settings for better white balance* Cell-reception signal db readout seems inaccurate, but at least in a good way (even using 3rd party signal reading apps): often reports signal levels that should make reception bad or result in drop calls, but call reception is strong in reality. (note: I don't use LTE data for the most part, just old school cell phone calls / text + WiFi for data)."
"Good phone. Works well. Just a tad bit too little ram, and has an issue with Bluetooth devices."
"Upgraded from the Z3 Compact, please Sony, never stop making compact phones. I hate the bigger ones!! 720p on this screen looks crystal clear and is all you really need. It's a very powerful phone, no slow downs at all. It does get a little hot though, with a case I don't feel its heat as much. The removal of the flap that covered the USB port on the Z3 compact was a nice touch, although it does scare me that they decided to stop advertising taking it under water, not that I do that often."
This is my first Android phone having been a long-time iPhone user (since Gen 1). I found the control to be intuitive and easy to figure out. There are a ton of apps on Google Play. The phone did not have too much bloatware and much of it is removable. I suggest that any user take extra time with the phone settings as there is quite a bit of personalization that you can do.
"It is better than I thought. The battery lasts long, the pictures I take with it are wonderful, great resolution."
"Great phone! Just like all the major reviews online say, if you're into a compact Android phone that delivers, this is it! Contrary to what other reviews say, this phone does have a finger print scanner. It works very well, quick and easy to use."
Love the phone.
Phone camera quality is excellent. Size great. No issues with apps and cell phone freezing
"Very competent unit, I specially love the size and how it feels in the hand. My previous phone was a 5.1 inch unit, but somehow it just didn't feel right.I'm finding a few functions that work OK but not quite with the way I would expect, but this is more of a software issue. The hot battery hasn't been an issue with me. Overall, I'm quite happy I switched from the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. I'm now waiting in anticipation to the release of the 7.0 version (Nougat), expected as early as next month.By the way, after reading all the reviews, I congratulate myself in not buying the latest compact version, Xperia X. Most everyone says the Z5 Compact is a better phone."
"Love the size of this phone and it's definitely a powerhouse for being smaller. Camera takes amazing pictures as well. My only complaint is that this phone overheats very easily while playing games or even just checking Facebook or Snapchat. Aside from that, I would definitely recommend this phone."
"I love the hardware styling and size. Big plus for that. However, it just doesn't work effectively with Microsoft Exchange. Big lack of syncing with Contacts is unacceptable. Part of the value in being an Exchange Server user is that your email, calendar, and contacts reside there and are not dependent on your hardware for retention. But it IS dependent on your hardware for access, and this is where the Z5 Compact failed. This should be an OS problem and not associated with hardware, yet I've not had this problem with Sony phones in the past. Bottom line is I had to return it, and I hate that because I loved the phone (the actual handset). Luckily there's the newish, small iPhone SE, but that's not Android..."
"I bought the phone for it's compact size and nice camera. After playing with Android and disabling background servicing on most of my apps I did get the batter to last two days. The photos look great.However, the speaker you hold up to your ear to make a phone call failed after four months. I have not gotten it repaired even though it is under warranty because I read all the horror stories of people getting the phone back in pieces. Also, they do not make it easy to figure out how to return it.It seems like the second speaker might be starting to fail too, so at that point I will have to get it repaired."
Good smartphone.
"Every friend who owns this phone loves it, and I can now say I agree.Affordable price, normal size, 2-day battery life (longer than competing Samsungs & iPhones), 4K display for awesome photos & videos (it is Sony after all), access to all the apps you could possibly want through Google Play store, waterproof properties (without making a big deal about it like some - ahem, Samsung, ahem) this phone has it all.Minor warning: U.S. version does NOT have finger print scanning! Not an issue for me, but if you want it, order a phone from Europe! ;-)"
Great phone and I'm extremely happy with it.
overheats incredibly even with minimal usage. This is absolutely ridiculous
"First of all there are few choices in sub 5"" Android phones. And you probably already know why you use Android and won't switch to something else. So lets detail why you want this Android phone and not another:-It is very comfortable and has good weight in one hand-The call quality and microphones work really well (Okay google hotwords work with very very few failures)-The micro SD/SDXC/SDwhatever slot is a big deal. I put in a 200GB card and don't think about storage anymore.-The battery life is good enough if you have a strong data signal on Marshmallow-Marshmallow was available as soon as I turned it on. Upgrade available!-Limited skinning on the OS. Coming from a Nexus and later two Moto phones, I like stock android.-Contrary to many reviews I think the camera is excellent. When I use mine next to my wife's iPhone 6s she says my photos always look better. That may be because I switch to manual and use exposure compensation on most every image.-4K video is gorgeous and plays well on this tiny, low res screen. I was surprised it played at all.-Signal strength. I haven't dropped a call or failed a text on AT&T or T-Mo in 2 months. And my area has bad signal. Even when LTE says no bars I can get good speeds.-I think the speakers are very good for watching videos. I often run at half volume and that's enough. Little to no distortion.-Waterproof. Or is it? I showered with it and its fine. I dunked it in water. I washed it off. I dry after each time but that hot shower for the length of a YouTube video should be some kind of standard test.The not so good points I found were-Disabled fingerprint reader being that this is the US version. I use my Pebble watch as my ""trusted device"" so I don't mind this.-The screen is not as pretty as an OLED. Moto X 2013 had a 4.7"" OLED screen that I prefer to this one. Better blacks and better battery life.-The camera... I wan't a raw file format. Sony being an imaging company can do better.-The price. I guess I want better specs for this price after I've been spoiled by Motorola's deals or the Nexus phones. I haven't paid this much for a phone since my iPhone 3G S. I certainly could have gotten a Z3C for less but since my Moto X 2014 has similar specs and is struggling at times to keep up with basic apps I figured the Z3C would have similar issues. So I got the updated model.-I hear it overheats. I shot HD video for 10 minutes without issue. I charge and it gets hot but no noticeable issue. I'm no power user. I have no games installed. I cannot confirm any heat problems.Disappointing problems are-Battery life in poor signal area. I live in the suburbs and my LTE coverage is GARBAGE. Moto says 1 bar, Apple says 1 circle?, Sony says 0 bars. More on the disparity later. I would be at 20% by lunch until I made some changes. At work the battery lasted until dinner without using battery saving apps.-Doze replaced Stamina mode? With Marshmallow Stamina mode is gone (rumored to be returning as of May 2016) and the battery life is pretty bad without doing some homework. The Doze function only works if you don't jostle your phone so put it down and ignore it.-Low reported signal strength. Look up what signal db translates to bars and you'll see a -74db signal is full bars. To this phone its 0 bars.At home. At the gym -80db is full bars again. You cannot trust the signal strength meter and I can't figure out why. Neither could Sony support. So -110db should be 0 bars, -83db is full bars and you can figure out what is in between. I can't figure this one out. However, its signal (when looking at -db) is on par with the iPhone 6s and Moto X 2013 and 2014, all of which are known for having great radios.How to fix your problems:-Install Greenify, enable all the permissions it asks for and Hibernate just about everything (I think that helps). Enable agressive Doze (that really helps). Greenify will make Doze (the function not the app) useful and make that battery history graph go sideways instead of a sharp slope.-Its slippery. I knew this ahead of time and got a ""Cruzerlite Bugdroid Circuit Case Compatible for Sony Xperia Z5 Compact"" and am very happy with the grip, plus it slides less and I've had a few drops with no damage. I'm not saying its the most attractive case but I have a small phone that I'm not worried about being rough with.If I missed anything or if you have any questions, fire away. Its still not perfect but if they bring back Stamina mode I think it'll be nearly so.45 day update: I've flashed the phone three times as recommended by Sony and the forums and I can't seem to get a handle on battery life. Sometimes I'm losing 1% per minute with the phone doing nothing (Google Play Services wakelock issue) even after restarts, and some days I can get though most of the day without charging. Add to that that the 4k video function only shoots for 1-3 minutes before the camera app shuts down (@115 degrees F on the back). And Sony's response to this is give us the phone and we'll have it back in 3 weeks or so. 14 business days, 2 weeks and 4 days, is their solution. I miss Motorola's loaner phone program where they'd give you a backup until they fix your phone. Free. Performance is getting very slow and I imagine its the processor getting too hot and slowing the system down. I'm worried but too far out of warranty to get a different phone at this point. I can't tell you what TO get but I can tell you what NOT TO GET.RETURN FROM REPAIRS UPDATE: They apparently lost my phone in repair for a month. I called again and all they could say is the phone had been ""scrapped."" In their warranty they say they can return your phone in pieces and its not their problem anymore. I told Amazon and they said send us the pieces and we'll refund you. I told Sony to send me the pieces so I can be refunded and they sent a replacement phone. It seems the problems (aside from it not being water resistant) stemmed from it having Android 6.0 as it doesn't overheat and crash the camera until about 15 minutes in. Stamina mode, the thing that makes the battery so good, exists so long as I don't update the OS. It still bugs me to update to 6.0 over and over and Sony says the only way to get rid of the constant popup is to do it, therefore ruining the phone. I rooted it (to allow me to stop the Sony Update app) and it works okay but that is not a solution unless you're very tech savy. Right now Youtube stopped working since rooting and I'm diagnosing that. Of course I have no warranty now because I rooted. I still can't identify a better choice but don't get this if you want Marshmallow. Don't get this if you don't want to turn down an update multiple times a day (I read days later you can adb into the phone to stop the updater without root). Don't get this if you want a phone with a warranty or customer service. Don't get this."
It is overheated without install all apps
"I did my research before deciding on this phone, and I feel satisfied with my purchase. Some things about the user interface *could* be better, but that's true of any device, probably. Hmm... If you don't wanna be seen lugging around some ridiculously over-sized phone, well, this is the one for you. That was the *main* draw for me, although that's not all that this phone has going for it. Do your own research."
"Be forewarned. This phone, as nice as it is, heats up. Install some apps, browse some sites, and you can feel the back getting uncomfortably hot. Not scorching. You can still hold it. But it did cause some concern.Consider the Nexus 5X, instead. A little bigger, sure, but IMO it's the better buy."
"I got this phone due to the compact form factor and that it keeps as many ""flagship"" specs as possible. Battery life is not noticeable short or long and that's good enough for me. I do Clash Royale and Clash of Clans for a few hours each day on it and long stretches can make the phone hot, but not too hot to hold. Many times I'll game for 45+ mins at a time and the heat is not that bad. Camera is great! Fast autofocus and great quality for a smartphone. Placement of the physical shutter button is great if you're taking selfies...not that I do.Answer to the million dollar question... Yes, I would buy it again."
"This is a super phone in a compact form factor which the same as the new iphone is trying to do.Excellent battery and picture quality. Some people may say screen is not great, but I like it a lot. Colors are great."
Bad quality of this product.When I was talking get very hot.When trying to talk with some friends using Whatssap was impossible because an horrible noise came up!!Fortunately I get my money back because is expensive. I was willing to pay that much because I was expecting a very good quality smart phone.
"This was the ONLY viable option to replace my aging Moto X (1st Edition). I refuse to upsize to anything bigger than a 4.7"" screen. I want to be able to hold my phone and text with one (and the same) hand. Other than the older Iphones and the Moto E, nothing else fits that form factor.My Z5 Compact came with Android 5.1, but I received the Marshmallow upgrade a few weeks ago.The color is not ""black"", but more what I believe should be called ""Gun Metal Gray""The fit and finish are excellent, though the back of phone has a hard slick plastic feel, and as such I also purchased a ] because of the slippery feel to it. Mind you, I use a belt case and reach in one handed to grab my phone and use. I was used to the very ""grippy"" feel of the rubber backed Moto X I had owned for almost 2 and 1/2 years.Camera is great, but not all that important to me. It didn't take long at all to adjust to the placement of the On/Off and Volume buttons.The phone has operated flawlessy for as long as I have had it. It has snappy performance for me, I do not play games or use it for music.There are a few SONY apps that are not removable, but no where near as bad as on SAMSUNG phones."
"It's a good enough phone for all the reasons everyone else has listed. But before you buy it you should know two things.1. There is no fingerprint scanner on the US version of this phone.2. If you use T-Mobile, you will not be able to use the WiFi Calling or WiFi Texting features for which T-mobile makes themselves famous. This option is not installed on the unlocked phone (and T-Mobile doesn't sell this phone, so you're just plain out of luck). If you go to the Sony Xperia US support website, it contains instructions for how to enable WiFi calling on your Xperia, but this is misleading. Again, this phone cannot do WiFi calling."
"Update 8/8/16. Although my initial review was quite positive, that didn't last long. 3 months after purchasing, I got a teeny-tiny crack in one of the corners. A week later, the entire operating system failed. I sent to Sony Repair, received it back about a month later, With a one-sentence explanation that phone was irreparable, and not covered under the warranty. They sent me back the phone, which is useless,Other issues I found before the phone went kaput.-Glass is weak-Wifi issues galore. Not only for me, but other uses in Sony Z5 forums.-Runs hot. Another well-known issue documented.**DONT BUY THIS PHONE $400+ down the drain***I have small hands for a woman, and there isn't a lot of options out there at the moment for compact cells. For me, its major factor when purchasing a phone. Performance-wise, I have only had the Xperia Z5 Compact for a week now, but so far its been excellent! Only complaint is its availability! I waivered about buying this phone - because so far Sony only offers this phone online.. Only Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H websites. There is ZERO brick and mortar stores selling this phone. I was very hesitant to purchase an expensive phone without being able to view & try it in-person. Maybe I'm old-school, but that's how I roll :) I finally took the plunge after hearing Sony's future nextgen cells, Xa's, wont have a compact option available. No regrets on my purchase though. Superfast, and haven't run into any bugs. Upgraded itself immediately from Lollipop to Marshmellow. Battery is great compared to my old Moto X. Lasted about a day and a half with moderate use."
I accidentally broke my Z3 Compact. I bought this as a replacement. I just love the Sony feel and finish. It's fast and convenient to use outdoors since it is waterproof.
Perfect
"This phone has been the worst phone I have ever had. I got it because I don't like how other phones have been getting bigger. The first problem I had with it are that there are no flip cases for it. Fine - that is a preference I have - I get that maybe I will have to settle for the case. Then I get my sim card in it. Now it always say Cell Information as a notification (ALWAYS). I tell myself: I spent good money on this phone. It can't be that bad. I can deal with a simple notification that there is no way to get rid of.Last night was the kicker. The emergency alert system went off 4 times as I was trying to sleep. Now my phone was on vibrate with Do Not Disturb. It was so loud it woke up the neighbors. So in the middle of the night when anyone who has to work the next day should be able to rest, I was instead looking at any forum posts of how to disable it or turn it off or anything. Guess what - there is no way. I called my cell carrier. I called Sony Support. They all say the same thing. There is no way to get rid of it or to get it to be quiet.So sure - if you never go anywhere where you need your phone to be silent (the movies, an office, the doctors, a funeral) and you can let it go off whenever it wants - feel free to get this phone. I will say one thing about it - it is smaller than some out there."
"It looked excellent when I received it at the begining. However, after 3 months, the touch screen doesn't work well. And the camera runs worse and worse."
"good price, received ok."
The Xperia had a lot of complaints about how hot it gets. This was an issue before I did all the updates. So I imagine this was an issue with the original roll out. As of now I am very happy with it. The UI is very sharp and clean. I was a galaxy S3 and then S5 user. The Galaxy phones really are great but the trend toward bigger and bigger is just too much. I think the S3 dimensions were perfect but you can no longer get a galaxy at a reasonable size. So I'm making the switch and so far so good. I'll update this review in a few months. I hope in a few years when I am looking to upgrade again there are still offerings like the Sony Xperia. I'm happy to see there are good options out there.
"This is honestly a great phone. I didn't keep it but got a pretty good deal with Warehouse Deals on it, so I tried it out. Unfortunately the phone I received had some physical damage I didn't like on it, but I tested the phone anyway just to see if it was worth replacing it for another one. It runs Android Marshmallow and has a nice screen. The phone is light and has a pretty great battery which lasts a long time as far as Android phones go. The camera is just OK, and for having so many megapixels, it doesn't seem like the sensor is really that great. The phone charges quick and calls work well. The phone gets a bit too hot for my liking with the Snapdragon 810, and it comes with a lot of extra Sony bloatware which was really a turnoff. I am an iPhone user and compared this to my SE, and this phone offered me nothing outside of a bigger screen that the SE didn't already have. Before my SE I was an Android user and thought maybe I was missing out on the Z5, but after trying it, it made me miss my SE more for doing everything very very well, where the Z5 really offers a good battery and great form factor, but does everything else at an average or below-average level. I'd recommend this phone to those who want a smaller form factor, and do not want to switch to an iPhone 6s or SE, but if you are willing to jump ship, I believe Apple devices offer far better value in the ~4.6"" screen size class. If you want to stay with Android there are other phones which can offer a good value in the ~5"" arena, but far fewer that tick all the flagship boxes like the Z5 does."
my friend it loving this
"Yes the Sony Xperia z5 Compact is a great phone.I have but one complaint. The US version, which is what you're getting here, has the fingerprint scanner disabled.I can live without it, but I'd like it enabled for use."
I didn't get headphone with this phone
"Phone noticeably heats up within a few minutes of browsing, updates, etc. Such a crappy phone! Why did the company even released a defect? No wonder Sony is in the dump."
"The Battery Life is absolutely amazing! For the first time, I own a phone that I will not be plugging in every night as I crawl into bed.(Oh, and the display and performance are great as well, of course."
"Great compact phone. Wanted a smaller phone as I dislike the trend towards oversized phones which I find awkward to hold or carry around. Am not using it to watch movies or play video intensive games. Runs a little hot sometimes and camera is very good, but not great (my prior phone was a Nokia Lumia). Other than that, no complaints. Runs smoothly, with excellent web browser and no crapware to be removed. Doesn't have the UI bells and whistles of my prior Windows 10 Mobile, but at least has real apps that I can run. Battery life has been remarkable. Usage that would run my prior phone out now uses about 20% of battery. If you want a good compact phone, this is it."
"Design: Beautiful phone! Love the front and back surfaces; it's isn't cheap plastic. Easy access to the SD and SIM slots.Size: Personally, I still find this compact size still a bit big but it's manageable.Apps: Yes, all manufacturers include their own apps but the amount included isn't overwhelming. There is nothing that forces you to use use the Sony apps; I just default to Google apps; I think others may have opened up the apps. Many of the included non-sony apps could be deleted. Navigation is very smooth. Not sure what emails a previous reviewer is talking about; I didn't receive a single email from Sony.Battery life: I've used Sony's stamina mode on another Sony phone and like how this one has lots more options. For example, you can select which apps has data access while your phone is on standby. Battery life is great with basic stamina mode; it may be able to last a week. There's been complaints that the phone runs hot so that was one of my concerns about this phone but during the download/installation of all the apps I use while using GPS, the phone was barely warm to the touch.I use mine on T-Mobile's network and haven't had an issue. Places where I could previously access the network still works; places where I previously could not, I still can't."
"I really want to like this phone. It's beautiful. I can use it one handed. It fits into my front pocket. It's got a great battery life. It supposedly has an incredible camera (yet to be tested). But then I start using it... and almost immediately forget all the reasons I like it and get really angry at Sony for ruining such a beautiful phone with such crummy software.The software experience is a nightmare... the phone thermal throttles like crazy. The UI is super laggy. I've had the phone 1 day and starting the camera can take up to 15 seconds. Sony has managed to pack so much bloatware onto a phone so small that it blows my mind.While going through and trying to ""disable"" - because you can't uninstall - the garbage (e.g. augmented reality camera plugin - who the hell wants a 1980s style 3D dinosaur in their picture?), I had to stop and just contemplate that some pencil d*ck project manager approved sticking 500 useless apps - some that half-assingly replicate default Android behavior - on this phone for apparently no reason other than ""screw it.. why not?!?"". WHY SONY?! WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO US?!?I can keep going on and on.. the absolutely useless ""small apps"" that you can't completely disable.. the Sony photo album app that breaks the camera app if disabled.. there's just so much bad about the software experience that it makes me regret buying this phone.It really makes me even more sad that Sony hasn't pushed Android 6.x to this phone. It's been 6 months since Google released it.. and supposedly Sony has addressed some of the issues mentioned above in their Android 6.x OS. But for now, it's not here and all I have is this nightmare. This phone should be a no go for anyone looking for a compact phone. The software is just too bad to use on a daily basis. There's no excuse for it.Sony.. your phone is bad. And you should feel bad.** UPDATE **Feb 15: the phone is going back. Summary: beautiful phone ruined by crap software experience. For those reading the comments to this review... finding a replacement ROM and then loading on this phone is next to impossible. If you side load a ROM, you lose the DRM camera software and there's more challenges beyond that. Not worth it. Not worth it at all."
The phone does what it needs to do.
Amaaaaaaaaazzziiinnnnn little phone 📱
"I want to write an update for this phone. I now had this phone for 8 months. The marshmallow update 6.0.1 fixed all of the cons of this phone. Phone does get warm to the touch but that is during heavy usage. This happens when you spend 2 hours streaming or playing games and the battery drops down to 10%. You then plug it in to charge and resume your constant streaming and games.The phone does get slow when you have like 10 apps running at once. But that's with every phone. What I did enjoy was some photos i took underwater. See Photos. I really enjoy how it is somewhat water proof. Please know that it was under water for maybe less than 20 seconds.__________________________________________________________I just recently bought this phone 7 days ago. The shipping was prompted and the item looked well. This phone is really good but once the memory usage gets past 80 percent, it lags. If you are going to buy this phone, take out all the preinstalled app you wont be using and only install apps you will be using on a regular basis. It worked better after i got my memory uses below 70%"
"So I have been waiting for this phone to be available for a LONG time and am so glad it stands up to virtually all my expectations. If only they could have made it a LITTLE smaller!So the first thing I want to note is that this DOES indeed work with Tmobile with no manual setup or configuration - I just went into the Tmobile store, told them I have a phone I want to activate, they gave me the nano-SIM which I put in, turned the phone on and everything worked including MMS messages - super simple!I tested Internet speed while cell reception was on 2 out of 4 bars LTE, and was getting an average of 4 Mbps.Even though T-Mobile's wifi calling won't work, I just installed the updated hangouts dialer app and I'm all set to make calls when off-network and on only wifi from my free Google number.I don't have very big hands, but can still hold use this with only one hand which is my main objective, and it looks great too! Front speakers are great and you can really tell the difference in sound when you turn the phone sideways and allow your ears to pick up the stereo effect.In regards to the camera, the automatic mode is great. However the maximum advertised resolution for both the front and back cameras is only achieved in 4:3, not 16:9 to match the wide screen, though 16:9 is available with slightly smaller resolutions.Battery life is great with stamina mode - after a full day of being connected to my Bluetooth and typical handful of calls and several texts though leaving Internet off, I got home at 5:30 with still 93% remaining!No overheating issues as some have mentioned - it was barely even warm after playing a graphically intense game for over 20 minutes +Overall very happy with this phone, and I have high hopes for durability."
"works well. beautiful device. too bad Sony doesn't market it well over here in US. And also too bad it took forever to get US version. But a great Android phone, great quality. Awesome battery life!"
"It worked great for one month and since then has only been s***ier. After bad, it gets worse and worse. Among the main problems there is that keys keep being pressed while locked (for example in your pocket) so every time you need it your phone you need to go through an identification process because it thinks you have been trying to enter the passcode too many times. It is also super slow and crashes all the time. I never had a phone as bad as this one. I think its gold reviews are probably based on the initial experience which, as I said, is not bad but quickly goes downhill."
good phone
"I'm a former iPhone 5 owner and I bought this phone because I wanted an android smartphone with the same compact form factor, without sacrificing the features I'd gotten used to. The Xperia z5 compact is slightly taller and wider than the iPhone 5, but still very easy to use with one hand (the same can't be said for most other smartphones on the market!)The build quality of this phone feels great - it's got a slick glass body with a hard plastic bumper around the edge. The phone is water-resistant while still leaving the headphone and microUSB charging ports uncovered, which is a nice upgrade from the previous model (Z3 compact). Note that the phone is rated to be dust and water resistant, but not completely waterproof - Sony will not guarantee protection from activities like taking photos underwater. While I would've liked to be able to take my phone swimming with me, it's nice to know it'll hold up to rain, sweat and spills that could damage most other devices. The only flap on the phone's body covers the SIM card tray and SD card slot, but it's not a major inconvenience as you shouldn't need to access these often. It's tempting to carry this phone with no case but I'm cautious with glass-backed phones so I purchased a cheap TPU case for it in case I drop it and it hasn't been a huge compromise, it's still very pocketable. The power button, volume controls and camera button are all along the right side of the phone - another reason I like having a case on this phone is that it's possible to trigger the camera button accidentally if you aren't used to a hardware camera button.The 23 megapixel camera was one of the main selling points for me, and it's by far the best camera I've had on a smartphone! The hardware button is convenient for capturing photos quickly, although the camera interface takes a little longer to capture photos than the one built into iOS. The automatic camera settings do a decent job at capturing most photos, but if you'd like more custom options a fully manual mode is available with the swipe of a finger, along with a slew of presets for different subject matter. I replaced the stock camera app with an open source alternative because it's a little bit faster and compatible with some other apps I've installed on my phone.I've seen people complaining about bloatware, but in my experience just about every smartphone comes with some pre-installed apps. At least most of the pre-installed apps on the Xperia z5 Compact can be deleted, unlike Apple's stock apps (which I always end up putting in a folder out of my way, where they still take up precious memory). This phone comes with a generous 32gb of storage on board, but can be expanded up to an additional 200gb with a microSD card. Out of the pre-installed apps there were a few I found useful, including Sony's lifelog app, which acts as an activity counter and lets you compare your physical activity with smart detection of walking, biking or time spent in a car - as well as the activities you use your phone for, such as web browsing, gaming and listening to music. The 4.6"" 720p screen might not be the best on the market for gaming or viewing media, but the on board speakers impressed me compared to most other phones I've used, and screen size is a compromise I'm willing to make for a phone so small. Also packaged on board is Sony's Playstation remote play app, which allows Playstation 4 owners to play Playstation games on their phone. I can't speak to how well this works because I don't own the console, but I haven't experienced any lag so far playing mobile games on this phone (although the handset will heat up a little during more graphically intense titles).Overall, the Z5 compact has given me everything I want out of a smartphone during the first couple of weeks I've owned it, but I will update this review if I run into any issues. If you're looking for a small but powerful android phone that will survive daily life and occasional accidents, this is the one!"
No not really.
"good phone, I have not had a problem with heat issue. Iam very happy with purchase."
I'm happy I upgraded from Nexus 5.Waterproof and good camera will allow me to retire my Panasonic TS3. This will reduce number of devices I pack and eliminate the need for taking a TS3 picture for quality and a phone picture for public WiFi email.
"Great form factor, battery life, and performance. Kinda sucks that they dropped the magnetic charging pins from the Z3C. And it's a bit offensive that they blow away their DRM keys when you unlock the bootloader."
"Sony Xperia z5 Compact is the ONLY small size smartphone with true premium specs. It is way above and beyond the competition. I'm not going to go over phone's features in this review as they are all well discussed in many publications. I do want to comment on 3 features the phone has been critised for unfairly in my opinion: First is the price - some critics say it is too expensive. Give me a break! The phone costs $450 plus $40 you have to shell out for 128GB SD card. That is $500. Compare that to iPhone 6s or Samsung Galaxy 6s with 128GB at $850 & $900 respectively and you will realize that Sony phone is a bargain. And that is comparing apples to apples because Sony phone is surely on par features and quality wise with both Apple & Samsung. The second point of criticism is the lack of 1080p HD screen. Again give me a break! On 4.6"" screen you will NEVER notice the difference between 720 and 1080p resolution no matter how good your eyesight is. And finally the lack of fingerprint sensor on us version (it is available on the international version). In opinion of many experts in the field the fingerprint technology is not mature enough especially both security and reliability wise. Most importantly it takes me virtually the same time to unlock the phone with a 4 digit code as with a fingerprint scanner - I tested it many times on my wife's iPhone 6s. So get over it or get an international model if you can't. Thank you Sony for the awesome phone!"
great
"I really wanted to like this phone. On paper, it had all the specifications I wanted. Unfortunately the overheating issues are true. On just the setup of the phone, it started warming up and became hot to touch. I can't imagine holding this up to my face or trying to hold it for extended amounts of time. It's a bummer because I haven't found another compact phone of this size with the features this one had.If you aren't bothered by a hot phone, then this is a great phone. Otherwise this is not the phone you are looking for."
Very good everything worked as expected ! Phone was unlocked with full LTE coverage.
Gréta:)
This is our families' 5th Xperia phone. The phone itself is the very best we've owned. Only drawback is the extremely poor customer service and long repair times if service is required. Any form of repair by Sony will cost at least a month without your phone and it is impossible to contact their repair facility. Would give a five start rating to each of the Xperia phones we've owned if Sony had better repair service. I miss the magnetic charging port on previous models.
Very good phone for less money
Exactly what I was expecting.
Excellent Phone
"I purchased this phone due to the higher end specs of the phone in the smaller form factor. At first I was disappointed to learn that they removed the fingerprint reader from the power button, but I quickly got over that since I hadn't had it yet in my prior phones. Overall I enjoyed the phone at first. The form factor was good along with several other aspects. I didn't appreciate all of the Sony specific software that was on it, but I was able to overlook that for a while. Within a few months though I started having issues such as the phone running slowly, apps crashing, and the phone running hot due to apps continually running. I also had issues with connectivity with using T-Mobile and by using a phone that they're not used to it seemed to complicate things. I ended up getting a Google Pixel lately which was a huge improvement."
Excellent phone
"Great compact size phone, good battery life"
"It does get hot, but meh, get off your phone after using it. Enjoy life. It does perform really well though for games and such. Also it's a neat little phone for its size."
"This is a great phone if you're looking for the 4.7 inch range in a flagship smartphone and not wanting an iPhone! If I could, I would give this product 4.5/5 stars as that is more accurate for me.I think Sony did a great job with this phone. The camera is excellent, with my only gripe about it being that they should have spent more time optimizing it so that it launches more quickly. It still launches quickly, but it's just not quite as snappy as, say, a Galaxy S7 camera. Still quick to snap though. The dedicated camera button is also an EXCELLENT feature. Very useful for when you're trying to really get a good focus on a picture.My second gripe is that, when you connect headphones or an aux cable to this device, this little thing pops up MULTIPLE times that says ""Improve your headphone experience"" in the notifications bar. This is no big deal to me, EXCEPT for the fact that it pauses whatever video/media you're trying to play! It does this about 5 times, and then it stops. I CAN'T disable this, I have looked around for hours in settings as well as on forums. It is a bug that Sony needs to fix, and I hate it!The only other minor gripe is that the phone is just barely not as snappy as I would expect from a flagship spec'd phone such as this. What I mean by this is that sometimes apps just take a split second too long to switch between and it can be slightly annoying if I'm trying to go fast. This is a minor gripe, however, and not something that would make me reconsider my decision to purchase or recommend this phone.Overall, I really like this phone and it is so nice to be able to use it one-handed. It actually makes my job much easier if I'm using my phone while running an experiment (i.e. looking at a protocol, running a quick calculation, etc.) I purchased this phone through Amazon's warehouse deals, and while the packaging came pretty meh, the phone itself was PERFECT. Not a single flaw that I could perceive, and I got it for $100 less than retail. No warranty, but I've never needed to use it on any of the 5 cell phones I've had. It's only a 1 year warranty anymore on most phones anyway."
"great phone,no over heating problems. had the z3 phone,liked it a lot too. cracked the bace being in my rear pocket.like that this has a different back."
"This phone has many great features and was exactly the size I was looking for. I was pleased with many parts of this phone. However, hardware failures and a even worse experience with dealing with this customer service for warranty work leaves me wanting to list 0 stars. -5 stars.Within six months, the camera sensor died. Total failure. Call the warranty service department and find that I must ship the phone, at my own cost, to a service center for at least 21 businesses days. ( This means a month). When it is returned after a month, the camera works but now has a blue glow added in all pictures with a flash. Secondly, now I cannot talk on the handset because the ear speaker doesn't work anymore. Call warranty service again. They want me to pay to ship it to them for another month. I complained to manager , Cedric. He assured me that he would be personally finding me another solution within 24 hours. That was there days ago. No word, no email, no call.I owned this phone since March 2016, broke in September 2016, returned October 2016 broken, and will likely be sent back again and kept until December.They should sell this phone as a two pack because it breaks down and the service is so poor you will need to buy another phone to cover while it is being serviced.Bottom line: great phone until something breaks. And several things will. Buy anything else."
It deserves five stars
"Amazing cellphone, great seller."
"It's a great phone, but the battery doesn't last 2 days as they say, and there is no headphones in the box."
"Phone is a great sizeBeautiful displayThrow feature is awesome for connecting your phone to DLNA devices and streamingHowever, phone runs hot, battery life is nowhere near what was advertised, and the side chassis seem to be coming unglued. Sony support is absolutely useless. I'll keep my cover on and hope it doesn't fail on me"
"I used to have the European version of the phone and I really loved it. I had a problem with the camera and couldn't fix it, so I decided to get the US version because I love the compact size and the processing power that comes with it."
"It's a great phone functionally, but whatever material they use for the screen will spontaneously decide to crack on you at some point. When that crack occurs, you will lose most or all touch functionality on your phone. If the crack happens to occur after a drop, no matter how slight or soft, Sony will refuse to cover it under warranty. Essentially, Sony is under the impression that an accidental drop is automatically ""misuse,"" despite the fact that I am not aware of a single person who has never dropped a mobile phone.I could swallow Sony's miserliness if it weren't for the fact that you can't even use your phone when the screen cracks. It is not purely cosmetic. Once your phone cracks, you MUST pay for a repair or buy a new phone as you lose all touch functionality on the phone. I don't know of any other line of phones that does this and I have only ever seen this problem with the Xperia line of phones. In fact, my previous phone was an Xperia Z2 Compact and I purchased the Z5 Compact after that phone had a screen crack that caused a cascading series of problems. Suffice to say, as much as I like the Sony line of phones, I will not purchase another anytime soon.UPDATE:To add salt into the wound, Sony is currently refusing to do even out of warranty repairs, meaning I'm stuck with either a broken phone or paying $145 for a repair at a local shop that cannot maintain the IP68 standard."
Excellent!
"I've been looking for a while for a small phone with good specs. This is exactly what I was looking for. There are zero other options if you want a phone this small with decent specs, storage, and Android Marshmallow. I have big hands, but the interface is smooth and easy to use. It isn't a ""small"" screen - it's what would have been considered a normal sized screen five years ago. It's solid feeling, gets good signal strength compared to my wife's iPhone, has a good battery life (with moderate use and no daytime charging I usually have 50% battery at the end of the day). The speakers sound decent when listening to music. Not superb, but much better than a lot of other phones and tablets I've used. Very usable for watching shows or movies using the built in speakers.High temperatures fixed: When it came in the mail, it had Lollipop installed. After the setup process, it felt quite hot. However, I then immediately did the over-the-air software upgrades. There were three updates in a row: The first an upgrade to Marshmallow, and then two more incremental upgrades / bug fixes. After those upgrades, it has never gotten hot again. A little warm, but comparable to any other phone I've ever used.You can uninstall or disable most of the Sony bloatware pretty easily, with the only exception being this What's Up app that was telling me about random celebrity birthdays and crap like that in the notifications. I got it to shut up and go away by disabling its data privileges.The camera is AMAZING. There is a built-in camera button, which I love. It has a two-level press like a real camera: soft press to focus, and hard press to snap photos. I wish the lens wasn't right on the corner though - I'm always sticking my finger in front of it by accident.My primary complaint is that I wish there was a hardware button bar at the bottom, so that the buttons (back, home, etc) didn't take up screen real estate. I guess that's a minor complaint though. I'm getting used to it, and they hide during videos or gaming.Note: if you want to use OTG devices, it isn't automatic. You have pull down and hit a button to attach OTG stuff. A little annoying, but if you're plugging in wired stuff to the mirco USB plug, you're not really expecting fast convenience anyway."
nice cell phone the only details its the finger detector. doesn't work because the phone it's from the us and in that region its not compatible
"Wow, what a great phone. I've never seen such stunning video quality on the phone. Just FYI my work phone is an iphone 6s.We got this for my husband unlocked to use on Tmobile. The sound is very very clear no issues there. Reception is great. Everything is fine.The camera quality is better than any other phone i've seen. No complaints so far.The phone size is just perfect. seems like every other phone company gets bigger can't even fit in the pocket but this one does!.One thing to note, didn't realize it only uses nano sim card. One quick trip to tmobile to upgrade old sim card. They come in 3 -1 now. So you can choose your size.Sony in my opinion has the best phones out on the market. Its too bad they didnt pick up the US, but i'm so happy they sell them unlocked for all of us in the states."
Really nice phone. Meets all expectations.
"I want to love this phone, but it overheats in 15 minutes after doing practically anything.A lot of the overheating can be delayed by uninstalling or disabling the Sony bloat apps. Unfortunately, the X-Mobile display enhancement adds to the overhead and when it's turned off, causes a lot of stuttering to go away.I was ready to live with the problems because of the beautiful case and size, but it's impossible. The overheating causes stuttering in the daily use after about 10 to 15 minutes of use.I think the only thing that could save this phone is a CPU throttling, but I just don't want to do that for a phone of this expense.REVISED: I lowered the star by one due to seller concern."

As was expected although import fees are huge
I had an iphone 4 and bought the Z5 thinking that it was an easy choice because it has a great camera. My problem is with the Andriod OS. It is not nearly as intuitive and easy to use as an Apple OS. I gave it to my son and bought an iphone SE.

I upgraded from Xperia z2 to this Dual Sim z5. Im very happy with this purchase. It was a logical upgrade as most of everything is the same- however Sony has made decent upgrades. the exposed charging port is 100% better then the old hidden under a flap on the side of the phone. Also the Finger print reader works flawless and is hidden under the power button on the side. Speed and performance wise ill say the Snapdragon 810 is a mild improvement then the Snapdragon 801 in the z2. I have noticed the phone gets much warmer when i have it doing tasks such as backups or downloading larger files while doing other tasks as surfing the web. However being a water resistant phone cooling it off is as easy as running cool tap water over the front and back of the phone. Battery life has also been more or less the same. I can get a full days of use without much issueUsing the Dual sim feature is awesome as i dont need to carry 2 phones around. this phone also makes it easy to switch between sims 1 and 2 without physically handling the sim cards.
Excelent.
"I love this phone! The camera is great, the display is beautiful, very fast phone. The batter lasts one day which I think is very good considering this is a dual sim phone. I have a t-mobile sim and a movistar sim on it and it runs very smoothly. Sony did a great job with the software that manages the SIMs. The only thing I didn't like was the earplugs that it came with, but I use some noise cancelling headphones that I have instead."

So, obviously, this is a better route to obtain a Z5.Am happy with my purchase."

"The cell phone has too many flaws:1, the flash light turns on by itself.2, the phone freezes by itself.3, the phone could not be turned off many times, when I wanted to for a faster re-charge.4, the phone's ""airplane mode"" has turned on by itself quite a few times.5, when restart the phone, it would do ""update"" almost every time. That is strange: why it needs update so often? I do not understand that.6, the phone cannot get ""4G"" information.7, the USB charger cannot be used in the United States.8, the seller, Gotham's Cells, would not take it back. I had paid for US$719.98 for a ""lemon"" for three months?!I will contact Amazon.com to get it right. This deal is very rotten."

As was expected although import fees are huge
I understand it's an unlocked phone but it is a MAJOR disappointment :(I had a Sony Xperia Z3 Compact and it treated me well until the front screen shattered. I replaced it with this phone and the network keeps dropping so there's really no point to it at all unless I'm connected to wifi and everyone contacts me via facebook or google. It only happens every once in a while but it's the beginning of October (I purchased this phone in July) and if it's in my purse or on the charger for more than 2 hours the network drops and I don't have service :( As much as I would love to stay committed to Sony I don't think I'll ever consider the brand again when I replace this model (probably very soon)

Everything I was hoping for. Upgraded from the original Z which I used for over two years before the battery started to run down quicker than I liked.
Great system it beats the phone stores! It's super affordable and it looks just as nice.. I love Sony Ericsson and the store down really carry then any more.. this is my husbands and it works just as good as my Samsung 6.
"the phone arrived as expected, so far is working just fine. i love Xperia style and this phone looks and feels great"
"I love this phone very much, especially it's front & rear cameras & pictures nice & sharp. Sometimes gets a little hot on the battery depending on usage & I always have to save power & cool it down. Connects my Sony Smartwatch 2 perfectly to handle calls & messaging. This reminds of my old phones I had that used to be under the name Sony Ericsson."

Very good 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
"I have t-mobile, phone works perfect, would recommend it. I got the gold, the phone feels, looks, and performs good."
"I'm upgrading from my Xperia Z3Compact and besides the finnicky software sony provides for transferring info(doesn't work actually) the phone is otherwise outstanding. Crisp, clear display, fantastic camera, no complaints at all. Love it."
"Alright so after about a full month of using, I think I'm ready for a review now. First of all let me note that I use a E6683(Dual SIm) and its from Hong Kong. The first thing I will say is YES the LTE does work in the US, be it T-mobile or AT&T actually any GSM carrier will do.Screen• The screen is really sharp even though it's just a 1080p, thanks to it X-reality. However if you were to compare this to a Galaxy S6 or any smartphone with a AMOLED display, I would say the AMOLED does produce more vibrant color. Pixel vise I highly doubt anyone can tell the different unless you hold the very very close to your eyes (which of course, not a lot of people will do that). I do think that reading on the Z5 is more comfortable thoughSound• Sony has a lot of commercial regarding about their ""Hi-res"" music and ""Hi-res"" player and I think they are right. The stereo front speaker is nice since you will rarely block it but don't get your hope on it since its not really that loud. I mean you wouldn't want to use it as an entertain system with a lot of people anyway. Next the headphone, I've seen a lot of review saying the sound quality isn't as good as the other smartphone out there, in this case I will have to take a different ground. I own a Sony MDR-1ADAC and the sound is amazing when pair with the Z5. I tried compare with it Galaxy S6 and to me I feel like there is clearly different quality in music. On the down side, you are require to have a Hi-res music quality otherwise the quality isn't that . . . .Performance• ""SoC 810 does it overheat ?"" my answer is ""It really depend"" If you're recording a 4K video then yes it will definitely heat up but so does the other smartphone. Gaming vice I think the Z5 is doing fantastic, the Z5 can run any game so far that I tried smoothly. It does though lag sometime when it heats up (rarely, like 1% ) and has low battery mode is activate. It definitely run smoother than my HTC oneM9+ haha.• Now everyday uses such as email, texting, web surfing, all of these are buttery smooth. In fact I would say any flagship is the same in this area, unless you came from an IOS which is a lot heck smoother.Camera• That hybrid focus ! Yes it focus really fast BUT it take like a WHILE to processing the image. If you came from a Galaxy S6 or even from an Iphone 5 you will notice a substantial different in time. Iphone took a picture in like a blink of an eye, while S6 is a little slower than that but still in a blink of an eye. But for the Z5 its like 1-2 second on camera processing after picture was taken which can be huge deal if you really need to get that picture. I would say the Z5 is more like a digital camera since it be ""hit"" then done. The image quality though I would say the Z5 is better compare to the S6 or Iphone 6 but its not really a by a big margin though. Also if you really want to take a professional picture, then any smartphone wouldn't do as of now. Overall I wouldn't sacrifice the 1-2 second for a little better camera, but if you can live with that, then I would just say go ahead.• Front camera is okay but wouldn't say it's the best out there in the market compare to like a selfie centred phone. It does produce a satisfy result though.Software• If you like Stock-Android then you will probably like this too. It ran almost identical to stock android except with the small app. There's a bloatware but you can un-install it or just disable it. The finger print scanner on this phone is superb, its super and way more accurate than the Iphone 6 or even the S6 (at least to me).• This is for people who has a PS4 and want it to use for a remote play. It work technically but don't expect the same experience from the TV also a good internet connection is require to a smooth remote play too. Unless you want to connect you Z5 to a Lan cable, which work haha (I did that :D)• The battery on this phone is last longing, you can expect a whole day or more with this phone. The charging is quite slow to me though even with the Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 but maybe I was just used to a tiny battery of an Iphone 6 and S6.Phone• The phone also come with expandable storage which could give you an 32GB boost in less than $50• The water proof and dust proof thingy isn't really a big deal if you're always careful around with your phone• The strap hooker or whatever it call, to me is something I really miss. With this I can use the phone without fear of dropping, I can even take a photo without fear of dropping the phone into a river, jungle, mountain or so whatever you can name it.OverallThe phone is a premium phone if you ask me but does it worth the price, I wouldn't say it worth it to buy this phone as of now. The music quality on this phone is superb if you use a Hi-res audio and headphone. The camera is also really good but take about 1-2 second longer than the IPhone or S6 to process the image. Heating isn't something you have to worry anymore, as per gaming it will eventually heat up after a while of playing but so does every phone. Overall I would say this is a great phone, it would be perfect for me if the camera processing is at least as fast as the S6"
Everything is excellent. Display is awesome. Extraordinary camera. Sometimes gets overheated when apps stays on in background. Disappointed with the quality of handsfree comes with the phone. Very poor quality handsfree given by sony.
Excellent device. I do not regret that he had bought. Sony did not disappoint as always
Promesa cumplida por parte de Sony...
"From the stand point of design, speed, interface, photo quality, water resistant properties, and fingerprint implementation of the phone, it's an fabulous phone. The only reason I had to return the phone (and I still miss it although I only had it for a week) was that it does not connect to T-mobile's 4G LTE bands. I spoke with T-mobile and looked through various APN and Network mode settings, there was just no option for ""LTE"" connection despite the fact that it seems to have the hardware for the T-mobile's LTE bands. If any one is able to connect the Z5 to the T-Moble LTE band, let me know, I will gladly buy the phone again!"
"The Xperia Z5 is an improvement over the Xperia Z3+ with a new fingerprint sensor the phone if fast, I can go a whole day without charging it up I charged it the night before and the following night it still has power left. The camera is amazing and clear in low light and bright, but I expect improvements to come with updates, as I know they can do better on the software side, still the best camera on a phone."
Is good
"Since android 6.0 update battery does not last a full day, roughly 13-14 hours with little use, and worst of it all, the ""waterproof"" is virtually a lie, dropped in the sink, the second it touched the water, the phone immediately stopped working, now i'm out 500 dollars."
"Great phone, unique n slick... Nearly gave it a 5 star but it does heat up much quicker than any phone I have used in the past"
Amazing I love it
"It's a Flagship phone of 2015. It'll do everything and it'll do it all well. Had the Z2 and loved it, and this phone fixed all the small annoying stuff which makes it all that much better."
Really like the style and processing speed. But the screen is pretty sensitive and cracked when I tried to get something in its wedges with a fingernail.
"I am the sony fan since the sony ericsson time. I love the Z series. The first Z was the great purple color. I love purple. I bought it right away, but it does not work for my T-Mobile. And almost two month later, T-Mobile has the T-Mobile z, so I bought another one cause I need network. After that I did not change until Z3 cause I am afraid of the issue happened again. Z3 has the beautiful white, pure white. Then Z5 came, but the white one is silver. Finally I see this pink one. It looks very nice. I was worried about the network, too. But maybe because Z3 already has the set up in memory, the thing is I do not need to set up and is able to use. Really love it. I did not buy the premium because I think the size is a little bigger for me."
Excelente
A+++++++
the best phone
"I've used the cellphone 3 months and suddenly turned off after getting very hot. I've being told it's the battery and the mainboard. There's nothing I can do, and the seller is not giving me any answer. DON'T BUY HERE"
Great device.
"My phone worked well for some time and then it wouldn't stop giving trouble , i reset it and now its unresponsive and in Chinese"
"The phone look new, work great, and nice phone , But the phone is open box and poor shipping box."
HAPPY
Worked fine but had mad overheating problems and crashed. It could have been a faulty product that I got but i returned it and got the new Moto G. Return process as easy enough but it took a while.
"Great phone, does overheat. A shame that Sony hasn't marketed this in the US at all. Great battery life. Fast processor. Happy with it."
Was nice phone easy to use really very good
Great item
"I ordered a single sim version, but I got a dual version. It's still pretty nice."
Awesome phone
"I have had the phone for 1 day now, this is a quick review.Phone can go hot sometimes specially at set up when you are cramping all the apps and info from your other phone, nothing crazy about overheating like the Z3+ or the M4 which runs very hot.Camera is Great even at night on manual mode(with some light obviously)Fingerprint sensor works well, same as the Iphone 6, sometimes you will have to place your finger correctly and retry. But it works well and fast.Phone is very responsive and it comes with Quick Charger already, the entire battery can charge in about 1hr and 15 min.I do get get LTE speeds (T-mobile) on this phone mostly on band 4 in the NYC area, however instead of showing LTE is shows 4G, but this might be a configuration issue since the phone apparently is from Honk Kong or Taiwan or somewhere else in asia."
"Satisfied, everything arrived on time"
loved it
I love it
"My sister loves the phone, but it wasn't the single sim version, we recieved the DUAL SIM version of the phone. Made it difficult to do rooting."
This is my 2nd xperia. I love these phones. This phone was as expected however when I powered it up everything was in Chinese. I can't read Chinese so it was a bit of a challenge to get the language setting to English. Would have been nice if the seller let me know that beforehand. Otherwise an awesome phone.
The cellphone was dropped in water (as it is supposed to be waterproof) for some minutes and now the display stopped working.
perfecto
"I am just knowing the cellphone but i am totally satisfaced with it. That's and excelent phone, I am really happy with the ellection"
"The phone works perfectly, has everything I was looking for in a smartphone. It also arrived exactly on time and the packaging was excellent. I just love it!"
"very satisfied with the shipment, excellent product, fulfiled with published thanks"
Great product . Works as expected
Great smart phone ever.
"best phone yet from Sony of course! wonderful camera , very fluid and tastefully simple looks"
"Italian version, supposed to be fully unlocked."
"Phone looks nice and is constructed well. The screen looks good as well. However I was unable to connect to AT&T LTE or receive MMS messages, SMS were no problem. I took it into a local corporate AT&T store and after messing with the phone for about an hour to try to get it working right I was told the phone was not supported by AT&T.I scoured message boards and tried a couple things to get it working right but just decided if it won't work out of the box it is not how it is described in the product description. You shouldn't have to spend hours trying to get it to work right.Do yourself a favor and just buy a Nexus phone. It's unlocked and works right out of the box."
"First off I'm coming from a xperia z2 which died after a year of use. Did plenty of research on this smartphone and even the other flagships of Samsung, LG, HTC,etc but only this Sony phone I was satisfied with just hope it doesn't die like my z2.Pros- Camera, fingerprint, display, speed, sound, body design, fast charging.Cons- Battery dies faster than my Z2, no PS3 controller support which really is sad for me, gets a little hot.Other than that I'm satisfied with everything else. One other thing the fingerprint scanner doesn't works when your finger/scanner surface is wet."
"The battery sucks... and it sucks hard because on Z3 the stamina mode used to work pretty fine. On this model, not only it does not make any difference but also the phones last with little use a day and no more.another thing.. it gets HOT... sorry..but it does.It has some advantages, such us the charger outlet. Finally no need to have nails to remote the lid and plug it.The rest works just fine but there is nothing fancy on this new model."
"it was missing a lot of things ,the charger , the card ,and the box was open"
Arrived as expected and works perfectly fine
"Here are the problems within couple hours if buying1)slow charging time2)overheatd very quick3) its not a true black color4)front camera is ""wobbly/wavy""5)overall camera quality is bad, in all lighting6) do not buy7)couple of screen freezes8) one of my headphones wouldn't work on this"
For whatever reason i feel the Z3 is better phone than the Z5.If you go from a Z3 to this Z5 you may be slightly disappointed
It was all good yo
Tus
4week very nice. 好看不卡
Espectacular
"Great phone. Everything about this phone is perfect, for me at least. It is fast, light, and great for everything that oyu need. The only issue is how warm it can get, but it does not get as warm as other 810 SOC."
"Excellent phone, Sony always have greats phones."
"i ordered my phone from the seller Quality Deals Shopping Center ,it is taiwan version,comes with fast charger,better than HK version and China version.long time not use a sony celphone.i used Samsung galaxy note 5 s6 and edge,LG gflex 2 iphone 6 and plus nexus 6 etc.....so now sony Z5.there are so many reviews on the net about this phone,so i just wanna say somethings about my feeling.#1:the heat issue.i downloaded the game modern combate 5 with the screen on,about 2 hours to completed everything,and played it about 1 hour,the phone got warm.yes just warm,not heat at all! and nothing happened with the app.it's normal like the orthers bands.even my s6 edge got more heat than the z5 under the same use.so don't worry about this issue on z5 like z3 plus.#2:the fingerprint unlock.it is fast! more than the s6 and edge! yes i do mean it! on my s6 edge i had to wait about 1 sec to unlocked the phone,but not on z5.just like iphone,maybe faster! it won't let you down!#3:the screen,sony did the great jobs on this! it is beatiful sharp than my s6 edge with 2k screen.#4:software.it is like nexus,clean and not so much apps of sony.i am not boring yet like when i played my s6 edge.it is smooth!#5:battery.enough to one day uesd! without the stamina modo on!so i like my z5,more than the s6 and edge,maybe the note 5 will take it down for some ways.but no one is perfect,even the iphone!"
Camera is just OK. Nothing else stands out. Pricey!
device will not charge regardless of the cable used.
"Finally a phone that works without any hiccups or issues. This phone simply works. I have not had any weird issues at all with this phone, and let me tell you, that is rare. Normally I'll find one nagging problem with a phone and it'll drive me crazy until I finally cave in and decide to purchase a new phone. So far, in using my Xperia Z5, I have not run into any weird situations like that. Overall I love the form factor of the phone, and the build quality is incredible. This phone simply feels well built. There is no creaking or play on the phone. This thing was engineered flawlessly and Sony has truly done a great job. Let's look at my overall take on the phone:Screen:Recently Android phones have seen a big push for larger and larger screens, but the Z5 decided to buck that trend and not offer a bigger screen or crazy resolution. Instead, Sony stuck with a smaller screen size of 5.2"" and a resolution of 1920 x 1080. Although in a battle of specs, this sounds bad, I can say the screen looks really nice. Colors are well balanced, and I have not had any issues in the sunlight with this phone.Waterproof design:The waterproofing also hasn't let me down. Sony does not recommend submerging the phone, but I can speak from experience, this will probably not damage the phone. I don't recommend doing this for two reasons though: 1- With some bad luck, water may actually damage the phone. 2- You can't really use this phone underwater.Battery life:As a moderate user, I need a phone that can last me throughout the day. This is actually one of the reasons most phones just don't make the cut for me. This phone actually manages to do a pretty respectable job of making it through the day. Screen on time caries between 5 hours and 6 hours, but that is what I'm usually getting most days. I have the phone set up to enable Stamina Mode, which saves a lot of battery once the phone hits 50%. This is different than the normal battery saving features that most phones have. Instead, Sony disables almost all background processes and only syncs when the screen is on and the phone is ""awake."" Basically, what this does is it allows the phone to enter a hibernation mode, if you will until the next time you use the phone. Calls and texts will come in, as will many things, but emails or other programs which use data will not sync until a set interval or until the screen wakes up. Overall, the phone will easily last a whole day from 6 am until about 10-11 pm.Camera:This part is hit or miss. It really depends what you're looking for and how picky you are with cameras. As a hobby photographer, I love to have a great camera. Taking a cell phone out and knowing it'll take great photos is a must for me, and Sony really sold this phone as having one of the best cameras out there. Sadly, this is rather misleading. Does the phone take good pics? Yes. Is it one of the best cameras? No. This camera struggles in the dark. If you turn off flash and take a picture in a poorly lit room, this camera kicks up the ISO and you get a blurry, noisy mess. In daylight, the camera works flawlessly. The nice thing about the camera is that it is a wide-angle lens, so you'll get much more of the image in the frame than you will with most other phones. If you are looking for a true manual mode, this just doesn't cut it. Sony has mind-boggingly integrated a terrible UI and limited what you can do to 8 Mp. I just don't understand what they are trying to do. Set the camera to superior auto, and it jumps back up to 23 Mp and takes great pics. The thing Sony just doesn't get it I don't need them to hold my hand. Let me set the camera to manual and get creative.Call quality and speakers:Call quality is good and people have not had issues hearing me. Actually, the only time this was a problem was after I had washed the phone. Water blocks the mic and people won't hear, but then again, this makes sense and shouldn't be an issue because when was the last time you made a call underwater or being dumped water on? Speakers are not the loudest, but they work well enough. If you're looking for an extremely loud phone, this isn't it. Sometimes I have a hard time hearing Waze over the radio, but I tend to have the radio a bit too loud sometimes anyways.Overall:The camera would have to be the one biggest disappointment. I think the battery life is good, and the design and feel of the phone is great. The minimal skin that Sony puts on the Z5 is also welcome, and Sony will be updating this device to the latest version of Android, but they do take a bit. Sony tends to update most of their phones, but they do take a bit to make sure everything works. With these ideas in mind, I definitely like the phone. In typical Sony fashion, they throw a bunch of features that you may or may not want, but if you find a device that supports a feature this phone has (LDAC is a great example of this), then it simply works. No headaches, no weird set up. This is what I wanted in a phone, and I'm pleased having purchased the Xperia Z5."
this phone is very well build. it will not show LTE on the display but it as fast as lte so trust me is ok
Signal not table and fingerprints not while work compare to another phone out there
love the phone its what ive been looking for now i dotn have to worry about getting it wet.
Excellent
"It's all in the details, everything about the device is striking. It is the embodiment of Sony and grants you access to all of the Google and Sony Entertainment Network services."

"Tested with 4G of different carriers (Movistar, Claro)."
Good

I love just about everything about this phone. Except that it heats up a little bit after using it for a while.
Good
Nice phone with good camera
"Please I need some help with a BIG problem with this phone. First I don't live in USA, I live in Ecuador, I bought the phone with the help of a relative. I received the phone in perfect conditions, no problems with hardware or software. The first two weeks I enjoyed a lot the phone. But two days ago, I had a terrible issue: the phone stopped working. The screen is in black, the LED of notifications doesn't work, the phone won't turn on. I'm not a novice in this kind of things, so I tryed to turn on the device. I've tryed in three different ways: firstable I tryed to hold on the power button with the +volume button for 10 seconds and the phone is supposed to vibrate but anything happens. My second option was the little OFF button which is located near from the sim card, I read that holding on the OFF button for 10 seconds can help but again anything happens, other sources say that you have to hold on the OFF button for 120 seconds, I've tryed but again, anything.Finally I tryed with the PC Companion, but when I start the process the PC doesn't recognize the phone, and it says that I have to hold on the power button with the +volume button, but again anything happens.I didn't do anything weird with the phone, just installing the most common apps, do some calls. But the phone just stopped working. It's obvious that is not the battery, I checked it before the phone died and the battery was in 80% of charge. As you can read, I tryed a lot of things but the phone don't want to come alive again. I don't think the problem is the screen because as I said, even the LED of notifications and the vibration have gone. I'm really mad about that. I'm searching for a special center here in my town, but I want to tell you my problem. I hope that someone can help me with this. Finally I want to show you that the phone is not broken or things like that. Thank you for reading and excuse me if I did somegrammatical mistakes."
"The phone came with many apps already installed both in german and chinese (Tmobile and more). Makes you guess wether if I bought a new phone or a recicled one. Moreover, there is no warranty. And also it arrived with a very dirty packaging also in chinese.Despite that, I can say it arrived quick and has been working great, does great photos and works with 4G and 3G."
It didn't come with the headphones/earings
Best phone ever! Sony doesn't disappoint.
YesVery good device
"If you're on T-MOBILE, PLEASE READ. This phone not being set by and for T-Mobile needs to manually be updated. After setting the APN, give it a day if not sending or receiving MMS's. The fingerprint is awesome; Answering machine, yes answering machine works perfect. Other than that, no major update from the Z3 which I owned before purchasing this one."
this is better than the premium as its a perfect size for the hand. the only advantage the premium has over this model is the 4k screen which was not a priority based on cost. the phone feels solid in the hand. apart from that the xperia Z range are very hardy fones and take quite a bit of onslaught. it does what the specs say it will do. charging is fast with a 5A charger included.
works great!
"When I turned on the phone everything was in Chinese, but not sure if that is normal! be Careful what supplier you use, because I check warranty status for my phone and it does not have warranty, I didn't see what any specification like it when I did buy it!"
"Nice design and great battery life, but still have heat problem when you using video."
i didn't find the camera resolution as great as they picture it.
Received as advertised. No scratches and all.
I have problems with the signal is not. Good at all I not recommended to buy it m
Good..Thanks
"This phone was used because when I turned it on, it was one user created in some oriental language. At least its battery was used and damaged, it doesn't last more than 6 hours (even without been in constant activity) when it's suppose to last much more time as per my previous experience with sony smartphones. Totally dissapointed"
Magnific. Vanguard
I've had my Xperia z5 for almost a month now (1-21-16) and it has been working like a charm. I use T-mobile with it. I would recommend taking it to T-mobile first. However they could not get my data to work. I ended up Googling apn settings for T-mobile. Now it works perfectly.
"I ordered my phone from Cellphone Lifestyle and it arrived early and looked exactly as expected. This is to replace a T-Mobile Z3 that I dropped and broke. I very much liked the Z3 but T-Mobile no longer offers them. This new Z5 is freakin awesome I totally love it. Just a lovely and elegant design, and it's plenty speedy for whatever I use it for. I just popped in my old SIM card and it worked perfectly. Hard to imagine ever not using a Sony phone again."
"this is by far the most beautiful phone i have own , performs excellent and fast , clear voice , take the best pictures i have ever seen by any camera , feels good in hand and pocket ,display is awesome ."
"I've had my Z5 for about a week now and I am more than happy with it, lots of upgrades, the fingerprint scanner is super fast, responsive, accurate and we'll positioned; the camera is outstanding, the focus is top notch and colour representation couldn't be more accurate and stunning unlike iphone's saturated photos and the front facing captures a lot of detail, great for selfies. The ui remains simplistic and elegant which is why I prefer Sony's take on Android, very fast, no lagging at all and multi-tasking couldn't be easier, I use the little calculator a lot. The over-heating have been resolved although it does heat up a bit when running a lot of apps and from heavy usage and battery life is awesome!The design is stunning, you can see and feel it's premium and the frosted glass back is much better in terms of looks and how it feels. Only thing I did notice is that the front facing speakers on my Z5 were louder, but other than that, it's a great flagship phone, highly recommended and it's WATERPROOF! No need to wait for an alternative version like Samsung and iPhone hasn't ever had that feature so, yeah. Great job Sony."
In my opinion the best smartphone on the market.
"I bought my sony xperia Z5 in October. The device is really nice , although overheat with extended use of the camera.However the device has a serious problem ! It is presented as resistant to water, but my unit filled with water and i cant turn it on before I had to clean it in the sink. My advice, do not buy this device !!!Sony, what a shame!!!!!!!"
"great phone, update helps. fingerprint scanner is fast and works 9 out of 10 times, camera colors are reproduced but quality of pic and zoom is amazing. screen is very good and so is the battery life. charges quick with quickcharge 2.0 have dropped this phone in a glass of water and ran it under the sink many times and it works just like its advertised. the matte gold finish is amazing and doesnt attract fingerprints at all. android os is simple and works really well. front speakers are not bad, bluetooth connects really fast compared to my note 5 and iphone 6s. solid phone with quality written all over it. wish the bezels were smaller thou"
The phone is great. The only recommendation would be to set the international version to English.Packing was very good.
"Here is what I personally think of the Xperia Z5.I have to say this has to be the best phone I've ever used, the features are incredible and so is the hardware. I've been an iphone user for about 6 or 7 years, in all that time owning a galaxy s3 and having a horrible experience of it breaking the second week I had it, so to me it was too delicate and expensive. So just until a few months ago I had the ""all new"" iPhone 6 plus. Before that I had the I phone 5s and it was pretty solid and fast for the time. Well just after owning the I phone for about a month the camera stopped working so I had to send it out to Apple to get the camera fixed, turns out they sent me a new one. Well all was good for about two more months when one day I forgot my phone in my back pocket and sat down in my car and I shattered the screen and bent the thin aluminum housing.that was it after seven years it was over, it was time for something else.So on to the phone...Compared to the I phone this phone is way ahead of its league. Let me start of with what I've noticed in the week that I've owned the phone. When I go to you tube and choose the 1080p option it works flawlessly with zero buffering,as to the I phone I could never watch 1080p, it would never load. Another thing is the keyboard, it is spot on. It is rare if I ever press the wrong letter while I'm trying to type, where as the I phone I would ALWAYS press the wrong key, it was extremely frustrating. Another thing I like is the ability to choose from 8,16,20,23 mp depending on the type of picture your taking and they all come out extremely detailed. Plus the ability to record in 4K. So far I love it. I also like how everything is connected. If I set a reminder or appointment it will automatically sync with my account and I'll actually get an email. So far that's all I've discovered for now, this phone is packed full of features and options I haven't even had the time to take advantage of. All I can say is I'm more than happy I made the decision to switch and chose a great phone to replace it with."
"1. Beautiful design, looks absolutely premium.2. Camera: A huge upgrade from XPERIA Z3, I feel that it produces better photos than my LX-3 does.3. Removal of the lousy flip covers on Z3 makes the water-proof function more practical, I took it with me to Santa Monica beach and take pictures in the sea - no problem.What I don't like -1. Sometimes It can take almost 10 seconds to launch the camera.2. Battery life is not as good as Z3. My Z3 COMPACT has 70% power left after 5 p.m. and Z5 has only around 40% to 50% so it's burning almost twice of the battery.2. Overheating at the upper part of the phone (above the NFC logo), but it's acceptable as most of the time you won't be touching that area"
Great clarity for the screen - seems like 4k has arrive to cellphone.
"Phone is awesome. Seller (universal goods) was immediately responsive when I had a question and a request, after I had purchased the item. Overall, the seller was great to work with. The phone itself is super fast and easy to use. Thanks!"
Great!
excellent recommended terminal
"Amazing cam fast, i love it"
"Mine comes dual sim, the first day after upgrades, Screen turn Black and the device does not started. Now it is working fine after repair the firmware on the computer"
"Amazing, all great"
Nice phone:-)
For my friend Diego!
"Love the phone, good battery performance, so far I can say is the best one I have had."
I love sony smartphones and I love this even more and more.
"The phone I received does not turn on or charge, even after reset. I've contacted the seller and requested an exchange but has yet to respond I'm even willing to upgrade to the premium. I will be filing a claim within 24 hours for receiving a defective product. I am trying to work this out but I need communication from the seller ."
"Sony experia phone got here fast and it looks so amazing. Had to look up a YouTube video on how to change the font to English, cause it was in Japanese I think or some foreign language,but fairly enough easy to change and hella good phone. I recommend this buyer, for anyone looking to buy a smart phone."
I am totally satisfied.
"(Update review) 4 month now with the phone and i got a problem the power button stop working to wake the phone i have to use my nail because the button is stick to the phone this problem is common in this model this is a nightmare(power button stuck so is a hardware problem). I chat with sony support and they told me this phone is a hong kong version so they can't help me. (Sorry for my bad english)The phone is beautiful the feel is really premium the back of the phone is so much better, is matte so you don't have fingerprints problems anymore and is anti scratch, the sound of the speakers are really good the speakers are in the front(i like that). the sound with the earbuds are excellent Sony has his own Equalizer (in sound settings) the sound is really good with earbuds.The screen is really good but is not the best, Sony has bad viewing angle and the screen is too glossy(still is a good screen maybe in top 5 screens). i think samsung S6 have better screen and better camera. The first few days the phone is little heat in the top corner because i used a lot installing and doing updates and playing with the phone , but later days you have no problems with the heat.The battery is a beast some days i come home with 60% and the charge is so fast, Sony call it quick charge.The volume buttons are in really bad spot, sometimes i dont know if my phone is upside down because the position of the volume are in the bottom really weird, took me a week master the volume :).Sony is really late with this phone because is not better in speed screen or camera than samsung S6 is so late to the market i think carriers is Usa don't want this phone.(review date) The sim card and memory slot are really difficult to take out at the beginning you have to check youtube to do it, then is easy, i like that you don't need a pin to change sim card so when i travel i can change sim card in the plane with no problem.So why i bought this phone ? i do a lot of exercise and i always have my phone in my pocket and usually the sweat kill my camera.(that happend with my last 2 phones) this phone is waterproof so i have no problem running or Jogging or in the gym and the sound is crazy on spotify the phone is really beautiful the camera is very good the android version is good, look almost like stock android there's some apps that you can't uninstall, you have to life with those apps :( (i hate that) I know samsung S6 is $150 cheaper but for my lifestyle is better for me Z5 i am really happy with the phone. The question is: This phone is for you?Proscrazy good sound with earbudsBattery lifegood cameraexpandable memory sdfast chargingpremium look and feelwaterproofOS look and feel like stock androidConsapps you can't uninstallbad view anglesscreen to glossvolume buttons bad placeexpensive"
Great phone. Love it so much!
"Amazing camera, brilliant display, good battery life, sexy looking, super fast! Seriously a good phone!"
"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015ZLA37I?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0This phone was purchased for my son. He gave me his z3 mini since I had issues with the new phone I had just purchased. I understand android is not for everyone but he likes it.The phone is a step up from the Z3. Runs faster and holds more internally with a slightly larger screen without the thickness of the phone. The battery light is an improvement, but as with all things, it depends on how it is used. The phone does heat up quite quickly while playing games, but that's only a minor detail. All in all, a good solid phone with a fair amount of customization options and themes."
"I'm not too impressed with the phone so far. The overall design is very similar to the Z3 except for the finger print scanner which is great. I like how the charge port is on the bottom of the phone without a cover unlike the Z3's side covered port.I took my Z3 all over the world where the battery life was excellent and the signal was great. I find traveling with the Z5 to not be up to par with the Z3. I feel like I'm constantly charging the Z5 and I have a harder time acquiring service. At home (in the US) my Z3 had full bars and good 4G LTE connection all over the state. With the Z5 I only get half bars and it drops calls (not often but compared to the Z3, which didn't drop calls, it's a little annoying). With the Z3 the charge would last a full day to a day and a half. Now I have to charge twice a day with the Z5. Not all the time depending on usage, but it's obvious the charge doesn't last as long as the Z3's.Also, the Z5 seems to overheat. More so than the Z3 did. Just turning it on seems to heat the phone. I don't have my Z3 anymore so I can't compare the two.I feel like I wasted my money buying a finger print scanner. Maybe I have a defective phone? Maybe service sucks in the US because it's an Asia model? Overall, I'm not impressed."
it great but the one I get it can't connect to mobile internet.
"I am very pleased with my new phone. I was nervous, having only used an iPhone up to this point, but the Xperia app and the cord made to bridge the phones to jump info to the new Xperia made this phone a very worthy replacement for my old iPhone. I couldn't be more pleased. I haven't run down the battery yet, it handles everything I need it to do, and is a very attractive phone. The sound quality is something I was worried about -- worry not! The sound quality is every bit as good as my iPhone was, if not better. The android platform really isn't that hard to get used to on this phone either. I'm already spoiled rotten, no turning back."
"I have been using this phone for two months now.I love it a lot.The screen is beautiful.The size is perfect.The camera take amazing photos even in low light conditions.No performance issue at all with the 3gb of rams and fast processor.32gb system memory is plenty and no more headache about insufficient memory for apps and data.Plus with the sd card slot supporting 64 and 128gb cards, I can put thousands of photos and mp3s without worrying about running out of storage.Battery usage is not bad with Android 6.0.One charge can usually last me a day of regular usage in most ocassion.It only drain fast if you use the camera for hours since the photo sensor does need a lot of battery power plus you are keeping the screen on while taking photos.The fast charger comes with the phone only need less than 3 hours to get the phone fully charged.Water resistant features is a great bonus for those of us who live in Seattle.Not too many phones offer this important and overlooked feature.This phone is certainly a keeper."
As a former employee I have only used Sony products and this phone was what I expected. I have not had any problem in the two weeks that I have been using and I am really enjoying my music. I will use the camera more while on vacation this year and can update on performance later.
"Amazing phone works smoothly and takes phenomenal photographs! Great green color and beautiful screen! Doesn't have overheating issues as in previous Xperia phones :) Product arrived in excellent condition from seller. Only comment would be to have a better wall socket adapter, it doesn't stay in very well"
"Great build, feels really nice with the frosted glass, but my the camera experience is terrible and buggy and just can't compete which is a shame since Sony is the manufacture of the camera in the Iphone 6s and Galaxy s7. Silky smooth skin on android is great and the best skinned version of Android, but Sony please update your camera."

Great case
The Phone is Excelent! And exceed my expectations! Shipping on time!
"The phone is beautiful and definitely has premium look and feel. Pros - full LTE support of all US carries, water/dust proof resistant, supports SD card up-to 200Gb, excellent camera, stellar 2 days of medium battery use. Cons - I think processor is slightly lagging comparing to my year old Moto X 2nd gen. 5Ghz AC WiFi radio is not very reliable, fingerprint sensor stopped unlocking the phone occasionally and fails back to a PIN.The phone was upgraded to Android Marshmallow (6.0) after a week of use; therefore, some of the systems glitches may be attributed to the ne"
Excelente!
"I'm not sure what happened here but this was the first smartphone I purchased with this many issues. Battery was heating up during charges, would only last for 2 hrs on a full charge and that's without downloading any apps (bone stock). Would exit out of stock apps unexpectedly. Just one issue after another. Was not pleased"
Good
Loving my new so far!!! No complains!! Arrived on time
"The phone came in exactly as described (it is shipped from CA). International stock (so no instruction manual in English) and with a European plug (seller included a converter to US - thanks for being thoughtful!). The phone is perfect and was easy to set up - really not much difference to a US bought one. My old Z2 had a regular SIM card slot, so I actually had to make a trip to ATT store to get a Micro one for this phone (it's free), but everything was smooth and quick and the phone works just fine. Thanks!"
I love Sony smartphones. I have been using Sony for most of my life (except for a Galaxy note 2 for 2 years) and never been disappointed. The finger print sensor is on point. Love the design although it is a little bulkier than the Xperia Z3 that I used previously. Never the less it still feels good when handling. The Phone also works with USA T-Mobile for those who might be wondering.
"came with a power button that was falling out of place, was replaced with a new device"
Excellent product. Works in Perú. I'm really happy with this phone. Totally recommend this seller.
Camera button insensitive
The phone is good but it don't get my mobile service provider so it's not really unlocked.
"As in description, good choice."
The PHONE is CRAP THE BATTERY IS DEAD AND DOES NOT CHARGE I have it for about 2 weeks.Before it completely died It would take VERY LONG TO CHARGE NOW THAT THE BATTERY IS COMPLETLY DEAD IT DOES NOT CHARGE AT ALL A WAIST OF MY MONEY AM SO MAD !
"good waterproof phone, excellent camera, only drawback when taking video, the phone heats up to much"
I absolutely love this phone best in the world but this model should show LTE but it only shows 4G and i am very iritated by that i called tmobile and they said give it 3 days to update my imei and it will be LTE i hope so.
"great phone, but not for USA....."
Awesome phone. One of the best phones made by Sony and super stylish for girls with the pink color. Loved it
Excellent Xperia device. Sony continue to outdo themselves.
All good
Super nice phone. Especially great camera and display for the price. The PS4 remote play is cool too.
"I bought this last year, thought it was the best phone on the planet until it met 60 seconds of water. Now the mainboard is fried....."
Great Phone!!
ITS SO FAST I LOVE IT
"Love the look and feel of the phone. I love Sony phones, however this phone was shipped defective. The touch is not working properly, unable to text once phone is on for a bit, overheats, and also this phone DOES NOT work in LTE when using a Straight Talk AT&T card. Will not work in LTE no matter what APN settings you enter and straight talk confirmed this. Supplier is even requiring me to pay for return shipping on a defective product. Not at all happy with Quality Deals."
"Forget about all the reviews out there saying this phone doesn't heat up. This phone heats UP big time! Especially after using for couple of minutes (just browsing and some Apping)!!! If you run Antutu, man, you probably can fry an egg on the nice etched back glass.However, you can't really blame on Sony, it's Qualcomm SD810's fault. But again, why do you want to use SD 810, Sony??? Just use the SD808! For God's sake, use SD801, who cares about 32 or 64-bit. So, it's kind of Sony's fault.Minus b**ching about SD810, the phone itself is great!Pros:- Great screen, beautiful color, and VERY bright.- Simple and nice UX- Camera focusing is fast, but images can be noisy indoor/low light- Very premium feel, wonderful design. Thumbs up for the back etched glass... No more fingerprints all over the phone!Cons:- Heat problem. Although Sony probably set a higher temperature threshold for apps to shut down by SW, you can still feel it.- Battery life isn't that great. I have a z3, and it seems to last longer and COOLER.- Volume bottom's location is a bit awkward.- Sony, can you just hire some image processing engineers from Apple? You have great image sensors. But, man, the color of photos looks really weird sometimes. Even Samsung's photo looks better than yours on their phones... And they are using stupid AMOLED.From a super Sony fan."
Upgrading from xperia z to xperia z5 this phone is massive!!
Good for the money
"I got it without any damage in 1 week. Overall, it's a nice phone. I do not have any problems with it. Nice design as well. Like sony!"
"very disappointed to receive this phone and is not inexpensive and it is visible that was used, the phone back has an scratch the box does not looks new the film over the face of the phone has being removed before. returned for full credit"
I absolutely love this phone. Came when expected and exactly like it was described.
Took a while but excelent product

the battery life not the same
works great!
"When I turned on the phone everything was in Chinese, but not sure if that is normal! be Careful what supplier you use, because I check warranty status for my phone and it does not have warranty, I didn't see what any specification like it when I did buy it!"
"Nice design and great battery life, but still have heat problem when you using video."
i didn't find the camera resolution as great as they picture it.
Received as advertised. No scratches and all.
I have problems with the signal is not. Good at all I not recommended to buy it m
Good..Thanks
"This phone was used because when I turned it on, it was one user created in some oriental language. At least its battery was used and damaged, it doesn't last more than 6 hours (even without been in constant activity) when it's suppose to last much more time as per my previous experience with sony smartphones. Totally dissapointed"
Magnific. Vanguard
Sony quality is very good.
"Satisfied, everything arrived on time"
loved it
I love it
"My sister loves the phone, but it wasn't the single sim version, we recieved the DUAL SIM version of the phone. Made it difficult to do rooting."
This is my 2nd xperia. I love these phones. This phone was as expected however when I powered it up everything was in Chinese. I can't read Chinese so it was a bit of a challenge to get the language setting to English. Would have been nice if the seller let me know that beforehand. Otherwise an awesome phone.
The cellphone was dropped in water (as it is supposed to be waterproof) for some minutes and now the display stopped working.
perfecto
"I am just knowing the cellphone but i am totally satisfaced with it. That's and excelent phone, I am really happy with the ellection"
"The phone works perfectly, has everything I was looking for in a smartphone. It also arrived exactly on time and the packaging was excellent. I just love it!"
I've had my Xperia z5 for almost a month now (1-21-16) and it has been working like a charm. I use T-mobile with it. I would recommend taking it to T-mobile first. However they could not get my data to work. I ended up Googling apn settings for T-mobile. Now it works perfectly.

Great clarity for the screen - seems like 4k has arrive to cellphone.
"I have had the phone for 1 day now, this is a quick review.Phone can go hot sometimes specially at set up when you are cramping all the apps and info from your other phone, nothing crazy about overheating like the Z3+ or the M4 which runs very hot.Camera is Great even at night on manual mode(with some light obviously)Fingerprint sensor works well, same as the Iphone 6, sometimes you will have to place your finger correctly and retry. But it works well and fast.Phone is very responsive and it comes with Quick Charger already, the entire battery can charge in about 1hr and 15 min.I do get get LTE speeds (T-mobile) on this phone mostly on band 4 in the NYC area, however instead of showing LTE is shows 4G, but this might be a configuration issue since the phone apparently is from Honk Kong or Taiwan or somewhere else in asia."
"Here are the problems within couple hours if buying1)slow charging time2)overheatd very quick3) its not a true black color4)front camera is ""wobbly/wavy""5)overall camera quality is bad, in all lighting6) do not buy7)couple of screen freezes8) one of my headphones wouldn't work on this"

Absolutely awesome! Thank you Sony.
Very good 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
"I have t-mobile, phone works perfect, would recommend it. I got the gold, the phone feels, looks, and performs good."
"I'm upgrading from my Xperia Z3Compact and besides the finnicky software sony provides for transferring info(doesn't work actually) the phone is otherwise outstanding. Crisp, clear display, fantastic camera, no complaints at all. Love it."
"Alright so after about a full month of using, I think I'm ready for a review now. First of all let me note that I use a E6683(Dual SIm) and its from Hong Kong. The first thing I will say is YES the LTE does work in the US, be it T-mobile or AT&T actually any GSM carrier will do.Screen• The screen is really sharp even though it's just a 1080p, thanks to it X-reality. However if you were to compare this to a Galaxy S6 or any smartphone with a AMOLED display, I would say the AMOLED does produce more vibrant color. Pixel vise I highly doubt anyone can tell the different unless you hold the very very close to your eyes (which of course, not a lot of people will do that). I do think that reading on the Z5 is more comfortable thoughSound• Sony has a lot of commercial regarding about their ""Hi-res"" music and ""Hi-res"" player and I think they are right. The stereo front speaker is nice since you will rarely block it but don't get your hope on it since its not really that loud. I mean you wouldn't want to use it as an entertain system with a lot of people anyway. Next the headphone, I've seen a lot of review saying the sound quality isn't as good as the other smartphone out there, in this case I will have to take a different ground. I own a Sony MDR-1ADAC and the sound is amazing when pair with the Z5. I tried compare with it Galaxy S6 and to me I feel like there is clearly different quality in music. On the down side, you are require to have a Hi-res music quality otherwise the quality isn't that . . . .Performance• ""SoC 810 does it overheat ?"" my answer is ""It really depend"" If you're recording a 4K video then yes it will definitely heat up but so does the other smartphone. Gaming vice I think the Z5 is doing fantastic, the Z5 can run any game so far that I tried smoothly. It does though lag sometime when it heats up (rarely, like 1% ) and has low battery mode is activate. It definitely run smoother than my HTC oneM9+ haha.• Now everyday uses such as email, texting, web surfing, all of these are buttery smooth. In fact I would say any flagship is the same in this area, unless you came from an IOS which is a lot heck smoother.Camera• That hybrid focus ! Yes it focus really fast BUT it take like a WHILE to processing the image. If you came from a Galaxy S6 or even from an Iphone 5 you will notice a substantial different in time. Iphone took a picture in like a blink of an eye, while S6 is a little slower than that but still in a blink of an eye. But for the Z5 its like 1-2 second on camera processing after picture was taken which can be huge deal if you really need to get that picture. I would say the Z5 is more like a digital camera since it be ""hit"" then done. The image quality though I would say the Z5 is better compare to the S6 or Iphone 6 but its not really a by a big margin though. Also if you really want to take a professional picture, then any smartphone wouldn't do as of now. Overall I wouldn't sacrifice the 1-2 second for a little better camera, but if you can live with that, then I would just say go ahead.• Front camera is okay but wouldn't say it's the best out there in the market compare to like a selfie centred phone. It does produce a satisfy result though.Software• If you like Stock-Android then you will probably like this too. It ran almost identical to stock android except with the small app. There's a bloatware but you can un-install it or just disable it. The finger print scanner on this phone is superb, its super and way more accurate than the Iphone 6 or even the S6 (at least to me).• This is for people who has a PS4 and want it to use for a remote play. It work technically but don't expect the same experience from the TV also a good internet connection is require to a smooth remote play too. Unless you want to connect you Z5 to a Lan cable, which work haha (I did that :D)• The battery on this phone is last longing, you can expect a whole day or more with this phone. The charging is quite slow to me though even with the Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 but maybe I was just used to a tiny battery of an Iphone 6 and S6.Phone• The phone also come with expandable storage which could give you an 32GB boost in less than $50• The water proof and dust proof thingy isn't really a big deal if you're always careful around with your phone• The strap hooker or whatever it call, to me is something I really miss. With this I can use the phone without fear of dropping, I can even take a photo without fear of dropping the phone into a river, jungle, mountain or so whatever you can name it.OverallThe phone is a premium phone if you ask me but does it worth the price, I wouldn't say it worth it to buy this phone as of now. The music quality on this phone is superb if you use a Hi-res audio and headphone. The camera is also really good but take about 1-2 second longer than the IPhone or S6 to process the image. Heating isn't something you have to worry anymore, as per gaming it will eventually heat up after a while of playing but so does every phone. Overall I would say this is a great phone, it would be perfect for me if the camera processing is at least as fast as the S6"
Everything is excellent. Display is awesome. Extraordinary camera. Sometimes gets overheated when apps stays on in background. Disappointed with the quality of handsfree comes with the phone. Very poor quality handsfree given by sony.
Excellent device. I do not regret that he had bought. Sony did not disappoint as always
Promesa cumplida por parte de Sony...
"From the stand point of design, speed, interface, photo quality, water resistant properties, and fingerprint implementation of the phone, it's an fabulous phone. The only reason I had to return the phone (and I still miss it although I only had it for a week) was that it does not connect to T-mobile's 4G LTE bands. I spoke with T-mobile and looked through various APN and Network mode settings, there was just no option for ""LTE"" connection despite the fact that it seems to have the hardware for the T-mobile's LTE bands. If any one is able to connect the Z5 to the T-Moble LTE band, let me know, I will gladly buy the phone again!"
"The Xperia Z5 is an improvement over the Xperia Z3+ with a new fingerprint sensor the phone if fast, I can go a whole day without charging it up I charged it the night before and the following night it still has power left. The camera is amazing and clear in low light and bright, but I expect improvements to come with updates, as I know they can do better on the software side, still the best camera on a phone."
"very satisfied with the shipment, excellent product, fulfiled with published thanks"
Great device.
"My phone worked well for some time and then it wouldn't stop giving trouble , i reset it and now its unresponsive and in Chinese"
"The phone look new, work great, and nice phone , But the phone is open box and poor shipping box."
HAPPY
Worked fine but had mad overheating problems and crashed. It could have been a faulty product that I got but i returned it and got the new Moto G. Return process as easy enough but it took a while.
"Great phone, does overheat. A shame that Sony hasn't marketed this in the US at all. Great battery life. Fast processor. Happy with it."
Was nice phone easy to use really very good
Great item
"I ordered a single sim version, but I got a dual version. It's still pretty nice."
"I ordered my phone from Cellphone Lifestyle and it arrived early and looked exactly as expected. This is to replace a T-Mobile Z3 that I dropped and broke. I very much liked the Z3 but T-Mobile no longer offers them. This new Z5 is freakin awesome I totally love it. Just a lovely and elegant design, and it's plenty speedy for whatever I use it for. I just popped in my old SIM card and it worked perfectly. Hard to imagine ever not using a Sony phone again."
"this is by far the most beautiful phone i have own , performs excellent and fast , clear voice , take the best pictures i have ever seen by any camera , feels good in hand and pocket ,display is awesome ."
"I've had my Z5 for about a week now and I am more than happy with it, lots of upgrades, the fingerprint scanner is super fast, responsive, accurate and we'll positioned; the camera is outstanding, the focus is top notch and colour representation couldn't be more accurate and stunning unlike iphone's saturated photos and the front facing captures a lot of detail, great for selfies. The ui remains simplistic and elegant which is why I prefer Sony's take on Android, very fast, no lagging at all and multi-tasking couldn't be easier, I use the little calculator a lot. The over-heating have been resolved although it does heat up a bit when running a lot of apps and from heavy usage and battery life is awesome!The design is stunning, you can see and feel it's premium and the frosted glass back is much better in terms of looks and how it feels. Only thing I did notice is that the front facing speakers on my Z5 were louder, but other than that, it's a great flagship phone, highly recommended and it's WATERPROOF! No need to wait for an alternative version like Samsung and iPhone hasn't ever had that feature so, yeah. Great job Sony."
In my opinion the best smartphone on the market.
"I bought my sony xperia Z5 in October. The device is really nice , although overheat with extended use of the camera.However the device has a serious problem ! It is presented as resistant to water, but my unit filled with water and i cant turn it on before I had to clean it in the sink. My advice, do not buy this device !!!Sony, what a shame!!!!!!!"
"great phone, update helps. fingerprint scanner is fast and works 9 out of 10 times, camera colors are reproduced but quality of pic and zoom is amazing. screen is very good and so is the battery life. charges quick with quickcharge 2.0 have dropped this phone in a glass of water and ran it under the sink many times and it works just like its advertised. the matte gold finish is amazing and doesnt attract fingerprints at all. android os is simple and works really well. front speakers are not bad, bluetooth connects really fast compared to my note 5 and iphone 6s. solid phone with quality written all over it. wish the bezels were smaller thou"
The phone is great. The only recommendation would be to set the international version to English.Packing was very good.
"Here is what I personally think of the Xperia Z5.I have to say this has to be the best phone I've ever used, the features are incredible and so is the hardware. I've been an iphone user for about 6 or 7 years, in all that time owning a galaxy s3 and having a horrible experience of it breaking the second week I had it, so to me it was too delicate and expensive. So just until a few months ago I had the ""all new"" iPhone 6 plus. Before that I had the I phone 5s and it was pretty solid and fast for the time. Well just after owning the I phone for about a month the camera stopped working so I had to send it out to Apple to get the camera fixed, turns out they sent me a new one. Well all was good for about two more months when one day I forgot my phone in my back pocket and sat down in my car and I shattered the screen and bent the thin aluminum housing.that was it after seven years it was over, it was time for something else.So on to the phone...Compared to the I phone this phone is way ahead of its league. Let me start of with what I've noticed in the week that I've owned the phone. When I go to you tube and choose the 1080p option it works flawlessly with zero buffering,as to the I phone I could never watch 1080p, it would never load. Another thing is the keyboard, it is spot on. It is rare if I ever press the wrong letter while I'm trying to type, where as the I phone I would ALWAYS press the wrong key, it was extremely frustrating. Another thing I like is the ability to choose from 8,16,20,23 mp depending on the type of picture your taking and they all come out extremely detailed. Plus the ability to record in 4K. So far I love it. I also like how everything is connected. If I set a reminder or appointment it will automatically sync with my account and I'll actually get an email. So far that's all I've discovered for now, this phone is packed full of features and options I haven't even had the time to take advantage of. All I can say is I'm more than happy I made the decision to switch and chose a great phone to replace it with."
"1. Beautiful design, looks absolutely premium.2. Camera: A huge upgrade from XPERIA Z3, I feel that it produces better photos than my LX-3 does.3. Removal of the lousy flip covers on Z3 makes the water-proof function more practical, I took it with me to Santa Monica beach and take pictures in the sea - no problem.What I don't like -1. Sometimes It can take almost 10 seconds to launch the camera.2. Battery life is not as good as Z3. My Z3 COMPACT has 70% power left after 5 p.m. and Z5 has only around 40% to 50% so it's burning almost twice of the battery.2. Overheating at the upper part of the phone (above the NFC logo), but it's acceptable as most of the time you won't be touching that area"
Great clarity for the screen - seems like 4k has arrive to cellphone.
I love just about everything about this phone. Except that it heats up a little bit after using it for a while.
Good
Nice phone with good camera
"Please I need some help with a BIG problem with this phone. First I don't live in USA, I live in Ecuador, I bought the phone with the help of a relative. I received the phone in perfect conditions, no problems with hardware or software. The first two weeks I enjoyed a lot the phone. But two days ago, I had a terrible issue: the phone stopped working. The screen is in black, the LED of notifications doesn't work, the phone won't turn on. I'm not a novice in this kind of things, so I tryed to turn on the device. I've tryed in three different ways: firstable I tryed to hold on the power button with the +volume button for 10 seconds and the phone is supposed to vibrate but anything happens. My second option was the little OFF button which is located near from the sim card, I read that holding on the OFF button for 10 seconds can help but again anything happens, other sources say that you have to hold on the OFF button for 120 seconds, I've tryed but again, anything.Finally I tryed with the PC Companion, but when I start the process the PC doesn't recognize the phone, and it says that I have to hold on the power button with the +volume button, but again anything happens.I didn't do anything weird with the phone, just installing the most common apps, do some calls. But the phone just stopped working. It's obvious that is not the battery, I checked it before the phone died and the battery was in 80% of charge. As you can read, I tryed a lot of things but the phone don't want to come alive again. I don't think the problem is the screen because as I said, even the LED of notifications and the vibration have gone. I'm really mad about that. I'm searching for a special center here in my town, but I want to tell you my problem. I hope that someone can help me with this. Finally I want to show you that the phone is not broken or things like that. Thank you for reading and excuse me if I did somegrammatical mistakes."
"The phone came with many apps already installed both in german and chinese (Tmobile and more). Makes you guess wether if I bought a new phone or a recicled one. Moreover, there is no warranty. And also it arrived with a very dirty packaging also in chinese.Despite that, I can say it arrived quick and has been working great, does great photos and works with 4G and 3G."
It didn't come with the headphones/earings
Best phone ever! Sony doesn't disappoint.
YesVery good device
"If you're on T-MOBILE, PLEASE READ. This phone not being set by and for T-Mobile needs to manually be updated. After setting the APN, give it a day if not sending or receiving MMS's. The fingerprint is awesome; Answering machine, yes answering machine works perfect. Other than that, no major update from the Z3 which I owned before purchasing this one."
this is better than the premium as its a perfect size for the hand. the only advantage the premium has over this model is the 4k screen which was not a priority based on cost. the phone feels solid in the hand. apart from that the xperia Z range are very hardy fones and take quite a bit of onslaught. it does what the specs say it will do. charging is fast with a 5A charger included.
"Finally a phone that works without any hiccups or issues. This phone simply works. I have not had any weird issues at all with this phone, and let me tell you, that is rare. Normally I'll find one nagging problem with a phone and it'll drive me crazy until I finally cave in and decide to purchase a new phone. So far, in using my Xperia Z5, I have not run into any weird situations like that. Overall I love the form factor of the phone, and the build quality is incredible. This phone simply feels well built. There is no creaking or play on the phone. This thing was engineered flawlessly and Sony has truly done a great job. Let's look at my overall take on the phone:Screen:Recently Android phones have seen a big push for larger and larger screens, but the Z5 decided to buck that trend and not offer a bigger screen or crazy resolution. Instead, Sony stuck with a smaller screen size of 5.2"" and a resolution of 1920 x 1080. Although in a battle of specs, this sounds bad, I can say the screen looks really nice. Colors are well balanced, and I have not had any issues in the sunlight with this phone.Waterproof design:The waterproofing also hasn't let me down. Sony does not recommend submerging the phone, but I can speak from experience, this will probably not damage the phone. I don't recommend doing this for two reasons though: 1- With some bad luck, water may actually damage the phone. 2- You can't really use this phone underwater.Battery life:As a moderate user, I need a phone that can last me throughout the day. This is actually one of the reasons most phones just don't make the cut for me. This phone actually manages to do a pretty respectable job of making it through the day. Screen on time caries between 5 hours and 6 hours, but that is what I'm usually getting most days. I have the phone set up to enable Stamina Mode, which saves a lot of battery once the phone hits 50%. This is different than the normal battery saving features that most phones have. Instead, Sony disables almost all background processes and only syncs when the screen is on and the phone is ""awake."" Basically, what this does is it allows the phone to enter a hibernation mode, if you will until the next time you use the phone. Calls and texts will come in, as will many things, but emails or other programs which use data will not sync until a set interval or until the screen wakes up. Overall, the phone will easily last a whole day from 6 am until about 10-11 pm.Camera:This part is hit or miss. It really depends what you're looking for and how picky you are with cameras. As a hobby photographer, I love to have a great camera. Taking a cell phone out and knowing it'll take great photos is a must for me, and Sony really sold this phone as having one of the best cameras out there. Sadly, this is rather misleading. Does the phone take good pics? Yes. Is it one of the best cameras? No. This camera struggles in the dark. If you turn off flash and take a picture in a poorly lit room, this camera kicks up the ISO and you get a blurry, noisy mess. In daylight, the camera works flawlessly. The nice thing about the camera is that it is a wide-angle lens, so you'll get much more of the image in the frame than you will with most other phones. If you are looking for a true manual mode, this just doesn't cut it. Sony has mind-boggingly integrated a terrible UI and limited what you can do to 8 Mp. I just don't understand what they are trying to do. Set the camera to superior auto, and it jumps back up to 23 Mp and takes great pics. The thing Sony just doesn't get it I don't need them to hold my hand. Let me set the camera to manual and get creative.Call quality and speakers:Call quality is good and people have not had issues hearing me. Actually, the only time this was a problem was after I had washed the phone. Water blocks the mic and people won't hear, but then again, this makes sense and shouldn't be an issue because when was the last time you made a call underwater or being dumped water on? Speakers are not the loudest, but they work well enough. If you're looking for an extremely loud phone, this isn't it. Sometimes I have a hard time hearing Waze over the radio, but I tend to have the radio a bit too loud sometimes anyways.Overall:The camera would have to be the one biggest disappointment. I think the battery life is good, and the design and feel of the phone is great. The minimal skin that Sony puts on the Z5 is also welcome, and Sony will be updating this device to the latest version of Android, but they do take a bit. Sony tends to update most of their phones, but they do take a bit to make sure everything works. With these ideas in mind, I definitely like the phone. In typical Sony fashion, they throw a bunch of features that you may or may not want, but if you find a device that supports a feature this phone has (LDAC is a great example of this), then it simply works. No headaches, no weird set up. This is what I wanted in a phone, and I'm pleased having purchased the Xperia Z5."
this phone is very well build. it will not show LTE on the display but it as fast as lte so trust me is ok
Signal not table and fingerprints not while work compare to another phone out there
love the phone its what ive been looking for now i dotn have to worry about getting it wet.
Excellent
"It's all in the details, everything about the device is striking. It is the embodiment of Sony and grants you access to all of the Google and Sony Entertainment Network services."
Today i jzt take a pic with the Phone trying for the first time the Watter resistence and is totally fake so if u r looking for a Phone that can do this keep looking My Phone gets crazy and lost the volume and the sneaker also the screen Was damageI purchased this in february so i have no longer garanty but i think this post Will help to futures owners
"Tested with 4G of different carriers (Movistar, Claro)."
Good
the battery life not the same
Great product . Works as expected
Great smart phone ever.
"best phone yet from Sony of course! wonderful camera , very fluid and tastefully simple looks"
"Italian version, supposed to be fully unlocked."
"Phone looks nice and is constructed well. The screen looks good as well. However I was unable to connect to AT&T LTE or receive MMS messages, SMS were no problem. I took it into a local corporate AT&T store and after messing with the phone for about an hour to try to get it working right I was told the phone was not supported by AT&T.I scoured message boards and tried a couple things to get it working right but just decided if it won't work out of the box it is not how it is described in the product description. You shouldn't have to spend hours trying to get it to work right.Do yourself a favor and just buy a Nexus phone. It's unlocked and works right out of the box."
"First off I'm coming from a xperia z2 which died after a year of use. Did plenty of research on this smartphone and even the other flagships of Samsung, LG, HTC,etc but only this Sony phone I was satisfied with just hope it doesn't die like my z2.Pros- Camera, fingerprint, display, speed, sound, body design, fast charging.Cons- Battery dies faster than my Z2, no PS3 controller support which really is sad for me, gets a little hot.Other than that I'm satisfied with everything else. One other thing the fingerprint scanner doesn't works when your finger/scanner surface is wet."
"The battery sucks... and it sucks hard because on Z3 the stamina mode used to work pretty fine. On this model, not only it does not make any difference but also the phones last with little use a day and no more.another thing.. it gets HOT... sorry..but it does.It has some advantages, such us the charger outlet. Finally no need to have nails to remote the lid and plug it.The rest works just fine but there is nothing fancy on this new model."
"it was missing a lot of things ,the charger , the card ,and the box was open"
Arrived as expected and works perfectly fine
"Here are the problems within couple hours if buying1)slow charging time2)overheatd very quick3) its not a true black color4)front camera is ""wobbly/wavy""5)overall camera quality is bad, in all lighting6) do not buy7)couple of screen freezes8) one of my headphones wouldn't work on this"
"I have been using this phone for two months now.I love it a lot.The screen is beautiful.The size is perfect.The camera take amazing photos even in low light conditions.No performance issue at all with the 3gb of rams and fast processor.32gb system memory is plenty and no more headache about insufficient memory for apps and data.Plus with the sd card slot supporting 64 and 128gb cards, I can put thousands of photos and mp3s without worrying about running out of storage.Battery usage is not bad with Android 6.0.One charge can usually last me a day of regular usage in most ocassion.It only drain fast if you use the camera for hours since the photo sensor does need a lot of battery power plus you are keeping the screen on while taking photos.The fast charger comes with the phone only need less than 3 hours to get the phone fully charged.Water resistant features is a great bonus for those of us who live in Seattle.Not too many phones offer this important and overlooked feature.This phone is certainly a keeper."
As a former employee I have only used Sony products and this phone was what I expected. I have not had any problem in the two weeks that I have been using and I am really enjoying my music. I will use the camera more while on vacation this year and can update on performance later.
"Amazing phone works smoothly and takes phenomenal photographs! Great green color and beautiful screen! Doesn't have overheating issues as in previous Xperia phones :) Product arrived in excellent condition from seller. Only comment would be to have a better wall socket adapter, it doesn't stay in very well"
"Great build, feels really nice with the frosted glass, but my the camera experience is terrible and buggy and just can't compete which is a shame since Sony is the manufacture of the camera in the Iphone 6s and Galaxy s7. Silky smooth skin on android is great and the best skinned version of Android, but Sony please update your camera."

Great case
The Phone is Excelent! And exceed my expectations! Shipping on time!
"The phone is beautiful and definitely has premium look and feel. Pros - full LTE support of all US carries, water/dust proof resistant, supports SD card up-to 200Gb, excellent camera, stellar 2 days of medium battery use. Cons - I think processor is slightly lagging comparing to my year old Moto X 2nd gen. 5Ghz AC WiFi radio is not very reliable, fingerprint sensor stopped unlocking the phone occasionally and fails back to a PIN.The phone was upgraded to Android Marshmallow (6.0) after a week of use; therefore, some of the systems glitches may be attributed to the ne"
Excelente!
"I'm not sure what happened here but this was the first smartphone I purchased with this many issues. Battery was heating up during charges, would only last for 2 hrs on a full charge and that's without downloading any apps (bone stock). Would exit out of stock apps unexpectedly. Just one issue after another. Was not pleased"
For whatever reason i feel the Z3 is better phone than the Z5.If you go from a Z3 to this Z5 you may be slightly disappointed
It was all good yo
Tus
4week very nice. 好看不卡
Espectacular
"Great phone. Everything about this phone is perfect, for me at least. It is fast, light, and great for everything that oyu need. The only issue is how warm it can get, but it does not get as warm as other 810 SOC."
"Excellent phone, Sony always have greats phones."
"i ordered my phone from the seller Quality Deals Shopping Center ,it is taiwan version,comes with fast charger,better than HK version and China version.long time not use a sony celphone.i used Samsung galaxy note 5 s6 and edge,LG gflex 2 iphone 6 and plus nexus 6 etc.....so now sony Z5.there are so many reviews on the net about this phone,so i just wanna say somethings about my feeling.#1:the heat issue.i downloaded the game modern combate 5 with the screen on,about 2 hours to completed everything,and played it about 1 hour,the phone got warm.yes just warm,not heat at all! and nothing happened with the app.it's normal like the orthers bands.even my s6 edge got more heat than the z5 under the same use.so don't worry about this issue on z5 like z3 plus.#2:the fingerprint unlock.it is fast! more than the s6 and edge! yes i do mean it! on my s6 edge i had to wait about 1 sec to unlocked the phone,but not on z5.just like iphone,maybe faster! it won't let you down!#3:the screen,sony did the great jobs on this! it is beatiful sharp than my s6 edge with 2k screen.#4:software.it is like nexus,clean and not so much apps of sony.i am not boring yet like when i played my s6 edge.it is smooth!#5:battery.enough to one day uesd! without the stamina modo on!so i like my z5,more than the s6 and edge,maybe the note 5 will take it down for some ways.but no one is perfect,even the iphone!"
Camera is just OK. Nothing else stands out. Pricey!
device will not charge regardless of the cable used.
"The phone I received does not turn on or charge, even after reset. I've contacted the seller and requested an exchange but has yet to respond I'm even willing to upgrade to the premium. I will be filing a claim within 24 hours for receiving a defective product. I am trying to work this out but I need communication from the seller ."
"Sony experia phone got here fast and it looks so amazing. Had to look up a YouTube video on how to change the font to English, cause it was in Japanese I think or some foreign language,but fairly enough easy to change and hella good phone. I recommend this buyer, for anyone looking to buy a smart phone."
I am totally satisfied.
"(Update review) 4 month now with the phone and i got a problem the power button stop working to wake the phone i have to use my nail because the button is stick to the phone this problem is common in this model this is a nightmare(power button stuck so is a hardware problem). I chat with sony support and they told me this phone is a hong kong version so they can't help me. (Sorry for my bad english)The phone is beautiful the feel is really premium the back of the phone is so much better, is matte so you don't have fingerprints problems anymore and is anti scratch, the sound of the speakers are really good the speakers are in the front(i like that). the sound with the earbuds are excellent Sony has his own Equalizer (in sound settings) the sound is really good with earbuds.The screen is really good but is not the best, Sony has bad viewing angle and the screen is too glossy(still is a good screen maybe in top 5 screens). i think samsung S6 have better screen and better camera. The first few days the phone is little heat in the top corner because i used a lot installing and doing updates and playing with the phone , but later days you have no problems with the heat.The battery is a beast some days i come home with 60% and the charge is so fast, Sony call it quick charge.The volume buttons are in really bad spot, sometimes i dont know if my phone is upside down because the position of the volume are in the bottom really weird, took me a week master the volume :).Sony is really late with this phone because is not better in speed screen or camera than samsung S6 is so late to the market i think carriers is Usa don't want this phone.(review date) The sim card and memory slot are really difficult to take out at the beginning you have to check youtube to do it, then is easy, i like that you don't need a pin to change sim card so when i travel i can change sim card in the plane with no problem.So why i bought this phone ? i do a lot of exercise and i always have my phone in my pocket and usually the sweat kill my camera.(that happend with my last 2 phones) this phone is waterproof so i have no problem running or Jogging or in the gym and the sound is crazy on spotify the phone is really beautiful the camera is very good the android version is good, look almost like stock android there's some apps that you can't uninstall, you have to life with those apps :( (i hate that) I know samsung S6 is $150 cheaper but for my lifestyle is better for me Z5 i am really happy with the phone. The question is: This phone is for you?Proscrazy good sound with earbudsBattery lifegood cameraexpandable memory sdfast chargingpremium look and feelwaterproofOS look and feel like stock androidConsapps you can't uninstallbad view anglesscreen to glossvolume buttons bad placeexpensive"
Great phone. Love it so much!
"Amazing camera, brilliant display, good battery life, sexy looking, super fast! Seriously a good phone!"
"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015ZLA37I?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0This phone was purchased for my son. He gave me his z3 mini since I had issues with the new phone I had just purchased. I understand android is not for everyone but he likes it.The phone is a step up from the Z3. Runs faster and holds more internally with a slightly larger screen without the thickness of the phone. The battery light is an improvement, but as with all things, it depends on how it is used. The phone does heat up quite quickly while playing games, but that's only a minor detail. All in all, a good solid phone with a fair amount of customization options and themes."
"I'm not too impressed with the phone so far. The overall design is very similar to the Z3 except for the finger print scanner which is great. I like how the charge port is on the bottom of the phone without a cover unlike the Z3's side covered port.I took my Z3 all over the world where the battery life was excellent and the signal was great. I find traveling with the Z5 to not be up to par with the Z3. I feel like I'm constantly charging the Z5 and I have a harder time acquiring service. At home (in the US) my Z3 had full bars and good 4G LTE connection all over the state. With the Z5 I only get half bars and it drops calls (not often but compared to the Z3, which didn't drop calls, it's a little annoying). With the Z3 the charge would last a full day to a day and a half. Now I have to charge twice a day with the Z5. Not all the time depending on usage, but it's obvious the charge doesn't last as long as the Z3's.Also, the Z5 seems to overheat. More so than the Z3 did. Just turning it on seems to heat the phone. I don't have my Z3 anymore so I can't compare the two.I feel like I wasted my money buying a finger print scanner. Maybe I have a defective phone? Maybe service sucks in the US because it's an Asia model? Overall, I'm not impressed."
it great but the one I get it can't connect to mobile internet.
"I am very pleased with my new phone. I was nervous, having only used an iPhone up to this point, but the Xperia app and the cord made to bridge the phones to jump info to the new Xperia made this phone a very worthy replacement for my old iPhone. I couldn't be more pleased. I haven't run down the battery yet, it handles everything I need it to do, and is a very attractive phone. The sound quality is something I was worried about -- worry not! The sound quality is every bit as good as my iPhone was, if not better. The android platform really isn't that hard to get used to on this phone either. I'm already spoiled rotten, no turning back."
"Since android 6.0 update battery does not last a full day, roughly 13-14 hours with little use, and worst of it all, the ""waterproof"" is virtually a lie, dropped in the sink, the second it touched the water, the phone immediately stopped working, now i'm out 500 dollars."
"Great phone, unique n slick... Nearly gave it a 5 star but it does heat up much quicker than any phone I have used in the past"
Amazing I love it
"It's a Flagship phone of 2015. It'll do everything and it'll do it all well. Had the Z2 and loved it, and this phone fixed all the small annoying stuff which makes it all that much better."
Really like the style and processing speed. But the screen is pretty sensitive and cracked when I tried to get something in its wedges with a fingernail.
"I am the sony fan since the sony ericsson time. I love the Z series. The first Z was the great purple color. I love purple. I bought it right away, but it does not work for my T-Mobile. And almost two month later, T-Mobile has the T-Mobile z, so I bought another one cause I need network. After that I did not change until Z3 cause I am afraid of the issue happened again. Z3 has the beautiful white, pure white. Then Z5 came, but the white one is silver. Finally I see this pink one. It looks very nice. I was worried about the network, too. But maybe because Z3 already has the set up in memory, the thing is I do not need to set up and is able to use. Really love it. I did not buy the premium because I think the size is a little bigger for me."
Excelente
A+++++++
the best phone
"I've used the cellphone 3 months and suddenly turned off after getting very hot. I've being told it's the battery and the mainboard. There's nothing I can do, and the seller is not giving me any answer. DON'T BUY HERE"
Good
Loving my new so far!!! No complains!! Arrived on time
"The phone came in exactly as described (it is shipped from CA). International stock (so no instruction manual in English) and with a European plug (seller included a converter to US - thanks for being thoughtful!). The phone is perfect and was easy to set up - really not much difference to a US bought one. My old Z2 had a regular SIM card slot, so I actually had to make a trip to ATT store to get a Micro one for this phone (it's free), but everything was smooth and quick and the phone works just fine. Thanks!"
I love Sony smartphones. I have been using Sony for most of my life (except for a Galaxy note 2 for 2 years) and never been disappointed. The finger print sensor is on point. Love the design although it is a little bulkier than the Xperia Z3 that I used previously. Never the less it still feels good when handling. The Phone also works with USA T-Mobile for those who might be wondering.
"came with a power button that was falling out of place, was replaced with a new device"
Excellent product. Works in Perú. I'm really happy with this phone. Totally recommend this seller.
Camera button insensitive
The phone is good but it don't get my mobile service provider so it's not really unlocked.
"As in description, good choice."
The PHONE is CRAP THE BATTERY IS DEAD AND DOES NOT CHARGE I have it for about 2 weeks.Before it completely died It would take VERY LONG TO CHARGE NOW THAT THE BATTERY IS COMPLETLY DEAD IT DOES NOT CHARGE AT ALL A WAIST OF MY MONEY AM SO MAD !
"Satisfied, everything arrived on time"
loved it
I love it
"My sister loves the phone, but it wasn't the single sim version, we recieved the DUAL SIM version of the phone. Made it difficult to do rooting."
This is my 2nd xperia. I love these phones. This phone was as expected however when I powered it up everything was in Chinese. I can't read Chinese so it was a bit of a challenge to get the language setting to English. Would have been nice if the seller let me know that beforehand. Otherwise an awesome phone.
The cellphone was dropped in water (as it is supposed to be waterproof) for some minutes and now the display stopped working.
perfecto
"I am just knowing the cellphone but i am totally satisfaced with it. That's and excelent phone, I am really happy with the ellection"
"The phone works perfectly, has everything I was looking for in a smartphone. It also arrived exactly on time and the packaging was excellent. I just love it!"
"very satisfied with the shipment, excellent product, fulfiled with published thanks"
"I have had the phone for 1 day now, this is a quick review.Phone can go hot sometimes specially at set up when you are cramping all the apps and info from your other phone, nothing crazy about overheating like the Z3+ or the M4 which runs very hot.Camera is Great even at night on manual mode(with some light obviously)Fingerprint sensor works well, same as the Iphone 6, sometimes you will have to place your finger correctly and retry. But it works well and fast.Phone is very responsive and it comes with Quick Charger already, the entire battery can charge in about 1hr and 15 min.I do get get LTE speeds (T-mobile) on this phone mostly on band 4 in the NYC area, however instead of showing LTE is shows 4G, but this might be a configuration issue since the phone apparently is from Honk Kong or Taiwan or somewhere else in asia."
works great!
"When I turned on the phone everything was in Chinese, but not sure if that is normal! be Careful what supplier you use, because I check warranty status for my phone and it does not have warranty, I didn't see what any specification like it when I did buy it!"
"Nice design and great battery life, but still have heat problem when you using video."
i didn't find the camera resolution as great as they picture it.
Received as advertised. No scratches and all.
I have problems with the signal is not. Good at all I not recommended to buy it m
Good..Thanks
"This phone was used because when I turned it on, it was one user created in some oriental language. At least its battery was used and damaged, it doesn't last more than 6 hours (even without been in constant activity) when it's suppose to last much more time as per my previous experience with sony smartphones. Totally dissapointed"
Magnific. Vanguard
I've had my Xperia z5 for almost a month now (1-21-16) and it has been working like a charm. I use T-mobile with it. I would recommend taking it to T-mobile first. However they could not get my data to work. I ended up Googling apn settings for T-mobile. Now it works perfectly.
"Love the look and feel of the phone. I love Sony phones, however this phone was shipped defective. The touch is not working properly, unable to text once phone is on for a bit, overheats, and also this phone DOES NOT work in LTE when using a Straight Talk AT&T card. Will not work in LTE no matter what APN settings you enter and straight talk confirmed this. Supplier is even requiring me to pay for return shipping on a defective product. Not at all happy with Quality Deals."
"Forget about all the reviews out there saying this phone doesn't heat up. This phone heats UP big time! Especially after using for couple of minutes (just browsing and some Apping)!!! If you run Antutu, man, you probably can fry an egg on the nice etched back glass.However, you can't really blame on Sony, it's Qualcomm SD810's fault. But again, why do you want to use SD 810, Sony??? Just use the SD808! For God's sake, use SD801, who cares about 32 or 64-bit. So, it's kind of Sony's fault.Minus b**ching about SD810, the phone itself is great!Pros:- Great screen, beautiful color, and VERY bright.- Simple and nice UX- Camera focusing is fast, but images can be noisy indoor/low light- Very premium feel, wonderful design. Thumbs up for the back etched glass... No more fingerprints all over the phone!Cons:- Heat problem. Although Sony probably set a higher temperature threshold for apps to shut down by SW, you can still feel it.- Battery life isn't that great. I have a z3, and it seems to last longer and COOLER.- Volume bottom's location is a bit awkward.- Sony, can you just hire some image processing engineers from Apple? You have great image sensors. But, man, the color of photos looks really weird sometimes. Even Samsung's photo looks better than yours on their phones... And they are using stupid AMOLED.From a super Sony fan."
Upgrading from xperia z to xperia z5 this phone is massive!!
Good for the money
"I got it without any damage in 1 week. Overall, it's a nice phone. I do not have any problems with it. Nice design as well. Like sony!"
"very disappointed to receive this phone and is not inexpensive and it is visible that was used, the phone back has an scratch the box does not looks new the film over the face of the phone has being removed before. returned for full credit"
I absolutely love this phone. Came when expected and exactly like it was described.
Took a while but excelent product
Awesome phone
Absolutely awesome! Thank you Sony.
Very good 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
"I have t-mobile, phone works perfect, would recommend it. I got the gold, the phone feels, looks, and performs good."
"I'm upgrading from my Xperia Z3Compact and besides the finnicky software sony provides for transferring info(doesn't work actually) the phone is otherwise outstanding. Crisp, clear display, fantastic camera, no complaints at all. Love it."
"Alright so after about a full month of using, I think I'm ready for a review now. First of all let me note that I use a E6683(Dual SIm) and its from Hong Kong. The first thing I will say is YES the LTE does work in the US, be it T-mobile or AT&T actually any GSM carrier will do.Screen• The screen is really sharp even though it's just a 1080p, thanks to it X-reality. However if you were to compare this to a Galaxy S6 or any smartphone with a AMOLED display, I would say the AMOLED does produce more vibrant color. Pixel vise I highly doubt anyone can tell the different unless you hold the very very close to your eyes (which of course, not a lot of people will do that). I do think that reading on the Z5 is more comfortable thoughSound• Sony has a lot of commercial regarding about their ""Hi-res"" music and ""Hi-res"" player and I think they are right. The stereo front speaker is nice since you will rarely block it but don't get your hope on it since its not really that loud. I mean you wouldn't want to use it as an entertain system with a lot of people anyway. Next the headphone, I've seen a lot of review saying the sound quality isn't as good as the other smartphone out there, in this case I will have to take a different ground. I own a Sony MDR-1ADAC and the sound is amazing when pair with the Z5. I tried compare with it Galaxy S6 and to me I feel like there is clearly different quality in music. On the down side, you are require to have a Hi-res music quality otherwise the quality isn't that . . . .Performance• ""SoC 810 does it overheat ?"" my answer is ""It really depend"" If you're recording a 4K video then yes it will definitely heat up but so does the other smartphone. Gaming vice I think the Z5 is doing fantastic, the Z5 can run any game so far that I tried smoothly. It does though lag sometime when it heats up (rarely, like 1% ) and has low battery mode is activate. It definitely run smoother than my HTC oneM9+ haha.• Now everyday uses such as email, texting, web surfing, all of these are buttery smooth. In fact I would say any flagship is the same in this area, unless you came from an IOS which is a lot heck smoother.Camera• That hybrid focus ! Yes it focus really fast BUT it take like a WHILE to processing the image. If you came from a Galaxy S6 or even from an Iphone 5 you will notice a substantial different in time. Iphone took a picture in like a blink of an eye, while S6 is a little slower than that but still in a blink of an eye. But for the Z5 its like 1-2 second on camera processing after picture was taken which can be huge deal if you really need to get that picture. I would say the Z5 is more like a digital camera since it be ""hit"" then done. The image quality though I would say the Z5 is better compare to the S6 or Iphone 6 but its not really a by a big margin though. Also if you really want to take a professional picture, then any smartphone wouldn't do as of now. Overall I wouldn't sacrifice the 1-2 second for a little better camera, but if you can live with that, then I would just say go ahead.• Front camera is okay but wouldn't say it's the best out there in the market compare to like a selfie centred phone. It does produce a satisfy result though.Software• If you like Stock-Android then you will probably like this too. It ran almost identical to stock android except with the small app. There's a bloatware but you can un-install it or just disable it. The finger print scanner on this phone is superb, its super and way more accurate than the Iphone 6 or even the S6 (at least to me).• This is for people who has a PS4 and want it to use for a remote play. It work technically but don't expect the same experience from the TV also a good internet connection is require to a smooth remote play too. Unless you want to connect you Z5 to a Lan cable, which work haha (I did that :D)• The battery on this phone is last longing, you can expect a whole day or more with this phone. The charging is quite slow to me though even with the Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 but maybe I was just used to a tiny battery of an Iphone 6 and S6.Phone• The phone also come with expandable storage which could give you an 32GB boost in less than $50• The water proof and dust proof thingy isn't really a big deal if you're always careful around with your phone• The strap hooker or whatever it call, to me is something I really miss. With this I can use the phone without fear of dropping, I can even take a photo without fear of dropping the phone into a river, jungle, mountain or so whatever you can name it.OverallThe phone is a premium phone if you ask me but does it worth the price, I wouldn't say it worth it to buy this phone as of now. The music quality on this phone is superb if you use a Hi-res audio and headphone. The camera is also really good but take about 1-2 second longer than the IPhone or S6 to process the image. Heating isn't something you have to worry anymore, as per gaming it will eventually heat up after a while of playing but so does every phone. Overall I would say this is a great phone, it would be perfect for me if the camera processing is at least as fast as the S6"
Everything is excellent. Display is awesome. Extraordinary camera. Sometimes gets overheated when apps stays on in background. Disappointed with the quality of handsfree comes with the phone. Very poor quality handsfree given by sony.
Excellent device. I do not regret that he had bought. Sony did not disappoint as always

"From the stand point of design, speed, interface, photo quality, water resistant properties, and fingerprint implementation of the phone, it's an fabulous phone. The only reason I had to return the phone (and I still miss it although I only had it for a week) was that it does not connect to T-mobile's 4G LTE bands. I spoke with T-mobile and looked through various APN and Network mode settings, there was just no option for ""LTE"" connection despite the fact that it seems to have the hardware for the T-mobile's LTE bands. If any one is able to connect the Z5 to the T-Moble LTE band, let me know, I will gladly buy the phone again!"
"The Xperia Z5 is an improvement over the Xperia Z3+ with a new fingerprint sensor the phone if fast, I can go a whole day without charging it up I charged it the night before and the following night it still has power left. The camera is amazing and clear in low light and bright, but I expect improvements to come with updates, as I know they can do better on the software side, still the best camera on a phone."
Is good
"good waterproof phone, excellent camera, only drawback when taking video, the phone heats up to much"
I absolutely love this phone best in the world but this model should show LTE but it only shows 4G and i am very iritated by that i called tmobile and they said give it 3 days to update my imei and it will be LTE i hope so.
"great phone, but not for USA....."
Awesome phone. One of the best phones made by Sony and super stylish for girls with the pink color. Loved it
Excellent Xperia device. Sony continue to outdo themselves.
All good
Super nice phone. Especially great camera and display for the price. The PS4 remote play is cool too.
"I bought this last year, thought it was the best phone on the planet until it met 60 seconds of water. Now the mainboard is fried....."
Great Phone!!
ITS SO FAST I LOVE IT
Great device.
"My phone worked well for some time and then it wouldn't stop giving trouble , i reset it and now its unresponsive and in Chinese"
"The phone look new, work great, and nice phone , But the phone is open box and poor shipping box."
HAPPY
Worked fine but had mad overheating problems and crashed. It could have been a faulty product that I got but i returned it and got the new Moto G. Return process as easy enough but it took a while.
"Great phone, does overheat. A shame that Sony hasn't marketed this in the US at all. Great battery life. Fast processor. Happy with it."
Was nice phone easy to use really very good
Great item
"I ordered a single sim version, but I got a dual version. It's still pretty nice."
Awesome phone
"Phone is awesome. Seller (universal goods) was immediately responsive when I had a question and a request, after I had purchased the item. Overall, the seller was great to work with. The phone itself is super fast and easy to use. Thanks!"
Great!
excellent recommended terminal
"Amazing cam fast, i love it"
"Mine comes dual sim, the first day after upgrades, Screen turn Black and the device does not started. Now it is working fine after repair the firmware on the computer"
"Amazing, all great"
Nice phone:-)
For my friend Diego!
"Love the phone, good battery performance, so far I can say is the best one I have had."
I love sony smartphones and I love this even more and more.
Is good
"The phone I received does not turn on or charge, even after reset. I've contacted the seller and requested an exchange but has yet to respond I'm even willing to upgrade to the premium. I will be filing a claim within 24 hours for receiving a defective product. I am trying to work this out but I need communication from the seller ."
"Sony experia phone got here fast and it looks so amazing. Had to look up a YouTube video on how to change the font to English, cause it was in Japanese I think or some foreign language,but fairly enough easy to change and hella good phone. I recommend this buyer, for anyone looking to buy a smart phone."
I am totally satisfied.
"(Update review) 4 month now with the phone and i got a problem the power button stop working to wake the phone i have to use my nail because the button is stick to the phone this problem is common in this model this is a nightmare(power button stuck so is a hardware problem). I chat with sony support and they told me this phone is a hong kong version so they can't help me. (Sorry for my bad english)The phone is beautiful the feel is really premium the back of the phone is so much better, is matte so you don't have fingerprints problems anymore and is anti scratch, the sound of the speakers are really good the speakers are in the front(i like that). the sound with the earbuds are excellent Sony has his own Equalizer (in sound settings) the sound is really good with earbuds.The screen is really good but is not the best, Sony has bad viewing angle and the screen is too glossy(still is a good screen maybe in top 5 screens). i think samsung S6 have better screen and better camera. The first few days the phone is little heat in the top corner because i used a lot installing and doing updates and playing with the phone , but later days you have no problems with the heat.The battery is a beast some days i come home with 60% and the charge is so fast, Sony call it quick charge.The volume buttons are in really bad spot, sometimes i dont know if my phone is upside down because the position of the volume are in the bottom really weird, took me a week master the volume :).Sony is really late with this phone because is not better in speed screen or camera than samsung S6 is so late to the market i think carriers is Usa don't want this phone.(review date) The sim card and memory slot are really difficult to take out at the beginning you have to check youtube to do it, then is easy, i like that you don't need a pin to change sim card so when i travel i can change sim card in the plane with no problem.So why i bought this phone ? i do a lot of exercise and i always have my phone in my pocket and usually the sweat kill my camera.(that happend with my last 2 phones) this phone is waterproof so i have no problem running or Jogging or in the gym and the sound is crazy on spotify the phone is really beautiful the camera is very good the android version is good, look almost like stock android there's some apps that you can't uninstall, you have to life with those apps :( (i hate that) I know samsung S6 is $150 cheaper but for my lifestyle is better for me Z5 i am really happy with the phone. The question is: This phone is for you?Proscrazy good sound with earbudsBattery lifegood cameraexpandable memory sdfast chargingpremium look and feelwaterproofOS look and feel like stock androidConsapps you can't uninstallbad view anglesscreen to glossvolume buttons bad placeexpensive"
Great phone. Love it so much!
"Amazing camera, brilliant display, good battery life, sexy looking, super fast! Seriously a good phone!"
"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015ZLA37I?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0This phone was purchased for my son. He gave me his z3 mini since I had issues with the new phone I had just purchased. I understand android is not for everyone but he likes it.The phone is a step up from the Z3. Runs faster and holds more internally with a slightly larger screen without the thickness of the phone. The battery light is an improvement, but as with all things, it depends on how it is used. The phone does heat up quite quickly while playing games, but that's only a minor detail. All in all, a good solid phone with a fair amount of customization options and themes."
"I'm not too impressed with the phone so far. The overall design is very similar to the Z3 except for the finger print scanner which is great. I like how the charge port is on the bottom of the phone without a cover unlike the Z3's side covered port.I took my Z3 all over the world where the battery life was excellent and the signal was great. I find traveling with the Z5 to not be up to par with the Z3. I feel like I'm constantly charging the Z5 and I have a harder time acquiring service. At home (in the US) my Z3 had full bars and good 4G LTE connection all over the state. With the Z5 I only get half bars and it drops calls (not often but compared to the Z3, which didn't drop calls, it's a little annoying). With the Z3 the charge would last a full day to a day and a half. Now I have to charge twice a day with the Z5. Not all the time depending on usage, but it's obvious the charge doesn't last as long as the Z3's.Also, the Z5 seems to overheat. More so than the Z3 did. Just turning it on seems to heat the phone. I don't have my Z3 anymore so I can't compare the two.I feel like I wasted my money buying a finger print scanner. Maybe I have a defective phone? Maybe service sucks in the US because it's an Asia model? Overall, I'm not impressed."
it great but the one I get it can't connect to mobile internet.
The PHONE is CRAP THE BATTERY IS DEAD AND DOES NOT CHARGE I have it for about 2 weeks.Before it completely died It would take VERY LONG TO CHARGE NOW THAT THE BATTERY IS COMPLETLY DEAD IT DOES NOT CHARGE AT ALL A WAIST OF MY MONEY AM SO MAD !
Great product . Works as expected
Great smart phone ever.
"best phone yet from Sony of course! wonderful camera , very fluid and tastefully simple looks"
"Italian version, supposed to be fully unlocked."
"Phone looks nice and is constructed well. The screen looks good as well. However I was unable to connect to AT&T LTE or receive MMS messages, SMS were no problem. I took it into a local corporate AT&T store and after messing with the phone for about an hour to try to get it working right I was told the phone was not supported by AT&T.I scoured message boards and tried a couple things to get it working right but just decided if it won't work out of the box it is not how it is described in the product description. You shouldn't have to spend hours trying to get it to work right.Do yourself a favor and just buy a Nexus phone. It's unlocked and works right out of the box."
"First off I'm coming from a xperia z2 which died after a year of use. Did plenty of research on this smartphone and even the other flagships of Samsung, LG, HTC,etc but only this Sony phone I was satisfied with just hope it doesn't die like my z2.Pros- Camera, fingerprint, display, speed, sound, body design, fast charging.Cons- Battery dies faster than my Z2, no PS3 controller support which really is sad for me, gets a little hot.Other than that I'm satisfied with everything else. One other thing the fingerprint scanner doesn't works when your finger/scanner surface is wet."
"The battery sucks... and it sucks hard because on Z3 the stamina mode used to work pretty fine. On this model, not only it does not make any difference but also the phones last with little use a day and no more.another thing.. it gets HOT... sorry..but it does.It has some advantages, such us the charger outlet. Finally no need to have nails to remote the lid and plug it.The rest works just fine but there is nothing fancy on this new model."
"it was missing a lot of things ,the charger , the card ,and the box was open"
Arrived as expected and works perfectly fine
Absolutely awesome! Thank you Sony.
Very good 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼

"I've used the cellphone 3 months and suddenly turned off after getting very hot. I've being told it's the battery and the mainboard. There's nothing I can do, and the seller is not giving me any answer. DON'T BUY HERE"
"I have been using this phone for two months now.I love it a lot.The screen is beautiful.The size is perfect.The camera take amazing photos even in low light conditions.No performance issue at all with the 3gb of rams and fast processor.32gb system memory is plenty and no more headache about insufficient memory for apps and data.Plus with the sd card slot supporting 64 and 128gb cards, I can put thousands of photos and mp3s without worrying about running out of storage.Battery usage is not bad with Android 6.0.One charge can usually last me a day of regular usage in most ocassion.It only drain fast if you use the camera for hours since the photo sensor does need a lot of battery power plus you are keeping the screen on while taking photos.The fast charger comes with the phone only need less than 3 hours to get the phone fully charged.Water resistant features is a great bonus for those of us who live in Seattle.Not too many phones offer this important and overlooked feature.This phone is certainly a keeper."
As a former employee I have only used Sony products and this phone was what I expected. I have not had any problem in the two weeks that I have been using and I am really enjoying my music. I will use the camera more while on vacation this year and can update on performance later.
"Amazing phone works smoothly and takes phenomenal photographs! Great green color and beautiful screen! Doesn't have overheating issues as in previous Xperia phones :) Product arrived in excellent condition from seller. Only comment would be to have a better wall socket adapter, it doesn't stay in very well"
"Great build, feels really nice with the frosted glass, but my the camera experience is terrible and buggy and just can't compete which is a shame since Sony is the manufacture of the camera in the Iphone 6s and Galaxy s7. Silky smooth skin on android is great and the best skinned version of Android, but Sony please update your camera."

Great case
The Phone is Excelent! And exceed my expectations! Shipping on time!
"The phone is beautiful and definitely has premium look and feel. Pros - full LTE support of all US carries, water/dust proof resistant, supports SD card up-to 200Gb, excellent camera, stellar 2 days of medium battery use. Cons - I think processor is slightly lagging comparing to my year old Moto X 2nd gen. 5Ghz AC WiFi radio is not very reliable, fingerprint sensor stopped unlocking the phone occasionally and fails back to a PIN.The phone was upgraded to Android Marshmallow (6.0) after a week of use; therefore, some of the systems glitches may be attributed to the ne"
Excelente!
"I am very pleased with my new phone. I was nervous, having only used an iPhone up to this point, but the Xperia app and the cord made to bridge the phones to jump info to the new Xperia made this phone a very worthy replacement for my old iPhone. I couldn't be more pleased. I haven't run down the battery yet, it handles everything I need it to do, and is a very attractive phone. The sound quality is something I was worried about -- worry not! The sound quality is every bit as good as my iPhone was, if not better. The android platform really isn't that hard to get used to on this phone either. I'm already spoiled rotten, no turning back."
"I ordered my phone from Cellphone Lifestyle and it arrived early and looked exactly as expected. This is to replace a T-Mobile Z3 that I dropped and broke. I very much liked the Z3 but T-Mobile no longer offers them. This new Z5 is freakin awesome I totally love it. Just a lovely and elegant design, and it's plenty speedy for whatever I use it for. I just popped in my old SIM card and it worked perfectly. Hard to imagine ever not using a Sony phone again."
"this is by far the most beautiful phone i have own , performs excellent and fast , clear voice , take the best pictures i have ever seen by any camera , feels good in hand and pocket ,display is awesome ."
"I've had my Z5 for about a week now and I am more than happy with it, lots of upgrades, the fingerprint scanner is super fast, responsive, accurate and we'll positioned; the camera is outstanding, the focus is top notch and colour representation couldn't be more accurate and stunning unlike iphone's saturated photos and the front facing captures a lot of detail, great for selfies. The ui remains simplistic and elegant which is why I prefer Sony's take on Android, very fast, no lagging at all and multi-tasking couldn't be easier, I use the little calculator a lot. The over-heating have been resolved although it does heat up a bit when running a lot of apps and from heavy usage and battery life is awesome!The design is stunning, you can see and feel it's premium and the frosted glass back is much better in terms of looks and how it feels. Only thing I did notice is that the front facing speakers on my Z5 were louder, but other than that, it's a great flagship phone, highly recommended and it's WATERPROOF! No need to wait for an alternative version like Samsung and iPhone hasn't ever had that feature so, yeah. Great job Sony."
In my opinion the best smartphone on the market.
"I bought my sony xperia Z5 in October. The device is really nice , although overheat with extended use of the camera.However the device has a serious problem ! It is presented as resistant to water, but my unit filled with water and i cant turn it on before I had to clean it in the sink. My advice, do not buy this device !!!Sony, what a shame!!!!!!!"
"great phone, update helps. fingerprint scanner is fast and works 9 out of 10 times, camera colors are reproduced but quality of pic and zoom is amazing. screen is very good and so is the battery life. charges quick with quickcharge 2.0 have dropped this phone in a glass of water and ran it under the sink many times and it works just like its advertised. the matte gold finish is amazing and doesnt attract fingerprints at all. android os is simple and works really well. front speakers are not bad, bluetooth connects really fast compared to my note 5 and iphone 6s. solid phone with quality written all over it. wish the bezels were smaller thou"
The phone is great. The only recommendation would be to set the international version to English.Packing was very good.
"Here is what I personally think of the Xperia Z5.I have to say this has to be the best phone I've ever used, the features are incredible and so is the hardware. I've been an iphone user for about 6 or 7 years, in all that time owning a galaxy s3 and having a horrible experience of it breaking the second week I had it, so to me it was too delicate and expensive. So just until a few months ago I had the ""all new"" iPhone 6 plus. Before that I had the I phone 5s and it was pretty solid and fast for the time. Well just after owning the I phone for about a month the camera stopped working so I had to send it out to Apple to get the camera fixed, turns out they sent me a new one. Well all was good for about two more months when one day I forgot my phone in my back pocket and sat down in my car and I shattered the screen and bent the thin aluminum housing.that was it after seven years it was over, it was time for something else.So on to the phone...Compared to the I phone this phone is way ahead of its league. Let me start of with what I've noticed in the week that I've owned the phone. When I go to you tube and choose the 1080p option it works flawlessly with zero buffering,as to the I phone I could never watch 1080p, it would never load. Another thing is the keyboard, it is spot on. It is rare if I ever press the wrong letter while I'm trying to type, where as the I phone I would ALWAYS press the wrong key, it was extremely frustrating. Another thing I like is the ability to choose from 8,16,20,23 mp depending on the type of picture your taking and they all come out extremely detailed. Plus the ability to record in 4K. So far I love it. I also like how everything is connected. If I set a reminder or appointment it will automatically sync with my account and I'll actually get an email. So far that's all I've discovered for now, this phone is packed full of features and options I haven't even had the time to take advantage of. All I can say is I'm more than happy I made the decision to switch and chose a great phone to replace it with."
"1. Beautiful design, looks absolutely premium.2. Camera: A huge upgrade from XPERIA Z3, I feel that it produces better photos than my LX-3 does.3. Removal of the lousy flip covers on Z3 makes the water-proof function more practical, I took it with me to Santa Monica beach and take pictures in the sea - no problem.What I don't like -1. Sometimes It can take almost 10 seconds to launch the camera.2. Battery life is not as good as Z3. My Z3 COMPACT has 70% power left after 5 p.m. and Z5 has only around 40% to 50% so it's burning almost twice of the battery.2. Overheating at the upper part of the phone (above the NFC logo), but it's acceptable as most of the time you won't be touching that area"
I've had my Xperia z5 for almost a month now (1-21-16) and it has been working like a charm. I use T-mobile with it. I would recommend taking it to T-mobile first. However they could not get my data to work. I ended up Googling apn settings for T-mobile. Now it works perfectly.
Good
Loving my new so far!!! No complains!! Arrived on time
"The phone came in exactly as described (it is shipped from CA). International stock (so no instruction manual in English) and with a European plug (seller included a converter to US - thanks for being thoughtful!). The phone is perfect and was easy to set up - really not much difference to a US bought one. My old Z2 had a regular SIM card slot, so I actually had to make a trip to ATT store to get a Micro one for this phone (it's free), but everything was smooth and quick and the phone works just fine. Thanks!"
I love Sony smartphones. I have been using Sony for most of my life (except for a Galaxy note 2 for 2 years) and never been disappointed. The finger print sensor is on point. Love the design although it is a little bulkier than the Xperia Z3 that I used previously. Never the less it still feels good when handling. The Phone also works with USA T-Mobile for those who might be wondering.
"came with a power button that was falling out of place, was replaced with a new device"
Excellent product. Works in Perú. I'm really happy with this phone. Totally recommend this seller.
Camera button insensitive
The phone is good but it don't get my mobile service provider so it's not really unlocked.
"As in description, good choice."
Great clarity for the screen - seems like 4k has arrive to cellphone.
"I have had the phone for 1 day now, this is a quick review.Phone can go hot sometimes specially at set up when you are cramping all the apps and info from your other phone, nothing crazy about overheating like the Z3+ or the M4 which runs very hot.Camera is Great even at night on manual mode(with some light obviously)Fingerprint sensor works well, same as the Iphone 6, sometimes you will have to place your finger correctly and retry. But it works well and fast.Phone is very responsive and it comes with Quick Charger already, the entire battery can charge in about 1hr and 15 min.I do get get LTE speeds (T-mobile) on this phone mostly on band 4 in the NYC area, however instead of showing LTE is shows 4G, but this might be a configuration issue since the phone apparently is from Honk Kong or Taiwan or somewhere else in asia."
device will not charge regardless of the cable used.
I love just about everything about this phone. Except that it heats up a little bit after using it for a while.
Good
Nice phone with good camera
"Please I need some help with a BIG problem with this phone. First I don't live in USA, I live in Ecuador, I bought the phone with the help of a relative. I received the phone in perfect conditions, no problems with hardware or software. The first two weeks I enjoyed a lot the phone. But two days ago, I had a terrible issue: the phone stopped working. The screen is in black, the LED of notifications doesn't work, the phone won't turn on. I'm not a novice in this kind of things, so I tryed to turn on the device. I've tryed in three different ways: firstable I tryed to hold on the power button with the +volume button for 10 seconds and the phone is supposed to vibrate but anything happens. My second option was the little OFF button which is located near from the sim card, I read that holding on the OFF button for 10 seconds can help but again anything happens, other sources say that you have to hold on the OFF button for 120 seconds, I've tryed but again, anything.Finally I tryed with the PC Companion, but when I start the process the PC doesn't recognize the phone, and it says that I have to hold on the power button with the +volume button, but again anything happens.I didn't do anything weird with the phone, just installing the most common apps, do some calls. But the phone just stopped working. It's obvious that is not the battery, I checked it before the phone died and the battery was in 80% of charge. As you can read, I tryed a lot of things but the phone don't want to come alive again. I don't think the problem is the screen because as I said, even the LED of notifications and the vibration have gone. I'm really mad about that. I'm searching for a special center here in my town, but I want to tell you my problem. I hope that someone can help me with this. Finally I want to show you that the phone is not broken or things like that. Thank you for reading and excuse me if I did somegrammatical mistakes."
"The phone came with many apps already installed both in german and chinese (Tmobile and more). Makes you guess wether if I bought a new phone or a recicled one. Moreover, there is no warranty. And also it arrived with a very dirty packaging also in chinese.Despite that, I can say it arrived quick and has been working great, does great photos and works with 4G and 3G."
It didn't come with the headphones/earings
Best phone ever! Sony doesn't disappoint.
YesVery good device
"If you're on T-MOBILE, PLEASE READ. This phone not being set by and for T-Mobile needs to manually be updated. After setting the APN, give it a day if not sending or receiving MMS's. The fingerprint is awesome; Answering machine, yes answering machine works perfect. Other than that, no major update from the Z3 which I owned before purchasing this one."
"Here are the problems within couple hours if buying1)slow charging time2)overheatd very quick3) its not a true black color4)front camera is ""wobbly/wavy""5)overall camera quality is bad, in all lighting6) do not buy7)couple of screen freezes8) one of my headphones wouldn't work on this"
"Love the look and feel of the phone. I love Sony phones, however this phone was shipped defective. The touch is not working properly, unable to text once phone is on for a bit, overheats, and also this phone DOES NOT work in LTE when using a Straight Talk AT&T card. Will not work in LTE no matter what APN settings you enter and straight talk confirmed this. Supplier is even requiring me to pay for return shipping on a defective product. Not at all happy with Quality Deals."
"Forget about all the reviews out there saying this phone doesn't heat up. This phone heats UP big time! Especially after using for couple of minutes (just browsing and some Apping)!!! If you run Antutu, man, you probably can fry an egg on the nice etched back glass.However, you can't really blame on Sony, it's Qualcomm SD810's fault. But again, why do you want to use SD 810, Sony??? Just use the SD808! For God's sake, use SD801, who cares about 32 or 64-bit. So, it's kind of Sony's fault.Minus b**ching about SD810, the phone itself is great!Pros:- Great screen, beautiful color, and VERY bright.- Simple and nice UX- Camera focusing is fast, but images can be noisy indoor/low light- Very premium feel, wonderful design. Thumbs up for the back etched glass... No more fingerprints all over the phone!Cons:- Heat problem. Although Sony probably set a higher temperature threshold for apps to shut down by SW, you can still feel it.- Battery life isn't that great. I have a z3, and it seems to last longer and COOLER.- Volume bottom's location is a bit awkward.- Sony, can you just hire some image processing engineers from Apple? You have great image sensors. But, man, the color of photos looks really weird sometimes. Even Samsung's photo looks better than yours on their phones... And they are using stupid AMOLED.From a super Sony fan."
Upgrading from xperia z to xperia z5 this phone is massive!!
Good for the money
"I got it without any damage in 1 week. Overall, it's a nice phone. I do not have any problems with it. Nice design as well. Like sony!"
"very disappointed to receive this phone and is not inexpensive and it is visible that was used, the phone back has an scratch the box does not looks new the film over the face of the phone has being removed before. returned for full credit"
I absolutely love this phone. Came when expected and exactly like it was described.
Took a while but excelent product
Awesome phone
ITS SO FAST I LOVE IT
"Since android 6.0 update battery does not last a full day, roughly 13-14 hours with little use, and worst of it all, the ""waterproof"" is virtually a lie, dropped in the sink, the second it touched the water, the phone immediately stopped working, now i'm out 500 dollars."
"Great phone, unique n slick... Nearly gave it a 5 star but it does heat up much quicker than any phone I have used in the past"
Amazing I love it
"It's a Flagship phone of 2015. It'll do everything and it'll do it all well. Had the Z2 and loved it, and this phone fixed all the small annoying stuff which makes it all that much better."
Really like the style and processing speed. But the screen is pretty sensitive and cracked when I tried to get something in its wedges with a fingernail.
"I am the sony fan since the sony ericsson time. I love the Z series. The first Z was the great purple color. I love purple. I bought it right away, but it does not work for my T-Mobile. And almost two month later, T-Mobile has the T-Mobile z, so I bought another one cause I need network. After that I did not change until Z3 cause I am afraid of the issue happened again. Z3 has the beautiful white, pure white. Then Z5 came, but the white one is silver. Finally I see this pink one. It looks very nice. I was worried about the network, too. But maybe because Z3 already has the set up in memory, the thing is I do not need to set up and is able to use. Really love it. I did not buy the premium because I think the size is a little bigger for me."
Excelente
A+++++++
the best phone
Sony quality is very good.
"Satisfied, everything arrived on time"
loved it
I love it
"My sister loves the phone, but it wasn't the single sim version, we recieved the DUAL SIM version of the phone. Made it difficult to do rooting."
This is my 2nd xperia. I love these phones. This phone was as expected however when I powered it up everything was in Chinese. I can't read Chinese so it was a bit of a challenge to get the language setting to English. Would have been nice if the seller let me know that beforehand. Otherwise an awesome phone.
The cellphone was dropped in water (as it is supposed to be waterproof) for some minutes and now the display stopped working.
perfecto
"I am just knowing the cellphone but i am totally satisfaced with it. That's and excelent phone, I am really happy with the ellection"
"The phone works perfectly, has everything I was looking for in a smartphone. It also arrived exactly on time and the packaging was excellent. I just love it!"
"very satisfied with the shipment, excellent product, fulfiled with published thanks"
Great device.
"My phone worked well for some time and then it wouldn't stop giving trouble , i reset it and now its unresponsive and in Chinese"
"The phone look new, work great, and nice phone , But the phone is open box and poor shipping box."
HAPPY
Worked fine but had mad overheating problems and crashed. It could have been a faulty product that I got but i returned it and got the new Moto G. Return process as easy enough but it took a while.
"Great phone, does overheat. A shame that Sony hasn't marketed this in the US at all. Great battery life. Fast processor. Happy with it."
Was nice phone easy to use really very good
Great item
"I ordered a single sim version, but I got a dual version. It's still pretty nice."
"I'm not sure what happened here but this was the first smartphone I purchased with this many issues. Battery was heating up during charges, would only last for 2 hrs on a full charge and that's without downloading any apps (bone stock). Would exit out of stock apps unexpectedly. Just one issue after another. Was not pleased"
For whatever reason i feel the Z3 is better phone than the Z5.If you go from a Z3 to this Z5 you may be slightly disappointed
It was all good yo
Tus
4week very nice. 好看不卡
Espectacular
"Great phone. Everything about this phone is perfect, for me at least. It is fast, light, and great for everything that oyu need. The only issue is how warm it can get, but it does not get as warm as other 810 SOC."
"Excellent phone, Sony always have greats phones."
"i ordered my phone from the seller Quality Deals Shopping Center ,it is taiwan version,comes with fast charger,better than HK version and China version.long time not use a sony celphone.i used Samsung galaxy note 5 s6 and edge,LG gflex 2 iphone 6 and plus nexus 6 etc.....so now sony Z5.there are so many reviews on the net about this phone,so i just wanna say somethings about my feeling.#1:the heat issue.i downloaded the game modern combate 5 with the screen on,about 2 hours to completed everything,and played it about 1 hour,the phone got warm.yes just warm,not heat at all! and nothing happened with the app.it's normal like the orthers bands.even my s6 edge got more heat than the z5 under the same use.so don't worry about this issue on z5 like z3 plus.#2:the fingerprint unlock.it is fast! more than the s6 and edge! yes i do mean it! on my s6 edge i had to wait about 1 sec to unlocked the phone,but not on z5.just like iphone,maybe faster! it won't let you down!#3:the screen,sony did the great jobs on this! it is beatiful sharp than my s6 edge with 2k screen.#4:software.it is like nexus,clean and not so much apps of sony.i am not boring yet like when i played my s6 edge.it is smooth!#5:battery.enough to one day uesd! without the stamina modo on!so i like my z5,more than the s6 and edge,maybe the note 5 will take it down for some ways.but no one is perfect,even the iphone!"
Camera is just OK. Nothing else stands out. Pricey!
"good waterproof phone, excellent camera, only drawback when taking video, the phone heats up to much"
I absolutely love this phone best in the world but this model should show LTE but it only shows 4G and i am very iritated by that i called tmobile and they said give it 3 days to update my imei and it will be LTE i hope so.
"great phone, but not for USA....."
Awesome phone. One of the best phones made by Sony and super stylish for girls with the pink color. Loved it
Excellent Xperia device. Sony continue to outdo themselves.
All good
Super nice phone. Especially great camera and display for the price. The PS4 remote play is cool too.
"I bought this last year, thought it was the best phone on the planet until it met 60 seconds of water. Now the mainboard is fried....."
Great Phone!!
ITS SO FAST I LOVE IT
works great!
"When I turned on the phone everything was in Chinese, but not sure if that is normal! be Careful what supplier you use, because I check warranty status for my phone and it does not have warranty, I didn't see what any specification like it when I did buy it!"
"Nice design and great battery life, but still have heat problem when you using video."
i didn't find the camera resolution as great as they picture it.
Received as advertised. No scratches and all.
I have problems with the signal is not. Good at all I not recommended to buy it m
Good..Thanks
"This phone was used because when I turned it on, it was one user created in some oriental language. At least its battery was used and damaged, it doesn't last more than 6 hours (even without been in constant activity) when it's suppose to last much more time as per my previous experience with sony smartphones. Totally dissapointed"
Magnific. Vanguard
I've had my Xperia z5 for almost a month now (1-21-16) and it has been working like a charm. I use T-mobile with it. I would recommend taking it to T-mobile first. However they could not get my data to work. I ended up Googling apn settings for T-mobile. Now it works perfectly.
"Finally a phone that works without any hiccups or issues. This phone simply works. I have not had any weird issues at all with this phone, and let me tell you, that is rare. Normally I'll find one nagging problem with a phone and it'll drive me crazy until I finally cave in and decide to purchase a new phone. So far, in using my Xperia Z5, I have not run into any weird situations like that. Overall I love the form factor of the phone, and the build quality is incredible. This phone simply feels well built. There is no creaking or play on the phone. This thing was engineered flawlessly and Sony has truly done a great job. Let's look at my overall take on the phone:Screen:Recently Android phones have seen a big push for larger and larger screens, but the Z5 decided to buck that trend and not offer a bigger screen or crazy resolution. Instead, Sony stuck with a smaller screen size of 5.2"" and a resolution of 1920 x 1080. Although in a battle of specs, this sounds bad, I can say the screen looks really nice. Colors are well balanced, and I have not had any issues in the sunlight with this phone.Waterproof design:The waterproofing also hasn't let me down. Sony does not recommend submerging the phone, but I can speak from experience, this will probably not damage the phone. I don't recommend doing this for two reasons though: 1- With some bad luck, water may actually damage the phone. 2- You can't really use this phone underwater.Battery life:As a moderate user, I need a phone that can last me throughout the day. This is actually one of the reasons most phones just don't make the cut for me. This phone actually manages to do a pretty respectable job of making it through the day. Screen on time caries between 5 hours and 6 hours, but that is what I'm usually getting most days. I have the phone set up to enable Stamina Mode, which saves a lot of battery once the phone hits 50%. This is different than the normal battery saving features that most phones have. Instead, Sony disables almost all background processes and only syncs when the screen is on and the phone is ""awake."" Basically, what this does is it allows the phone to enter a hibernation mode, if you will until the next time you use the phone. Calls and texts will come in, as will many things, but emails or other programs which use data will not sync until a set interval or until the screen wakes up. Overall, the phone will easily last a whole day from 6 am until about 10-11 pm.Camera:This part is hit or miss. It really depends what you're looking for and how picky you are with cameras. As a hobby photographer, I love to have a great camera. Taking a cell phone out and knowing it'll take great photos is a must for me, and Sony really sold this phone as having one of the best cameras out there. Sadly, this is rather misleading. Does the phone take good pics? Yes. Is it one of the best cameras? No. This camera struggles in the dark. If you turn off flash and take a picture in a poorly lit room, this camera kicks up the ISO and you get a blurry, noisy mess. In daylight, the camera works flawlessly. The nice thing about the camera is that it is a wide-angle lens, so you'll get much more of the image in the frame than you will with most other phones. If you are looking for a true manual mode, this just doesn't cut it. Sony has mind-boggingly integrated a terrible UI and limited what you can do to 8 Mp. I just don't understand what they are trying to do. Set the camera to superior auto, and it jumps back up to 23 Mp and takes great pics. The thing Sony just doesn't get it I don't need them to hold my hand. Let me set the camera to manual and get creative.Call quality and speakers:Call quality is good and people have not had issues hearing me. Actually, the only time this was a problem was after I had washed the phone. Water blocks the mic and people won't hear, but then again, this makes sense and shouldn't be an issue because when was the last time you made a call underwater or being dumped water on? Speakers are not the loudest, but they work well enough. If you're looking for an extremely loud phone, this isn't it. Sometimes I have a hard time hearing Waze over the radio, but I tend to have the radio a bit too loud sometimes anyways.Overall:The camera would have to be the one biggest disappointment. I think the battery life is good, and the design and feel of the phone is great. The minimal skin that Sony puts on the Z5 is also welcome, and Sony will be updating this device to the latest version of Android, but they do take a bit. Sony tends to update most of their phones, but they do take a bit to make sure everything works. With these ideas in mind, I definitely like the phone. In typical Sony fashion, they throw a bunch of features that you may or may not want, but if you find a device that supports a feature this phone has (LDAC is a great example of this), then it simply works. No headaches, no weird set up. This is what I wanted in a phone, and I'm pleased having purchased the Xperia Z5."
this phone is very well build. it will not show LTE on the display but it as fast as lte so trust me is ok
Signal not table and fingerprints not while work compare to another phone out there
love the phone its what ive been looking for now i dotn have to worry about getting it wet.
Excellent
"It's all in the details, everything about the device is striking. It is the embodiment of Sony and grants you access to all of the Google and Sony Entertainment Network services."

Good
the battery life not the same
"Phone is awesome. Seller (universal goods) was immediately responsive when I had a question and a request, after I had purchased the item. Overall, the seller was great to work with. The phone itself is super fast and easy to use. Thanks!"
Great!
excellent recommended terminal
"Amazing cam fast, i love it"
"Mine comes dual sim, the first day after upgrades, Screen turn Black and the device does not started. Now it is working fine after repair the firmware on the computer"
"Amazing, all great"
Nice phone:-)
For my friend Diego!
"Love the phone, good battery performance, so far I can say is the best one I have had."
I love sony smartphones and I love this even more and more.
Good
I upgraded from Xperia z2 to this Dual Sim z5. Im very happy with this purchase. It was a logical upgrade as most of everything is the same- however Sony has made decent upgrades. the exposed charging port is 100% better then the old hidden under a flap on the side of the phone. Also the Finger print reader works flawless and is hidden under the power button on the side. Speed and performance wise ill say the Snapdragon 810 is a mild improvement then the Snapdragon 801 in the z2. I have noticed the phone gets much warmer when i have it doing tasks such as backups or downloading larger files while doing other tasks as surfing the web. However being a water resistant phone cooling it off is as easy as running cool tap water over the front and back of the phone. Battery life has also been more or less the same. I can get a full days of use without much issueUsing the Dual sim feature is awesome as i dont need to carry 2 phones around. this phone also makes it easy to switch between sims 1 and 2 without physically handling the sim cards.
Excelent.
"I love this phone! The camera is great, the display is beautiful, very fast phone. The batter lasts one day which I think is very good considering this is a dual sim phone. I have a t-mobile sim and a movistar sim on it and it runs very smoothly. Sony did a great job with the software that manages the SIMs. The only thing I didn't like was the earplugs that it came with, but I use some noise cancelling headphones that I have instead."
works in Costa Rica
Excellent product.
I am saying that I received and I did not get
"Had doubts ordering, seeing as how it is not yet available in the US market, but I really haven been wanting this phone for a long time. I'm glad I did. Original packaging, neat and new, arrived in three days, and called Sony and they were able to pull up phone on system using serial number.Word of advice, this product will be available I'm the US market at best buy for $699, as of February 7th but the model will not include a fingerprint scanner. So, obviously, this is a better route to obtain a Z5.Am happy with my purchase."
Excellent
Vera Good Phone
"Insufficient Heat sink for the CPU. This device gets hot and will stop responding. I really wanted to like it but, I couldn't."
As was expected although import fees are huge
I had an iphone 4 and bought the Z5 thinking that it was an easy choice because it has a great camera. My problem is with the Andriod OS. It is not nearly as intuitive and easy to use as an Apple OS. I gave it to my son and bought an iphone SE.
Good phone
i love my cellphoneRecommended
"Very capable and user-friendly phone. It is under-rated out in the market,"
"Great phone, received on time, works perfect!"
I like
Great!!!
excelent!
"I love that Sony offers a variety of sizes for their devices to suit everyone's need! It's sleek, has a great battery, and love the color options to customize."
"I love this phone! I've had the s7 edge, HTC 10, X performance, but this one takes the cake! It's so smooth and feels great!"
Excellent product!!
1000% perfect
Is an excellent telephone
Best phone in the world. A little dissapointed with the fingerprint sensor. Not many good unlocks there..

Nice
姨父的微笑..Love Xperia Z5 Dual Sim! Support Sony.
"I have had this phone for about 2 weeks or so... Unfortunately, I am NOT satisfied at aaaalll and I tried SOO HARRD to love this phone. Sigh...When I first got this phone, it was overheating right out the box and the battery was running down so fast. It went from 50% to about 36% in less than an hour. Another great disappointment was that the phone kept overheating from me just going through the phone. There were no games and nothing was downloaded as yet. It was just me checking out the new phone. Yet I felt like I was playing a racing game from the amount of heat it gave off.Later, I tried updating it and each time the updates wouldn't finish. The phone would get so hot, I could not hold it! I had to pick it up from the bottom in a corner and that is not safe! I could not touch the upper 3/4 of the phone.So finally after about 2 days the phone finally accepted the system update. The overheating from menial tasks subsided but the battery life was still poor so I had stamina mode activated permanently to help it. I even downloaded a battery doctor to help support the horrid battery. I really wanted this phone to work out.Let me jump on the camera for a bit.. The camera quality is excellent. However, to my great disappointment, when I took a picture with the flash on in the night, it was HORRIBLEEEE. I tried flash in the day just to see how it would turn out.It was also a great disappointment.What happens is when the picture is taken with flash, the bottom half of it is faded into green or white. Then the entire picture appears translucent and blurry. This happens EVERY time I use the flash.Now, this problem is the worst of all... Everytime I get a call and I answer the call, the phone goes blank and unresponsive. I cannot hang up. I cannot put the phone on loudspeak. I cannot see how many minutes I have been talking for. NOTHING!!! I have to wait until the other person hangs up!!! Sometimes even after they hang up, I STILL can't use the phone until a few minutes after. This is madness.Oh and its the same problem if I dare to use the phone to call anyone. But what actually makes calling worse is, if the person I am calling does not answer, it goes rings out and goes to the answering machine over and over again because the screen stays blank and I cannot stop it. Then when I press the power button nothing happens. The answering machine and the ringing just keeps going while the screen stays blank.So, still determined, I called Sony Xperia support and I was told to repair the phone with the Xperia Companion. I did that. It took about 4 hours. So happily, I rebooted the phone and then... The same problem with the calls persisted -___-....That was the last straw, I didn't have the phone for even a month yet the amount of defects and problems I've had over this 2 weeks was unbelievable. I inquired earlier and was told this phone is new. I cannot believe that with the amount of problems I have experienced. I REALLYYY wanted to like this phone. I really did but good gosh, I've tried everything and stressed myself out in the process. I cannot do this anymore."
Best phone in the world. A little dissapointed with the fingerprint sensor. Not many good unlocks there..
"I always love SONY's picture quality, that's why I've been always using Sony phone, this one is my 3rd one, Z5 has nice design and dual sim version is convenient for me to use 2 sim cards togehter, it works under 4G lte network here in the US, I'm using T-mobile. Its picture and audio quality is still brillant, but the Andriod system is not as smooth as IOS, I have to say honestly, it's still a bit easy to get heat after taking some pictures and battery is running fast as well probably because I haven't found any apps to root it yet, so there are a lot apps automatically started and I can't stop them, but as long as the system doesn't freeze, I still like it."
Excelent.
"Greig8 phone I like that nice picture. The only thing I didn't like is to be a dual sim standby instead of active, meaning that I can have a call on one sim and I still can receive another call from another."
"The U.S. market is really missing out... I was a little nervous buying from overseas, but Sony's Z5 is one of the nicest unlocked mobile phones I've ever owned. This is the dual SIM version, and originally ships from Sony's manufacturer in China (apparently dual SIM devices aren't as popular in Japan [don't worry, it ships with a power converter]). The phone came to North America in a reasonable amount of time, and it's packed with useful features. I can't really name them all, but some of my favorites include the 200GB expandable microSD slot, waterproof design without the annoying rubber plugs, superb audio volume and screen quality, optional 4K video recording mode, digital stabilization, up to 5 fingerprints can be saved for quick access, lanyard port for extreme sports enthusiasts, decent battery life (depending on power conservation mode), incredibly fast processor, etc. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the phone doesn't overheat at all under normal use – which was one of my other points of hesitance. It might get a bit warm after recording in 4K or playing a graphically demanding game for a while, but that's the same even for DSLR's.One crucial thing to keep in mind, however, is this phone is most readily compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile networks in the United States. If you go to Japan, I believe it's Docomo and Softbank (AU has its own version of the Z5), and if you're in New Zealand then 2Degrees is the way to go."
"It is nice phone in design, features, camera ...Except it is getting quickly very hot . It is completely unbelievable, if you use some apps more than five minutes, you will not can touch the phone because of heat sink!!!!!I expect better phone from Sony!"
:-)
Nice
姨父的微笑..Love Xperia Z5 Dual Sim! Support Sony.
"I have had this phone for about 2 weeks or so... Unfortunately, I am NOT satisfied at aaaalll and I tried SOO HARRD to love this phone. Sigh...When I first got this phone, it was overheating right out the box and the battery was running down so fast. It went from 50% to about 36% in less than an hour. Another great disappointment was that the phone kept overheating from me just going through the phone. There were no games and nothing was downloaded as yet. It was just me checking out the new phone. Yet I felt like I was playing a racing game from the amount of heat it gave off.Later, I tried updating it and each time the updates wouldn't finish. The phone would get so hot, I could not hold it! I had to pick it up from the bottom in a corner and that is not safe! I could not touch the upper 3/4 of the phone.So finally after about 2 days the phone finally accepted the system update. The overheating from menial tasks subsided but the battery life was still poor so I had stamina mode activated permanently to help it. I even downloaded a battery doctor to help support the horrid battery. I really wanted this phone to work out.Let me jump on the camera for a bit.. The camera quality is excellent.

very good cellphone
the phone sucks it dies quick. freeze for no reason. crushes all the time.
Awesome. Love this phone. Best series of phones out there. Runs smooth. Amazing picture and video quality. Sound is outstanding.
it fits perfectly
good
Astonishing performance
The charger plug is bad
This is a high performance smart phone.This allows you a comfortable life if you get this.
Amazing!!
"One amazing smartphone!The only thing is that instead of 4k I was only able to view 1080p videos on Youtube, for instance."
I have received opened package and used phone!
Super
Thankyou
Great phone! The screen is really clear and the quality of the build is amazing. An excellent alternative to an iPhone IMHO.
"This is the worst device I've ever owned. The pros? Beautiful design, great camera (when it works), and dual sim (when it works).Cons:Dual sim freezes or restarts the phone when switchingBattery life is horribleOverheatsAudio from the dual front facing speakers is a jokeAct of Congress to get it to connect to Bluetooth and WiFiCannot view the screen outsideI'm appalled that Sony had the nerve to call this premium.First and last Sony ""dumb-phone"" I'll ever purchase.Seller is A+ though."
The best and the price in this moment is very high+ Good and deluxe cell
"Love it!, but i don't know why it didn't come with the original sony charger, it came with a Samsung Charger!"
"Okay, just so you know, I am what you might call an ""early adopter"" In other words I am a sucker for smartphones. Every time somone came out with something new I just had to have one for my own. Ever since I brought home my brand new first generation iPhone, I have always been enthralled with these little magical rectangles made of metal and glass. I have had every iteration of iPhone, right on up through the 6S. I have had three HTC's including the amazing M7 and M8. I have owned a OnePlus one, an LG V10 a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, and I still use my S7 Edge as a back up phone. But, I can honestly and unequivocally say that not a single one of them hold a candle to the Xperia Z5 Premium. The 4K display is amazing of course, and the camera is incredible, but what makes this phone stand out is that every little feature that it has works flawlessly. I liked my Galaxy phones but both of them would heat up, lock up, refuse to connect to my car via bluetooth, refuse to charge ...the list goes on. On the other hand, the iPhones worked perfectly, but the un-customizable UI just became so damned tedious after a while. Enter the Z5 Premium. It has none of the cartoonish color saturation and UI of the Galaxy models that the tekkies fawn over. The Z5 Premium just has a 4K display that is smoother, cleaner perfectly colored and blows your mind when you watch 4K media. Anybody who has ever seen a Sony Bravia HDTV as compared to a Samsung will know what I mean. The Sony makes the images look like they are recorded on smoothsilky 16mm film, while the Samsung's images ""pop out"" but look like they are recorded on soap opera videotape. Moreover, every single little feature that glitches or lags, or freezes the Samsung, the Z5 Premium handles without even breaking a sweat. The Z5 Premium's hardware feels ""premium"" in the hand and it's solid, minimalistic, thin bezeled design is pure art. Oh, and did I mention that it's water resistant? Yeah, customizable too. I read somewhere that the Samsung Galaxy S7 is the ""Lamborghini"" of smart phones. Let the kids have their ""Lamborghini"", I will happily keep my ""Aston Martin"" Xperia Z5 Premium.Sony Xperia Z5 Premium Dual E6883 5.5"" 23MP 32GB Smartphone - International Version / No Warranty (Black)"
The product has exceeded my expectations. I've seen so many bad reviews about Sony's devices and this one in particular as well that I was afraid of purchasing this expensive device. I'm just loving that it has a lot of features other Android devices are far from having. I used to have a Samsung Galaxy SIII rooted with a lot of extra features that did not come with Samsung's Android.The only thing I really miss from my older device is the root feature I used to use a lot. I just don't root this one because of warranty issues and DRM keys issues. But don't think that most users will ever need that. Sony has made this with already awesome features.
"Always overheating device, and sometimes the device stuck and freeze, and The device too heavy. But the good thing the camera."

"One amazing smartphone!The only thing is that instead of 4k I was only able to view 1080p videos on Youtube, for instance."
I have received opened package and used phone!
My everyday phone for the last 3 month's no complaints
"This was purchased by a hacker who hijacked my Amazon account, so I cannot say anything except make sure you secure your Amazon account and change your password often!"
The phone box was opened.
"Beautiful phone. arrived in full retail packaging, factory reset. flawless condition.. Brand new.Shipped via prime and arrived on time. Inserted sim card and I was up and running. The screen itself is gorgeous, but not very bright. battery life is downright poor. Camera is pretty good... I like the way Sonys take photographs.Sound too is a plus. Many reviews speak about speaker quality. I for one rarely use the external speakers... I use Bluetooth all the time. I'm coming from a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge and found the edge attenuated Bluetooth too much. Sonys Bluetooth streaming is strong and rich. ClearBass does a superior job in delivering sound to my listening devices.The fingerprint scanner is also far superior to the edge in terms of placement, speed and accuracy.The seller delivered on the product."
"One of the most beautiful phones around, but this it......... Its runs hot, turns off after 2 minutes of 4k recording, and is just buggy."
So far so good works as advertised
"This product has been the absolute worse. The ONLY good thing about this product is the camera. The display and brightness is despicable. Even on the brightest setting it seems like it is only 50%. I get 75% battery usage in a day barely using it. I take it off the plug at 9am and it projects that it will die by 4pm. My phone is fully optimized on top of that. When I check my battery info it says my screen uses 40%-50% . How is that possible when I am working all day barely on my phone. I really wish I never got this phone. Its very glitchy, and absolute mess. I have less than 10 download apps. Nothing different than my last phone. This is crazy, the way this performs I would expect from a $200 smartphone. Sony really oversold the experience and expectations with this one."
I like the phone it self but i dont like the package ship not professional.
I've had for 4 days now and I couldn't be more happier than my old Z3. It's fast and yes it gets hot at some point but it cools down quickly. It is faster than my Z3 and the build is way much premium than the Z3. I would prefer the metal body like the recently announced Xperia X1 series. I immediately upgrade the OS to Marshmallow and haven't found any issues with it so far. I'm glad I purchased this phone.
"Just a brief first impression;Ordered it on sunday, got it on Tuesday. fast shipping !The package is not sealed and looks like the phone was not new. Not cool.No manual, only in Chinese. Well there is Sonys webpage. If you pay 640 bucks for a phone you could expect more, at least some multilingual manual.The phone comes with a Chinese power plug and a US adapter. Charging worked ok. Just remember to plug the adapter in the right way....The phone itself is setup in Chinese. Yes you read right. Took me a while to figure out how to switch it to legible characters, ie English.When trying to order a nano sim card from ATT, they ask to call their customer service, for some reason unknown to me. More to follow tomorrow!"
"This phone is terrible.Common problemsBLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK - Google ""Sony z5 premium bluetooth""Over Heats - Google ""Sony z5 Premium over heats""Auto Camera mode is terrible. Unless you keep your phone on manual and adjust settings with every snap.. prepare to have terrible pictures. Google ""Sony z5 Premium camera tests""Laggy - Google ""Sony z5 Premium Lag issues""Apps freeze and crash often - Google ""Sony z5 Premium freezes""The thing I can't get over is the Bluetooth. Its at a low priority on the processes list I guess, so If you're connected to Bluetooth car, headset, speaker and do anything else, the music freezes and is choppy while you're using your other application. At first anyways.... Eventually music was like listening to a scratched CD. Skipping and freezing. Then today it just stopped. I can connect to devices with my Bluetooth, bu no audio is produced. This problem is super common with hopes of being fixed with the 6.0 update... but no luck. Of course Sony customer support offers 0 help aside from, turn it off and on or if you're not connecting with Sony products it must be a comparability problem and the other manufacturer's fault. Should have gone with the S7"
Amazing cell phone.
"IT WAS A USED ITEM - NOT NEW. Package did not have manufacturer sticker. When I turned on the phone, it only had 2% battery with initial screen all set up. It did not prompt me to set up account or preference. They did not even bother to correct with manufacture reset. Very disappointed. I had no choice but use it, as my previous phone was pretty much not functioning. If you are selling refurbished, you should clearly state it. I paid full price and received half open, poorly reset phone. I feel misled."
no other comment.
"I got it the screen was defective on top left corneryou are not able to touch, all major apps have menu on exactly that port of screen and you will be not able to get thare, yoy have to start it every 30 minutes its working 30 minutes then its gos back to that position"
Excellent...no problems with anything...shipped to Alaska...and might I say...WHAT AN AWESOME PHONE!!!..
"OK, I was very excited about this phone after watching lots of reviews about it.mainly about 4K ,camera 3GB ram desinge and built quality.in the past i used Note 4-iphone 6 plus and currently using nokia 1520.I have to say i was very disappointed with the screen resolution , I watched many videos including 4K & 8k (yes some 8K videos are avilable now).and it looks poor , note 4 is much looks so much better and 6 plus and Nokia 1520 are still better .screen is not sharp to be 4k at all and hardly looks like 1080.looks dark even after adjusting display.camera is ok. but my 1520 is far better image quality.that is probably cause Flash in 1520 is so much better than the one in Sony .Design and size is the best thing bout this phone , other than that nothing impressive.I decided to return it and go with note 5.Too bad Nokia stooped making phones any more."
"LOVE THIS PHONE! Works great on Tmobile USA! Waterproof, been in the rain on the handlebars of the motorcycle. Camera and AMAZING! Good speakers and beautiful screen. This is my 4th xperia phone and they never let down. I just wish sony sold these in the USA so I did not have to import and have no warranty, but i have had the phone for nearly a year now with no issues!"
"Would gave it a 4, but I ordered chrome and got black."
"Great phone. Beautiful build, top of the line hardware and screen but Do Not bring this anywhere near water."
excelent !!!
"Came brand new, came in Chinese automatically, but easily changed to English, just wish it had delivery options, but the product is excellent!"
Amazing piece of hardware couldn't be happier
"I've been using this phone for a couple of days now, and after watching, reading, and hearing all these reviews as well as feedback from others, I had an idea of what to expect going into purchasing this device.I saw a few have issues with the phone bending, similar to the iPhone 6 Plus when that first released. I've been babying it and taking care of the phone as much as possible, and in that time I've fallen in love. My personal experience is the UI is nice and clean, similar to stock Android with a few added extras, and it's very responsive. I know it's not 4K all the time, and until the Marshmallow update releases, there won't be much support as of yet, however the up scaling of videos in the YouTube app still look simply amazing. The camera isn't really want most hyped it up to be, but I find that it works well and edges out my Note 4 and my father's iPhone 6S Plus, which is perfect enough for me.From the general feel of the build quality, I'd have to mark Sony down as the ""Apple"" of Androids, since I haven't personally felt that the other Android devices did it for me. I tried the Note 5, S6 Edge Plus, iPhone 6S Plus, Nexus 6P, and multiple others, but the Xperia takes the cake in feeling the most premium to me. Calls sound crystal clear, and the front facing speakers, while not as powerful as some HTC or Motorola phones, still sound much better than my previous iPhone.All in all, love the device, hope Sony continues to push out updates for it in the future, and I may stick with them should they continue producing this type of quality into their devices."
"Awesome phone, but after a few months of use, definitely a bit too big for me. Might go down to the regular version instead. 4k screen shows zero difference vs other screens."
"Cool Gadget. A beauty to behold...Expensive? Yes but its still worth the hype. Finger Print scanner on the Power key is fast and responsive every timeBattery Life is not exactly 48hrs but i keep everything on so i cant really benchmark.to achieve two days battery life, you have to enter stamina and ultra stamina mode which really turns the phone into a dumb large phone since you'll have to give up all the cool smart features for a very reduced battery consumption. the battery barely discharges if it is inactive and that gives me a comfort feel that i wont loose charge when the device is not in use"
"I have been switching from a phone to another for a while and the last phone I got was the Nexus 6P. I tried LG, Motorola, Samsung, HTC, iPhone, and Nexus 6P. I never gave Sony a chance, because I haven't seen them doing any major advertisements so I assumed it isn't a great phone. When I used the phone, I regret not buying Sony phones before. The phone is so user friendly and so clean of a software, even better than the pure Android like the ones, which comes in Nexus lineup.Basically you are buying quality !! a product that is well build and carefully crafted, and the software is perfectly modified.The only thing I don't like is the finger prints left on the back of the phone and the lack of the number of cases available to purchase.Update: Sadly I returned the phone, because I was getting Black Screen of Death during my calls. I can't do anything when I get it until the person I am talking to hang up then the screen turn back on. I tried all the fixes, but none of them worked, so I ended up returning it. I liked the phone so much, but I don't want to risk buying a phone that has a common issue since the Z2."
"This phone are really amazing!!! I purchase the phone trough Quality Deals Shop Center and for my surprise the phone came with the UCH10 Quick Charger and an amazing headphones. like ever, Sony make the best smartphones. the camera is really amazing, I'm impressed because the quality is superior from others high ended phones. the phone is simply beautiful and it looks PREMIUM. The fingerprint scanner works really amazing, much better than iphone 6s and galaxy S6. the screen is GORGEOUS, I can't explain it in words. the stereo speakers sounds very clear and super cool, but my old Xperia Z2 sounds a little louder than Z5 Premium. the led light is situated in the corner of the phone and is very small, for me, the led light of my old Z2 looks a lot better than this, positioned in the superior speaker and it was much larger than the Z5 one.The battery life is AMAZING and the quick charger works excelent, the phone charges completely in 1 hour approximately."
This is something worth getting !!!
The phone worked great for under a year and then the antenna broke and I couldn't get a signal from the cellular network anymore.
Excelente
Excellent product!!!!
"xperia line has never disappointed me and the z5 after a few month is my favorite up to date, I'm thinking of getting the xz soon."
"I bought my Z5 Premium From The Wireless Circle and it's a Singapore version if you want to know. It works well. No sign of being a dud like China's. Fingerprint scanner is good and fast. No sign of overheating or getting hotter than normal. Works with ultra mobile which are my services. Overall I definitely like it better than the Z5. I'm sure it'll work well playing remote play with the Ps4 and ps1, gba and all the other emulators just like the Z5. Camera quality really is good and so is 4k recording. Very stable and steady and I love it. Took the risk of ordering international since I don't trust China. But Singapore is doing me well :) no regrets."
Good
My favorite phone so far. Sony rules Samsung sux.
"Within a month the phone started acting up, phone jacks kept reading as if it was plugging in and out every half a second. Phone's unusable now, money down the drain for me. Steer clear and get another Xperia model."
"I love this Phone. Even today I like it I am tempted to get a new Sony Phone but they aren't making them with the 4k Screen so I have declined to upgrade as of yet. The Camera is great. Remember Sony uses a full size pocket camera sensors in their phones they work great. Plus it is Water/Dirt/Dust Proof. I have taken it in the pool and at the beach, no problems. Just washed it off wit tap water after going into salt water."
awesome phone
Amazing. Best phone i ever owned. From samsung to htc. This one kills them all. Minor issue with tmobile setting up the phone other then that it is amazing..Great battery life. quick to charge. stunning display. This is the best phone! Ashamed that Sony does not push the market and let's apple and samsung. They simply do not compare.Only issue is that i cannot use remote play without wifi :( my carrier network is strong enough. Maybe a setting I'm missing.
"Broken after not even a month of use. Power button//finger print scanner defective. The phone just died on me, and I had to pay for it to be repaired, since there is no warranty. You are better off getting a Samsung of an Iphone for the cost. Please, please, please, don't purchase unless you wanna pay for expensive repairs."
too heavy
"only shop the U.S. if you are in the U.S. Return hassle, the camera doesn't work and the phone keeps freezing."
This thing was an amazing phone 'til it just died for no reason. No warranty on US and you couldn't use the 4k other than playing back your own recorded videos. So pass on this and get a US warranty Z5 or XZ even though they don't have finger print scanner. I keep mine unlocked with my heartrate monitor
"I've had this phone for almost a year. I use it on the T-Mobile network and the LTE works great. The camera is great! The screen is only 4k if you are looking at pictures in the Albums app and the default sony video player. The battery life is great as long as you don't keep needless features on while not using them. The waterproofing is great, I've washed the phone in the shower several times and it has not failed. I think it is funny that other brands are just now water proofing their phones, Sony is way ahead of the curve in that aspect. The power button integrated finger print scanner is a nice touch,so you don't always have to enter an unlock code. Overall the phone is great and I waited almost a year just to write a review because I really wanted to thoroughly use and test the phone."
"The phone is for two SIM cards and buy (and I came out more expensive) model is a single SIM card since this model has better performance. I request that I return the difference in the money they charged me for more between the two models, because I feel cheated. Thank you."
"This should be a great phone, with a bright sharp screen and the ip86 rating but it is almost unusable due to the constant reboots it goes through. After searching online, it seems that this is a common issue for the z5. No issues with the seller, for what it's worth."
Very good
Chinese
Love it! :3
Awesome device. Best clarity I've ever seen on a phone.
Not bad
very good phone. the only issue is the battery that don't last long. only a day.
"This is my first ever Android Phone, having used BlackBerry since 2009. So most of my ""problems"" are just learning a new User Interface / Operating System (I'd have that problem regardless of what Android or Apple phone I switched to).One feature I didn't think I'd use is the fingerprint scanner. This scanner is accurate and trouble free. I love it. Compared to my wife's Note 5, it feels like a next generation technology (I don't tell her that). The USA Version of the regular Z5 has deleted this option. Big mistake, I'd get the international version of the Z5 regardless if I was getting the Premium or not. It's a very cool scanner, very impressed with the technology.I saw a few reviews saying that LTE doesn't work - it does. It doesn't display ""4GTLE"" it only displays ""4G"" but rest assured you're on LTE. I took a screenshot of a speed test using T-Mobile, USA but AT&T is also a GSM carrier and this phone has the bands for it as well.OK, I love the screen. I know that OLED is all the rage these days but I love this LCD screen because it can dim low in a dark room and can get very bright. The auto sensor works great on this phone too. The screen is beautiful.The camera is great! Coming from BlackBerry which always used subpar crappy cameras, I admit anything would have been an improvement but it takes great photos in line with my wife's Note 5 (probably better but we won't tell her).The front stereo speakers are fine. They are not as loud as one or two out there but are louder and clearer than many if not most.I love that it's water resistant.It looks beautiful. I got the Chrome but since I'm afraid to carry it naked and put a minimal transparent case on it, I'm wondering if I shouldn't have gone with the Gold. Any color choice is beautiful.As far as the 4K - The stock 4K video by Sony does look great but so does anything I'm viewing on here. I'd base my choice between Z5 or Z5 Premium based on what you prefer in phone size and screen size rather than 4K or not.I used to love BlackBerry because I liked carrying something different (they are very rare these days in the US) and I like this phone for the same reason. Everyone has either an Apple or a Samsung - but this Sony is something different. I really like it and recommend it.I intend on updating this review at the start of 2017 to give an update on how it works long term. But the initial quality is outstanding."
"Phone is horrible. Sticks for over 10 mins, randomly. Screen turns black and you cant see incoming calls. I have no added features, apps, or covers on phone. Constantly having to reset phone. All this happens within 37 days of ownership. Seller..Mobile front...wont even respond or reply. Run from this product and seller."
This phone is greatBattery last daysScreen is hugeResolution is amazingOnly problem I came upon was the fact that whenever I made a call or received one my screen would go black. Now the call would be fine but thier was no way of me ending the call or multi task on my phone while I made the call.Everything els works great though!
"Wooow, what a cell phone. I was clearly hesitating. But I think I made a right one.Nothing to say about it"
"Awesome phone, super fast shipping, great price"
I love my new xperia z5 premium!
"I had a Samsung note 4, this Xperia Z5 Premium is way better. More powerful, nice pictures with the 23mp camera."
Wonderfull Phone i love it is reallu nice
I've had two z3 phones and now the z5 and they are not a durable phone every phone I've owned from Sony has shattered the features and picture quality is awesome . Its fast just not a durable phone if you are rough on phones
"Ordered my z5 premium chrome through universal goods, the phone got here fast I ordered it on a Friday and it got here the following Friday. Everything was new in its package and well protected with bubble wrap in the box. I have had the phone for about 2 weeks and so far I am extremely happy with it. My last 2 phones have been iPhones and this phone is far better in every aspect. I've seen reviews of people complaining about the finger print scanner but I have not had any problems yet its extremely responsive to the touch. Also since I had read those reviews I simply used two Id fingerprint scanners for the same finger so that might have helped. Overall it's an amazing phone, great image display, sound, function and quality. I never realized until now how greatly underrated Sony phones have been."
Great solid phone!
"This phone is amazing, Sony really created a good product. I believe it's the best android phone you can get now, specially 4K camera and display. The only unfortunately thing is the battery capacity."
"It Is a great phone, it met all my expectations. I was a little confused with the card, it uses a nano sim card, but I went to my carrier and they cutted it and helped me set up the Internet connection LTE. I have been using it for almost a week, so far, so good. The fingerprint sensor works well. Camera Is amazing, took some pictures and videos and I just love them."
It's just great.!
"It glides on almost every surface...One day i was laying down on concrete floor and my phone slid off my pocket and fell about 3-4 inches before it hit the ground and cracked the screen. BE WARNED, it will slide off of metal, wood and plastic and will brake easily."
I used 8month already broken no warranty
T-mobile:Phone was delivered within the week.(standard delivery)All features work as expectedGreat looking phone with premium feelWould recommend to anyone.If you have used or owned a previous Xperia series phone this phone is a big step up
"i have been a long term xperia fan ever since i first purchases the z1 (honami) a few years ago. Now that i ahev the z5 premium i must say that i am extremely happy with this phone. the clarity of photos and video are quite amazing for a phone. and the waterproofing makes for some added fun as well when i take this phone surfing and wait for a nice wave i just watch videos or listen to music. and the battery life is extrememly good as long as you have the right settings and with stamina mode you can easily double the time you use it.now there are some things to mention since this is an international phone it is not capable of 4G, but it capable of LTE which is good because LTE is actually faster. if you want a 4G phone (slower data speed) then this is not the phone for you. Be sure to set up your mobile network and to download internet and mms setting in the settings because only idiots forget to do that and you're not an idiot... or are you?"
i love my new phone sony xperia z5 premium is really outstanding
"The Sony Xperia Z5 premium phone is one that will certainly get people's attention.It is stylish, it is a beast of a phone, and above all, it is everything you would expect from a premium Sony phone.I love a lot of things on my Z5 premium. Some are great upgrades from my previous phone, the Z1.This is just personal preferences, but I liked the Walkman App before it turned to the Android Lollipop Music App.Lollipop is just not type. I will probably revert to KitKat because I love the UI and overall feel better than Lollipop's.The power button is slightly sunken. Unlike the Z1, where it was easily accessible with a slightly outward button.Lastly, and yes, this is was shocking for me as well. The screen.With a whopping 806 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) 4K screen, you would expect the display quality to be as clear as looking out a window. So unless I bought a faulty phone, I kid you not, the screen looks pixelated. Yes, you read that right. Pixelated.Now, I know that everything except the Album and Video apps are down-scaled to 1080P. So I tested the 4K photos and videos, and to my astonishment, there they are! Still looking pixelated, even at 4K. I had to look through a magnifying glass to see them up close. I compared my old Z1, my dad's Z Ultra and the Z5 Premium. Again big surprise, both my old Z1 and the Z ultra pixels can barely be seen, with very faint black lines separating the pixels, while on the Z5 Premium the lines were considerably much more noticeable.Looking at all three phones from a normal distance, the Z1 and Z Ultra's screens do not look pixelated at all, while my Z5, even from a fair distance, you can still faintly see the pixelation.Basically, I have phone with a 4K display, but it almost makes me feel like it has a WVGA display.Lastly, I've never seen a phone reflect dots from a turned off display before. My Z5 Premium for some reason reflects dots, pixels, I don't know what they are in a squared grid pattern whenever the screen reflects light. Whether its from the Sun or any regular light, you will clearly see them. Regardless if whether the phone is on or not.Conclusion.The phone itself is awesome. Great new features, great audio, superb built quality and respectable camera.It might just be my phone, its too early to tell, since a lot people don't own this phone yet, but make sure to check with others who own the phone and ask if they see pixelation or have a faulty displays in their Z5 Premium as well.[[ASIN:B0171GYNGW Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (CHROME) - International Stock No Warranty]"
"The best phone ever! Beauty, fast anf anothers goods..."
"So far this is the best phone I have ever owned. I'm coming from a Galaxy Note 3 due to the Note 5 not having expandable storage and disappointing me in almost every aspect.First off, after using this phone I immediately fell in love with the waterproof feature. I will never buy another phone that doesn't have resistance to water, I mean honestly the technology is there, if the big companies cant get on the train and get this feature I will simply stay away. I also was able to easily expand my storage by 128gb with a micro SD. The 4K display is something I could live without but it is a nice feature and I can't complain. Battery life is very good for this device I am able to fall asleep with 40% battery from a day of moderate use, wake up and use the phone till mid afternoon with no problems. Charging is pretty fast also. I can leave the phone and forget about it for about an hour and come back to a ton of battery life.I removed a star for the fingerprint scanner getting a slight scratch within the first month of use and rendering it un-usable. Would be nice to use it but not a whole lot I can do about it. I think the next phone I will get will have to have usb type c with super high speed data transfer. We shall see what the future holds."
Amazing smartphone. Out of this world screen and terrific camera. It looks like no other and everybody will ask about it.
"Pros: Unique, Worth the money, Excellent, Powerful device!Cons: No Warrenty for International Stock :/"
Very good my sister love it
"Probably the best phone in the US that no one has heard of unless you're a phone geek. I've had to work with phones for 10 years in the cellular industry and have seen many phones come and go. I have loved the recent Xperia series from Sony and always believe that they deliver the best products. In terms of phones, it's no secret that Sony has had a rocky history to say the least (Sony Ericsson partnership and a myriad of failures).I'll try and keep this short, but at least provide some more of a detailed review. Feel free to check the other versions of Z5 Premium (Chrome and Black) for others, but I notice the Gold version is sorely lacking any thorough review so here go:I've been using this phone for about month and don't typically review anything until I have had a chance to use it for more than a few days. First impressions can be misleading, so I let myself download apps, use throughout the day, take pictures, videos, etc and get a feel for the phone. I will say I have used a few other Xperias before. I am jumping from a Xperia Z1 I purchased in Japan about 2 years ago and loved that phone as well. Probably some Sony fanboy-ish going on here, but I will try and be as neutral as possible.Performance of the phone is fantastic. Everything moves very quick and smooth. Responds very well overall. One of my favorite features (yes it's nothing new, but performs so so well) is the fingerprint scanner. Like I said, I have worked in the cellular industry and I know the iPhone first brought this to the mainstream but I've really found myself using the fingerprint scanner a lot and the fact that the phone is larger, the scanner is actually a much easier way to unlock the screen than sliding up the unlock motion. And again, it just works so smooth!Perhaps my favorite part of this phone, and a big purchasing decision, is the camera. I have two little ones and whenever the family is out, I am typically default camera man, so there was a lot of debate with the wife as to whether I should invest in a good DSLR camera or buy the loaded Z5P phone. I haven't regretted my decision as the Z5P takes beautiful pictures, 23MP, though I find myself using the 20MP 16:9 format and even the Premium Auto mode is great for taking quick shots (using the quick wake up mode). Yes, it does take 4K video, which looks unbelievable. And Sony does have a little snapshot tool to take 8MP screenshots of 4K video stills if you so desire. The 4K SCREEN ON THE PHONE looks phenomenal. I've read a lot of tech sites instantly saying that the 4K screen is unnecessary and a gimmick, however to be honest, I'm not sure what screen they're looking at. I've put up the Z5P screen next to my Z1 (1080p) and for me personally I can definitely tell a difference. The Z5P is so much clearer and the colors are very vibrant (though not overly saturated). Also, the camera has a 1080p/60fps video mode which also works great. Lastly, the camera has an insanely fast autofocus, which does actually autofocus, which helps with quickshots. Again, camera alone was worth the purchase.Battery: Always a touchy issue with so many and always the quickest to get people to stop buying your product. With heavy usage, and again, from experience, I know what constitutes heavy, you can still EASILY get a days worth of usage on your phone. I have tried several times to intentionally kill my battery doing things that typically kill other phones instantly--biggies being streaming video, games, GPS, camera and the often under-appreciated phone calls/video(data) calls. I don't think people really know how much phone calls kill your battery, but again, tried to get it to under a day and it didn't really work. I would still have about 20% at the end (say 9-10pm) of the day. Now again, I don't have the luxury of literally sitting down from 8am-8pm doing nothing but that, but throughout the day, I would watch/play/listen/etc and still had enough battery to do more by the time I put the kids to bed. Also, the last few days I've been trying something else and seeing how the battery preserves itself. During work, I don't heavily use my phone (because, you know, I'm WORKING), but even at that with 2 email accounts synced up, and other various services running (mind you, no facebook, twitter or other SNS-sorry no social life :) I still do some messaging but still have about 80% at the end of day. I DO NOT charge the phone overnight, lose a couple more percentages and start day 2 with about 75-78%. I then continue to work again and continue to drain battery and again still have a moderate (about 65%) battery. Now again, by no means am I saying this is an end-all guide to the 5-day battery phone, but again, for practical usage for people who don't live on their phones 24/7 I can easily get 3 working days of usage on my phone, maybe 4 if I push it. Again many factors go into this, screen brightness, accounts, etc. but I have been thrilled with my battery life.Ok, I'm rambling too much so I'll wrap it up. Quickly wanted to address a negative:Bezel--never understood why people think this phone has larger bezels than others. I think there was someone who actually measured the % of screen that the bezels take up and Xperias actually have a better % than iPhones and some others. Now one thing I will note is the 3 touch buttons (back, home and apps) are taking up part of the 5.5"" screen. While others, like Samsung have the buttons underneath so you get a true full screen. Anyway, minor design gripe, but still more than enough real estate on the screen.Little extra here too, again, read about how some people thought it was such a novelty that the phone was water/dust proof rated yet kept the charging port open. If you have experience with Japanese phones, you probably know that waterproofing phones is very old news. Almost all Japanese phone manufacturers, Sony, Sharp, Kyocera, make all their phones waterproof because many Japanese take their phones in the bath with them. In fact, my wife has a basic Sharp Aquos from about 2-2 1/2 years ago that is also waterproof, but already had the open charging port design implemented. Again, just a little tidbit there about the novelty of waterproofing phones, so yes the charging port is open, but the phone is still sealed. I also can attest to this as I have used the phone for pictures in not only heavy rainfall but also at a waterpark (my little girl drenched my phone but totally fine).Alright, I'm done now. Hopefully this helped out and if you purchase it, ENJOY!"
"My brother loves his phone,he is a sony xperia person so i expected he would love it"
"When it came to my door you best believe I opened it faster than the rubiks cube wr. Great phone, quickcharge, earbuds, can play your ps4 on it without losing progress from the tv and loads more. If you have the money and are looking for a unique experience then get this. Also chrome is always the way to go. A definite brgging right to be able to say "" My phones chrome and is waterproof."" I've talked long enough. 10/10"
Good
"I bought one and when I turn it on it works okay but the apps were inChineese. Also it would not pick up on a 4G LTE.. I went for it because it specified it was an international version but it did not meet its specification, so I had to return it. Sony has to improve on the 4G LTE. It does not work. I'll go for a galaxy Note"
Excellent
"Sony Xperia phones are great. Never bought an Apple, never thought following the crowd was the best way to go. Dollar to Dollar, Sony beats Apple. Waterproof, scratch resistant, and fingerprints don't really show unless you really got greasy ones, fantastic display, great sound quality. I just found it a bit big to hold in my palm, and the volume toggle is not well placed as many have complained about....so why doesn't Sony change it? 4K pics are great and so is the camera, but don't think it's as good as a ""regular"" camera with a bigger lens. Plus, buildings and tress may ""bend"" a bit depending on your picture angle which is kinda like a cheaper point and shoot. But, then again, it's a very small lens and so you will get some grainy pictures as well regardless of the megapixels."
great product!
BE AWARE... No LTE FOR AT&T for this phone which is not good and problems with screen...there is sometimes when I try to press the left top corner or the right top corner and it's not responding..... When I shut it off and turn it back on then it works..... I think these are refurbished phones and I made a big mistake by buying a phone from Internet..... WITH NO WARRANTY....
"A great phone that delivers as promised. Excellent photo quality, very fast focussing, and adequate low light photo ability are some of the great features. The battery life is astounding. It feels as a true high quality, luxury product that you can proudly carry and have people ask you inquisitively what phone you are using as it's doubtful that they have ever seen any Sony XPeria series phone. A+"
"I upgraded from iPhone 5s and I love it. My carrier is att so no problem using it. well it took me a while to figure out how to use internet. It kept saying offline without wifi environment.( I knew my sim was just fine because I used it for iphone 5s till I received this xperia) If you have the same issue like me ( for me it is the first android phone ever so I knew nothing about it) go to Setting, then tap ""More"" you will see ""Internet settings"" at the end saying ""download settings for internet and MMS"" After downloaded, then finally I see little be more reception bars (for some reasons) and started seeing LTE right next to the bar. And I could use internet without wifi. Hope this info will help someone like me know nothing about android phone."
"This phone has better sound quality than the Galaxy S7 Edge for sure, my brother has a Samsung and he admitted it.This Phone > IPhone."
"Just one month and shutdown and never work again, i call sony and tell me the cellphone dont have warranty y try to repair with a third party."
Very nice.
Died after 9 months and my a to zero claim is being denied by amazon do not buy Xperia phones
"I absolutely love this phone. I don't understand the negativity that some reviews mention. It is a sleek looking gorgeous phone especially the chrome version I got. The most amazing thing is the display, you'll clearly see a difference with its 4K display. It takes great pictures, crisp and detailed. I'm not a heavy user and the battery lasts me at least 2 days easily. Music on this phone is Sony's high standard. Coming to the software it is near stock Android and runs smoothly. I was worried about getting this phone reading some reviews but I'm glad I went ahead with it. There is heating issue but only when you use the camera for a longer period but it cools down quick too. Works perfectly in sync with the Sony SmartWatch 3. I use a clear case to show off the chrome awesomeness. This is a great smartphone and hopefully Sony comes up with the successor in the next week's IFA."
Received quickly and well packaged. I took my T-Mobile (USA) SIM card out of my Xperia Z3 and installed it into this phone without problems. The phone has a very nice display and works great.
"This is a bad product, It is a product that has no guarantee by sony."
"INCREDIBLY F' SWEET! After months of research and looking, I found this device that meets my specs and is aesthetically pleasing to the eye! Built strongly with metal bezel and chrome back, I invested in the Rhidon covers for the front and back and keep it in a leather holster when its on my belt. I am staying away from rubber or silicone covers due to signal strength being insulated from them.Sony- Erriccson knocks it out of the park with this one! Best display I ever seen on a phone.It's probably the coolest phone I ever picked up! I can tout the highest price I ever paid for a phone in my life by far, but it is worth it because it interests me.If you are tech savvy and like the challenge of customizing devices with their factory restrictions in mind, then first do your research on these models and then some, before jumping into it with utter confidence if it interests you.Thank you Sony. Thank you AT&T for awesome monthly service. Thank you NGP for a lower price than elsewhere and fast shipping less than a week. Great job listing item and speedy transaction!"
Excelent product works great in all tasks and the Best eficient batery saverThe best
Everything was perfect! Thanks
"It's a really nice phone with a great display. Stuck an AT&T sim in and it works perfectly fine here in California. Only draw back is that it didn't come in English, and that the mobile data was not working, but with a quick search on the internet took a few minutes to fix."
Thank you for selling me the best smartphone in the world. The problem is you refused to sell its accessories. Anyway thanks!
Excellent mobile.
bes phone ever
"All what is mentioned was true. Nice cellphone, nice seller"
"So far everything is working fine.Urgent info - The phone I received was configured in Chinese (Mandarin) so it needed to be reset in English which was a relatively easy task if you are familiar with the android OS.Next, in order to use any mobile data for at&t or T-mobile you must set your access point for each respective company. This is as simple as searching the APN names for either and setting it accordingly or calling technical support to get the APN designation.Notes - The phone is very slippery, I've never contemplated buying phone cases for previous phones but considering how nice this phone is I would hate to drop it. I am coming from a Sony Xperia Z(first gen) which was ergonomically superior.The camera is far superior than any other phone I've used with great clarity and fast enough to snap off some quick shots.As others have stated the sound key is not in a good position but it may be an issue of internal space. It works fine in the horizontal position which it seems more suited to. The screen is excellent with no flaws spotted yet.As with heat, I haven't noticed anything alarming. I've shot two 5 minute videos and it does get warm but nothing worse than what I've used before. It surprisingly gets hotter while on a call.Update- After a few weeks of use and the latest OS update, the heat has grown a bit but nothing concerning, The heat dissipates rather quickly when yo run you hand over it.Going back to the slipperiness. Man, its like trying to hold a ice cube sometimes. It really needs a case or rubberized bumper. I tried cleaning it with alcohol, but nothing helped.Do not update this phone to latest update. The first received OS system worked fine, there has been a few niggles with the latest software patch. Sometimes the screen will fail to rotate on apps, and will only start working again if you restart phone, or launch the camera and open a picture(only thing I've tested so far to get it to work). This has happened twice in the passed week and i don't know what is causing it, but it never happened before the update.Comparison against the new Samsung s7 edge. The edge feels significantly thinner and lighter and has more grip. This phone feels like a lead weight in comparison. This screen is a bit more vibrant in low light situations, but in daylight the edge is far superior. I personally like the bigger profile of this phone, but not when laying down trying to hold it in a elevated position. Simply too heavy without using two hands. I figured the problem with the flat blueish tinge is not an issue with the phone, but the actual OS, as it also appears to look similar on the Edge. The actual application boxes and menus are poorly colored on this OS. When viewing anything else, the color looks absolutely fine on both screens, with the Xperia having a slight edge in clarity and sharpness. The S7edge has a very smooth overlay and looks less pixelated in some cases. It's not until viewing documents and pictures/videos does the ppi of the sony stand out. The speakers on the xperia is superior in depth and direction but not as loud. The s7 edge does a better job suppressing bass which gives it a bit more clarity and loudness.The camera layout is better on the Xperia, but the edge beats it with smoothness and color reproduction. The default settings on the xperia is very bland, and takes some time setting it accordingly to get better money shots. The edge gives you a much more artistic profile strait out the box. The edge camera is also a bit faster, making it more stable. Video playback is better on the xperia given the flat edges and larger screen. I don't particular like the edge for watching videos given the curved sides. Lastly, contrary to my issues with the xperia being very slippery and heavy, i actually have a harder time grasping the edge do to the thin side profile, when scrolling through menus on the s7, it feels much more wobbly and loose in my hand.If weight is an issue i would go with the edge. This Xperia is a bigger fashion statement and the screen is slightly better. But i would say the mirror on the back of this phone yields more usefulness :). I've had three girls ask to use my phone and check out their faces with the mirror on the back."
"I absolutely LOVE THIS PHONE! I just did a ""forced upgrade"" from my previous phone, Sony Xperia Z1s to this, Sony Xperia Z5 Premium. The reason I say ""forced upgrade"" is due to the fact that my screen broke after about 2+ Years of service, I wouldn't have upgraded if it wasn't for that. Anyway I been having this phone on my radar since it was released, so I bought it. Seller shipped it quick, and it arrived ahead of time! :D The phone itself is awesome and the 4K is beautiful! The PS4 Remote Play feature is a HUGE PLUS! Works great, a little laggy at times but playable. The Chrome background is nice and camera is flawless. Phone is FAST! I received a Chinese Version of this phone, and I am using T-Mobile USA. The 4G LTE works but does not display, but with a Internet Speed Test you will see it is there. All in all, solid phone, and great purchase! 5 STARS!"
It is great!!
"The product was in a factory sealed box. A lot of non-English information included with the phone, but after the phone booted I was able to select English and it was smooth sailing after that. The box contained ear phones and a UCH-10 wall charger with US spec wall prongs with a USB cable. The phone connected to AT&T without incident but in order to get connected to mobile data, I had to download the specs. This is done though the phone settings.Very pleased with my purchase."
Great smartphone in 2015. Evething is perfect.Stephen Yang
"I ordered this and it came really fast everything. Opened it and it had all hardware. It's had USB hub charger, USB cable,and it also came with some Sony headphones.this phone is great."
"Came a day earlier than expected! The phone is brand new, booted up and is working on AT&T (and probably any other GSM network). I was pleasantly surprised that mine came with headphones and the quick charger! Hopefully, everything continues to work fine and I won't have to deal with any peculiar defects."
"just got this phone, nice phone but can't say i'm totally happy right now. First, everything connected with T-mobile in new york, 4g lte, music is great with stereo and apt-x bluetooth,Hi-Res audio, 4k screen good. Now the bad, can't get this phone to work as a speaker phone so i don't have to keep it on my ear all the time also sound quality is not that great for phone calls. the battery barely last a day,so don't understand how they make claim of two days. So I'll give it a few day and make a decision on if i should return it because it cost to much to be having any problems. P.S (give u my verdict in a few days...)11/30- Lots of good features but the battery might be a deal breaker?... The battery really sucks for a premium phone and does not live up to it's claim...i mean if you turn everything off and don't use anything or the features it has, it last two days??? reminds me of HTC EVO i had years ago i had to buy an extended battery.....and the quick charger is not so quick. Might go back to note 4, last all day with no problems...like phone but pissed off with battery..12/1-I use this phone the same way i use my note 4, and have no problem with battery. but this phone barely last the whole day ..sending it back and will wait for z6, i brought this phone to use, not play how do you make battery last through the day"
Exactly as described loved the phone and arrived earlier than expected
"Awesome phone, lots of people have commented it while I use it. Love it. The back I use as a mirror."
Product arrived on time and it was just as expected
Amazing.... Awesome
"This phone is awesome! Nice big vivid screen, stylish gorgeous looks that make you want to double take. Gives you a really good quality premium feel for a phone. Sound clarity is decent with two front facing speakers. Words of advice protect this phone from front to back because it easily slips right through your fingers making it very easy to drop, but other than that I love this phone and highly recommend it if you have the extra money to throw at it!"
nice phone
"I received a DUAL SIM Z5, even though the description doesn't say so. This is not a single sim phone. I wanted the single sim. But received a DUAL SIM Z5 PREMIU,. Though all features remain same. I do not need the dual sim."
"4g sony Z5 premium clocked at down load speed 36.7 mg's beats my techie son's samsung lte edge.sitting side by side, same AT&T; samsung son gets beat by 13 mg's"
All perfect. A great phone !!! It broadly met expectations in terms of product and service delivery. Widely recommended. I apologize for my grammar in English !.
Beautiful but gets hot quickly
"Good phone, the 4k trip is gimmicky just due to the lack of true 4k support in android atm. Cyanogenmod 13 is already in development. Stop by XDA and See the Sony repos on github. The heat issues out of the box are being worked on with custom kernels. The blah blah about whether or not to unlock the bootloader for the sake of keeping Xreality and minimally important Sony DRM functions goes like this, ""Meh, unlock your bootloader."""
"Very nice device, but I got the refurbished one. Also I found hair line scratches on the screen."
It was everything I wanted and more
HI everyone I'm from United States new York city and only work with t mobile but it will work with at&t but phone/Yes texting/yes Internet/no
"Excellent phone, honestly 4k is pointless with no support from services like Netflix or YouTube but pictures still look amazing and chrome back has a nice luxury look."
I bought this because I love Sony. Also my z3 micro USB port quit shortly after the warranty expired. I sent it in to be repaired and Sony could not repair it plus Sony removed the back and did not re-adhere it. I love Sony so I replaced it with this and love it. Don't worry about no warranty because it will fail after it expires anyways.
It has dual chip
The camera does not work after an update and I would have to send the phone back to Taiwan to get it repaired. Total waste of $$
I liked.
Just Perfect... One of the Best Mobile Phones
"This phone is excellent, good screen, battery duration is superior to any computer on the market.Apart from the above performance it is very fast has a heat sink does not hot, but it requires a lot at stake and others.The only thing against you find is that some specimens come, that does not work for Jack 3.5, and my case mine does not work, opt to solve the problem by buying bluetooth headphones."
Thicker than expected. Specs are not good as its price. Accessories boxes are bigger than its needed during shipping it moves a lot.
This is my third SONY phone. Excellent !!! I love this Phone! Everything works on it just fine. I have ATT as carrier i live in the US. Took it to ATT when i received it they put a new sim card in and no problems since. Updated to Marshmallow with no problem. I love it and my kids love it. Thank You!
"I'm a big Sony fan, and think they make great products, much more so than Samsung, LG or even HTC, and certainly on par with Apple. Sony products are well designed/engineered, solid build quality consistent with the long established reputation. Where as Samsung/LGs may have great specs. on paper and look good on the outside, their inside components are definitely lower quality in call quality, antenna reception or durability/design. Just remember there are no free lunches out there. Samsung LG is more like Honda/Toyota and will never be BMW/Mercedes. I have been using Sony smart mobile phone/tablets pretty much for the last 3 years now, and I'm hooked. From the Sony Xperia Z, to the Z Ultra, to the Z1s, Z3 smartphones, Z, Z2, Z3 tablet compact, to the Z4 tablet and now trying the Z5 premium. I have to say that While it's not Sony's fault in the SD810 processor, all the overheating issues are still true, no matter what Sony had tried, to engineer extra heatsinks to dissipate the extra heat generated by a horribly made Qualcomm SnapDragon 810. Qualcomm SD810 single handedly ruined this otherwise superior phone. From the 4k Screen, touch screen improvements, to the beautifully made premium look and feel, having all the makings of a topline product. In 90 degree+ ambient temperatures, normal use, no multimedia, the phone got hot enough that I can't take a call without a BT device, because putting it up against my face is too uncomfortably hot. Even though the phone doesn't shut down, but you'll feel like you're holding a hot potato in your hands and that's not good. This would have been a wonderful device, and potentially a top seller had it come with the SD820 chipset, what a combination that would be. This also explains why Sony decided to not sell any of the Z5s here in the US, as American tech savvy consumers will not likely put up with overheating issues. So I would say, if you love Sony's get the Z3s, no issues what so ever, or skip the Z5s and go straight to X series, but know you're no longer getting the best latest greatest from Sony with the Xperia Xs. Wish I had better news, but I'm struggling with upgrade choices as well."
"This phone is worthless, I have factory reset it several times since I got it and it's still giving me problems."
Works great!
Made a great gift for her. It has the best camera in market with a beautiful display.
"I waited a loooooong time for this phone. It was finally released. Great specs and all, and worked perfectly for the first 5 months. All of a sudden, it started shutting down at least twice a week. And finally I tried to make a call and it's completely dead. I have tried all means and resources available online to restart this phone, but TO NO AVAIL! Sucks!!! $900 down the drain. I'll just return to my ever faithful HTC brand and never go back to sony"
Brillaint
"The battery life retention is zero; you have to charge the phone all the time, even when you are not using it. It is a waste of my hard earned money."
"The phone""was promised ""water resistant""somehow just by rising it, the screen was blacked out. yeah..... just some fancy rhetoric."
"Faulty product. Gets overheated when I got ut and now it starts to restart the system automatically. The battery only stands for 3 hours. My friend got one from another place and his works perfectly. So I think it's this seller selling the faulty products. The phone is mailed from hk, not JP."
"I've been excited waiting to buy this phone and i finally did. It has exceeded my expectations! Its incredibly fast, the fingerprint scanner works seamlessly, and with the bundled quick charger filling up the already long lasting battery is a breeze! Low light pictures could be better but I'm not at all disappointed. My only complaint is that playing more demanding games tends to cause the phone to get a little toasty for my likings."
"I know its sold without warranty(international sale) but i thought it would last longer, not three months. Bought it for my son as a Christmas present but is already in a drawer with a burned screen. :-("
I loved this device. Only problem right now is that it won't charge OR turn on anymore.
Awesome phone does everything and the camera and screen are great and everything works perfect
"Best phone I ever had!!Beautiful, fast and sexy!"
"although the battery does not last long, as they say."
Buen producto
When I plug in my headphones they dont work.
"Absolutely best android phone! Don't listen to the haters here, most likely user error!"
"Nice smartphone, get heat a little like other phones, just the battery life is not longer that the previous version, but it's a good smartphone. 4k recorder consume to much battery and resources. The only fault in the phone."
It is the wrong model but is OK.
"Not very good, is accessible for cost and quality"
"Super sexy, feels great in the hand...however, upon inserting SIM and turning on, a software update loaded, and now my contacts, and ability to dial a number, do not work! WTH?"
"I don't know why it was opened when I get it. The ups package was good. Also, the system language was already set with Chinese."
3 month's and phone is dead unbelievable...
Best phone I ever had fast clean and beautiful display 4k video is amazing no over heating issues. water proof and almost all apps can be uninstalled.. lite and battery last 2 days before charge under normal use.
Is not useful
"probably one of the best cellphone ever used, even it's over a year old, still performs on par with new phones that came out now, holds a very good battery life, although these days with Pokemon Go no phone can hold it's battery, but before that, can go 2 days without charging on a regular use, definitely last through a whole day.screen is big enough, phone feels very classy, water proof definitely a plus. even as Sony release the X Performance, i would still use this, other than the camera, there are no real performance upgrade from the Z5P to the XP."
"This is a great phone - I quite enjoy the Sony line exclusively. The sound volume is less than par but different features more than make up what thia phone lacks. Definitely enjoy the fast processor, screen display as well as functionality. Beautifully made and perfectly engineered."
"This is not a good phone as far as running application and taking photos, and the battery life is excellent. But damn this thing is brittle, I don't put cases on my phones which was a huge mistake with this phone.I have had this phone for 3 months and already with normal wear and tear there are multiple visible scratches on the back and one on the glass on front of the phone. I have no idea how it got any of these scratches and non of my previous phones ever got a scratch on the glass. So now I don't know if it is waterproof as I don't know how deep the scratches go, and waterproof was a main quality when picking this phone.Also the Bluetooth is very sporadic when hooking to my car sometimes it works flawlessly other times I have to turn off the Bluetooth and turn it back on and resync with my car. Sometimes i have to do this multiple times. my previous phone didn't have this problem, the worse part about this is that it will play the audio through the phone which is muted so my audio books are playing in the background without me realizing it.There is also a Phantom touch that occurs on the top left randomly. so the menu on top will drop and raise and drop and raise. This is usually fixed by rubbing the top left of the phone but still annoying.The fingerprint scanner works about 40% of the time for no apparent reason.And the double tap to view screen is severely broken. This is the feature where double tapping the screen performs the same action as the power button. I had to disable this feature as it being in my pocket would randomly turn on the screen and just mash the dial buttons.On the plus side, it runs applications fairly well when I don't get the phantom touching going on and it hasn't butt dialed the cops yet. This is my first Sony phone and I probably will not be getting another one. Again this is all the things I have experienced in just 3 short months."
"This phone overheat so much that you can not hold it in your hand,"
Absolutely AWESOME
"This was supposed to be the best phone ever. So far very disappointed and looking at some of my friends' phones I should've gone for Samsung. Camera sucks, the pictures are low quality compared to iPhone and Samsung. When recording video after less than a minute the cellphone heats up too much and just aborts recording due to heat, as ridiculous as it sounds. I carry with me a second cellphone (a cheap Samsung), both on t-mobile and the other phone has far much better signal all the time. This phone even struggles at times to find signal. I take really good care of this phone and now the headphones plug stopped working. Screen seems to have a false contact now and blinks all the time, making it extremely uncomfortable and annoying.Such a shame and disappointment. I might finally switch to iPhone or back to Galaxy. Good bye Sony."
"Robert here...I got my Z5 Premium this past Sunday and thus far, I absolutely LOVE this phone. After doing much research, I picked the single sim International version as it has capacity for faster download. I'm really impressed with the sound quality of this piece. I'd been using an old Droid3 as my Mp3 player and using a cheap ZTE Maven as my communicator with Cricket service. I had to take it to a Cricket store to get the mini sim cut to nano size (free). Being an E6853 vs the E6883, the product registration site wouldn't allow me to register so I had to call. It turns out mine was originally set for the Panamanian market. The young lady I spoke with, Alice, was very helpful with getting me set up for my 1 yr warranty.I chose the gold color and it is so beautiful. It's such a shame I have to cover it up with a TUDIA Slim-Fit MERGE case. The case actually is very nice though. I am really afraid of damaging this thing.I chose the Z5 Premium mostly for it's music handling prowess. This thing must have some Walkman genes in it. I think I found a replacement for my Zune with the cracked screen. I've read some iffy reviews regarding the fingerprint scanner but' I've not had any problem with it at all. It does not work when you first power up the phone and that's by design. The volume button location is a bit kooky but, I can get used to that. It seems a bit slow to sync with MediaPlayer. I'm gonna try and use a faster port. I've also heard of people complaining about a lack of image stability. Mine has it and it works very well. One cool thing I found with this being an unlocked phone is I'm able to use tethering on USB/Bluetooth and WiFi HotSpot with no restrictions.This is going to be a rolling review as I gain more experience with it so, I will update later.Update: 08/09/2016I've had my phone shut down/reboot on me twice. Both times it had been in my front jeans pocket. I bet it overheated and went into protection. Thinking back now, I wonder if this is why I've had so much trouble with my android phones. I've had them reboot on me before and this Xperia Z5 Premium is the first one that's performed the same after. I think I like that. I'm still going to work on that pocket thing though. Everything else is perfect so far."
"Switched from iPhone's iOS to Android and thought I'd try Sony's Z5, best decision ever! The phone arrived in 2 business days, put on the extra screen protector and an ultra-thin case (both purchased through Amazon), switched my SIM card over and it worked right out of the box. I noticed later that I wasn't able to setup Exchange mail for my work and the solution was to take it in to my carrier i.e. TMobile and have them enter their setup/configuration in the phone and this fixed all other lingering issues (as far as communication is concerned). The resolution on this thing is out of this world (I didn't realize it had a 4K screen until colleagues and friends who looked at the display marveled at the sharp and crisp display).I'm still getting used to Android 5.0 though (6 is not available for this phone yet, but soon is the rumor). I haven't found a push to talk button, but installed Dragon and it somewhat works like Siri.So far, the phone is a beast, worth every penny. The charger though takes forever to charger, I purchased an additional Sony charger on Amazon: OEM Sony Micro USB Charger (EP880+EC803) and this charges the phone much faster so maybe the Z5 shipped with a cheaper charger, I don't know.Anyway, I'm happy with this phone and purchased additional memory in case I need it,"
Awesome phone couldn't ask for better battery life and performance.
"Very good replacement of Z3, didn't get any overheating issue at all. But you need to change some settings to connect to ATT data network. This is Taiwan version of Z5P, so the 4G is equivalent to US LTE. Sony Z6 won't go out until Q3 this year, so Z5 could fill the embarrassing gap between."
Like :)
specs are as described. I am loving my new phone
"Great phone so far. I had it for one day so I can't write a review in detail. I can summarize...beautiful, very classy and elegant design, snappy, great screen....UNIQUE...different from all the iPhones and samsungs out there. love it. Great job Sony"
"Putting the 4K feature aside the phone is a huge improvement from the Xperia Z3. It's far more responsive, camera is greatly improved. Also Don't has finally decided to get rid of the port covers except for the one where the SIM and microSDcard go in but that isn't an issue because it won't ever be opened. I can't say anything about the 4K screen because there isn't much content but that wasn't why I bought the phone."
My phone dies in under 2 hours and Sony support will not help me at all and my wifi does not work correctly and the aux port also does not work correctly at all. Do not buy this phone.
Awesome Phone
The phone doesn't work properly. It gets hot all the time because of the new processor. Finger print sensor doesn't work my fingerprint and i have to change my finger and i have to use the pin code every two or three times. I don't have signal sometimes. No LTE service!! just 4G not always though. Touch screen doesn't work sometimes and .....It might be a good phone but not with the providers here in the US. when I checked the return policy it referred me to the Amazon return policy but the seller sent me an email to let me know there will be 20% restocking fee for opened items plus the shipping fee.I paid $790 and in this case i will have to pay $158 + shipping fee!!I was a big fan but not anymore. I am disappointed with this phone and this seller.
Jack for headphone has some problems
"lots of space, speedier than predecessor and phenominal performance, no lag downloading, processing or streaming content, great product."
Nice phone
excelent
"Excellent picture and good volume on the speaker. I'm hooked on the Sony products! Camera takes great pictures, even in low light. Love it!"
The phone works and looks awesome!
"Let me start off by saying this phone is breathtaking, from the head turning design to the 3840 x 2160 resolution screen.-A few thoughts-Display: Before this phone I have never seen 4K resolution before with my own eyes so I only could imagine what it'll look like. Coming from my former Sony Xperia™ Z3 Dual I could always record video in 4K but never could see it because what the smartphone displayed was only 1920 x 1080P (1080p) so after receiving this phone and after downloading a few 4K videos and photos I can say I was not disappointed one bit it actually far pass my expectations! Colors pop, blacks are true and the Triluminos / X-Reaility technology brings it all together.Design: just got this Smartphone and already countless compliments, glass front and back the back isn't just ""mirror like"" it is a mirror! Which I find very useful when taking a 23mp selfie but it'll grab up fingerprints like crazy I find my self having to clean it off a few times a day but it's not a problem for me becuase I always clean my phones repeatedly anyways. The chrome framework is amazing and I love they put the two front facing speakers back on the edge of the screen like they used to have it in the Sony Xperia™ Z2 models very simplistic. I didn't not like the two speaker placements on the Z3 models, on the bottom left side you'll find a laser cut (Xperia) logo and 2 thumbs up for keeping the lanyard/charm part in the design!Features: Sony Xperia™ Z5 Premium is the Smartphone I decided to get over all the other premium Smartphones is because it offers so much more for my needs that the others simply just doesn't. Being able to turn on my PlayStation 4 from anywhere and play my games with a Dualshock 4 controller and play all my console games on the go is great. Holding the power button to show the (Record Screen) Option and livestream my gameplay right off my phone with no added application is good all on the WORLDS FIRST 5.5in 4K display. I've tested a lot of highly graphical games on here and it is a huge improvement over my old Z3 Dual, games run great! Have never overheated once. I gamed for over 8hrs and the battery life is so good, but watching videos a lot can drop the battery life pretty quick I'm guessing becuase it will upscale 1080P resolution to 1260P.Overall the shipping was fast the packaging was great in the box I got a pair of standard Sony earbuds, USB/Micro USB cable, wall adapter (not quick charge 2.0 which the phone do support), booklets. I have no complaints."
I love this phone its super fast and the chrome is so nice just get it. Side note for those like me that have T-MOBILE IT DOES HAVE FULL 4G LTE do not put the APN settings by your self there is an option to DOWNLOAD INTERNET SETTINGS if you do this you will get LTE if you put them in your self you will just get HSPA+. Hope this helps.
"Crashed in less than a month. No warranty means I'm out $700, and assurion only wants to give me a S4 as a replacement. Buy something from your carrier and don't try and be fancy."
"Purchased March 10 and died April 14!!!!!!!!!!! This is the first time I've ever bought a phone (without a carrier subsidy from a contract obligation), and this phone won't power on after powering it off (with 20% battery left). None of the recommendations I've found online to power on this phone will work! So much money WASTED!!!!!!!!!"
I love my new xperia z5 premium!
"I had a Samsung note 4, this Xperia Z5 Premium is way better. More powerful, nice pictures with the 23mp camera."
Wonderfull Phone i love it is reallu nice
I've had two z3 phones and now the z5 and they are not a durable phone every phone I've owned from Sony has shattered the features and picture quality is awesome . Its fast just not a durable phone if you are rough on phones
"Ordered my z5 premium chrome through universal goods, the phone got here fast I ordered it on a Friday and it got here the following Friday. Everything was new in its package and well protected with bubble wrap in the box. I have had the phone for about 2 weeks and so far I am extremely happy with it. My last 2 phones have been iPhones and this phone is far better in every aspect. I've seen reviews of people complaining about the finger print scanner but I have not had any problems yet its extremely responsive to the touch. Also since I had read those reviews I simply used two Id fingerprint scanners for the same finger so that might have helped. Overall it's an amazing phone, great image display, sound, function and quality. I never realized until now how greatly underrated Sony phones have been."
Great solid phone!
"This phone is amazing, Sony really created a good product. I believe it's the best android phone you can get now, specially 4K camera and display. The only unfortunately thing is the battery capacity."
"It Is a great phone, it met all my expectations. I was a little confused with the card, it uses a nano sim card, but I went to my carrier and they cutted it and helped me set up the Internet connection LTE. I have been using it for almost a week, so far, so good. The fingerprint sensor works well. Camera Is amazing, took some pictures and videos and I just love them."
It's just great.!
"It glides on almost every surface...One day i was laying down on concrete floor and my phone slid off my pocket and fell about 3-4 inches before it hit the ground and cracked the screen. BE WARNED, it will slide off of metal, wood and plastic and will brake easily."
Chinese
Love it! :3
Awesome device. Best clarity I've ever seen on a phone.
Not bad
very good phone. the only issue is the battery that don't last long. only a day.
"This is my first ever Android Phone, having used BlackBerry since 2009. So most of my ""problems"" are just learning a new User Interface / Operating System (I'd have that problem regardless of what Android or Apple phone I switched to).One feature I didn't think I'd use is the fingerprint scanner. This scanner is accurate and trouble free. I love it. Compared to my wife's Note 5, it feels like a next generation technology (I don't tell her that). The USA Version of the regular Z5 has deleted this option. Big mistake, I'd get the international version of the Z5 regardless if I was getting the Premium or not. It's a very cool scanner, very impressed with the technology.I saw a few reviews saying that LTE doesn't work - it does. It doesn't display ""4GTLE"" it only displays ""4G"" but rest assured you're on LTE. I took a screenshot of a speed test using T-Mobile, USA but AT&T is also a GSM carrier and this phone has the bands for it as well.OK, I love the screen. I know that OLED is all the rage these days but I love this LCD screen because it can dim low in a dark room and can get very bright. The auto sensor works great on this phone too. The screen is beautiful.The camera is great! Coming from BlackBerry which always used subpar crappy cameras, I admit anything would have been an improvement but it takes great photos in line with my wife's Note 5 (probably better but we won't tell her).The front stereo speakers are fine. They are not as loud as one or two out there but are louder and clearer than many if not most.I love that it's water resistant.It looks beautiful. I got the Chrome but since I'm afraid to carry it naked and put a minimal transparent case on it, I'm wondering if I shouldn't have gone with the Gold. Any color choice is beautiful.As far as the 4K - The stock 4K video by Sony does look great but so does anything I'm viewing on here. I'd base my choice between Z5 or Z5 Premium based on what you prefer in phone size and screen size rather than 4K or not.I used to love BlackBerry because I liked carrying something different (they are very rare these days in the US) and I like this phone for the same reason. Everyone has either an Apple or a Samsung - but this Sony is something different. I really like it and recommend it.I intend on updating this review at the start of 2017 to give an update on how it works long term. But the initial quality is outstanding."
"Phone is horrible. Sticks for over 10 mins, randomly. Screen turns black and you cant see incoming calls. I have no added features, apps, or covers on phone. Constantly having to reset phone. All this happens within 37 days of ownership. Seller..Mobile front...wont even respond or reply. Run from this product and seller."
This phone is greatBattery last daysScreen is hugeResolution is amazingOnly problem I came upon was the fact that whenever I made a call or received one my screen would go black. Now the call would be fine but thier was no way of me ending the call or multi task on my phone while I made the call.Everything els works great though!
"Wooow, what a cell phone. I was clearly hesitating. But I think I made a right one.Nothing to say about it"
"Awesome phone, super fast shipping, great price"
awesome phone
Amazing. Best phone i ever owned. From samsung to htc. This one kills them all. Minor issue with tmobile setting up the phone other then that it is amazing..Great battery life. quick to charge. stunning display. This is the best phone! Ashamed that Sony does not push the market and let's apple and samsung. They simply do not compare.Only issue is that i cannot use remote play without wifi :( my carrier network is strong enough. Maybe a setting I'm missing.
"Broken after not even a month of use. Power button//finger print scanner defective. The phone just died on me, and I had to pay for it to be repaired, since there is no warranty. You are better off getting a Samsung of an Iphone for the cost. Please, please, please, don't purchase unless you wanna pay for expensive repairs."
too heavy
"only shop the U.S. if you are in the U.S. Return hassle, the camera doesn't work and the phone keeps freezing."
This thing was an amazing phone 'til it just died for no reason. No warranty on US and you couldn't use the 4k other than playing back your own recorded videos. So pass on this and get a US warranty Z5 or XZ even though they don't have finger print scanner. I keep mine unlocked with my heartrate monitor
"I've had this phone for almost a year. I use it on the T-Mobile network and the LTE works great. The camera is great! The screen is only 4k if you are looking at pictures in the Albums app and the default sony video player. The battery life is great as long as you don't keep needless features on while not using them. The waterproofing is great, I've washed the phone in the shower several times and it has not failed. I think it is funny that other brands are just now water proofing their phones, Sony is way ahead of the curve in that aspect. The power button integrated finger print scanner is a nice touch,so you don't always have to enter an unlock code. Overall the phone is great and I waited almost a year just to write a review because I really wanted to thoroughly use and test the phone."
"The phone is for two SIM cards and buy (and I came out more expensive) model is a single SIM card since this model has better performance. I request that I return the difference in the money they charged me for more between the two models, because I feel cheated. Thank you."
"This should be a great phone, with a bright sharp screen and the ip86 rating but it is almost unusable due to the constant reboots it goes through. After searching online, it seems that this is a common issue for the z5. No issues with the seller, for what it's worth."
Very good
"Would gave it a 4, but I ordered chrome and got black."
"Great phone. Beautiful build, top of the line hardware and screen but Do Not bring this anywhere near water."
excelent !!!
"Came brand new, came in Chinese automatically, but easily changed to English, just wish it had delivery options, but the product is excellent!"
Amazing piece of hardware couldn't be happier
"I've been using this phone for a couple of days now, and after watching, reading, and hearing all these reviews as well as feedback from others, I had an idea of what to expect going into purchasing this device.I saw a few have issues with the phone bending, similar to the iPhone 6 Plus when that first released. I've been babying it and taking care of the phone as much as possible, and in that time I've fallen in love. My personal experience is the UI is nice and clean, similar to stock Android with a few added extras, and it's very responsive. I know it's not 4K all the time, and until the Marshmallow update releases, there won't be much support as of yet, however the up scaling of videos in the YouTube app still look simply amazing. The camera isn't really want most hyped it up to be, but I find that it works well and edges out my Note 4 and my father's iPhone 6S Plus, which is perfect enough for me.From the general feel of the build quality, I'd have to mark Sony down as the ""Apple"" of Androids, since I haven't personally felt that the other Android devices did it for me. I tried the Note 5, S6 Edge Plus, iPhone 6S Plus, Nexus 6P, and multiple others, but the Xperia takes the cake in feeling the most premium to me. Calls sound crystal clear, and the front facing speakers, while not as powerful as some HTC or Motorola phones, still sound much better than my previous iPhone.All in all, love the device, hope Sony continues to push out updates for it in the future, and I may stick with them should they continue producing this type of quality into their devices."
"Awesome phone, but after a few months of use, definitely a bit too big for me. Might go down to the regular version instead. 4k screen shows zero difference vs other screens."
"Cool Gadget. A beauty to behold...Expensive? Yes but its still worth the hype. Finger Print scanner on the Power key is fast and responsive every timeBattery Life is not exactly 48hrs but i keep everything on so i cant really benchmark.to achieve two days battery life, you have to enter stamina and ultra stamina mode which really turns the phone into a dumb large phone since you'll have to give up all the cool smart features for a very reduced battery consumption. the battery barely discharges if it is inactive and that gives me a comfort feel that i wont loose charge when the device is not in use"
"I have been switching from a phone to another for a while and the last phone I got was the Nexus 6P. I tried LG, Motorola, Samsung, HTC, iPhone, and Nexus 6P. I never gave Sony a chance, because I haven't seen them doing any major advertisements so I assumed it isn't a great phone. When I used the phone, I regret not buying Sony phones before. The phone is so user friendly and so clean of a software, even better than the pure Android like the ones, which comes in Nexus lineup.Basically you are buying quality !! a product that is well build and carefully crafted, and the software is perfectly modified.The only thing I don't like is the finger prints left on the back of the phone and the lack of the number of cases available to purchase.Update: Sadly I returned the phone, because I was getting Black Screen of Death during my calls. I can't do anything when I get it until the person I am talking to hang up then the screen turn back on. I tried all the fixes, but none of them worked, so I ended up returning it. I liked the phone so much, but I don't want to risk buying a phone that has a common issue since the Z2."
"This phone are really amazing!!! I purchase the phone trough Quality Deals Shop Center and for my surprise the phone came with the UCH10 Quick Charger and an amazing headphones. like ever, Sony make the best smartphones. the camera is really amazing, I'm impressed because the quality is superior from others high ended phones. the phone is simply beautiful and it looks PREMIUM. The fingerprint scanner works really amazing, much better than iphone 6s and galaxy S6. the screen is GORGEOUS, I can't explain it in words. the stereo speakers sounds very clear and super cool, but my old Xperia Z2 sounds a little louder than Z5 Premium. the led light is situated in the corner of the phone and is very small, for me, the led light of my old Z2 looks a lot better than this, positioned in the superior speaker and it was much larger than the Z5 one.The battery life is AMAZING and the quick charger works excelent, the phone charges completely in 1 hour approximately."
This is something worth getting !!!
The phone worked great for under a year and then the antenna broke and I couldn't get a signal from the cellular network anymore.
Excelente
Excellent product!!!!
"xperia line has never disappointed me and the z5 after a few month is my favorite up to date, I'm thinking of getting the xz soon."
"I bought my Z5 Premium From The Wireless Circle and it's a Singapore version if you want to know. It works well. No sign of being a dud like China's. Fingerprint scanner is good and fast. No sign of overheating or getting hotter than normal. Works with ultra mobile which are my services. Overall I definitely like it better than the Z5. I'm sure it'll work well playing remote play with the Ps4 and ps1, gba and all the other emulators just like the Z5. Camera quality really is good and so is 4k recording. Very stable and steady and I love it. Took the risk of ordering international since I don't trust China. But Singapore is doing me well :) no regrets."
Good
My favorite phone so far. Sony rules Samsung sux.
"Within a month the phone started acting up, phone jacks kept reading as if it was plugging in and out every half a second. Phone's unusable now, money down the drain for me. Steer clear and get another Xperia model."
"I love this Phone. Even today I like it I am tempted to get a new Sony Phone but they aren't making them with the 4k Screen so I have declined to upgrade as of yet. The Camera is great. Remember Sony uses a full size pocket camera sensors in their phones they work great. Plus it is Water/Dirt/Dust Proof. I have taken it in the pool and at the beach, no problems. Just washed it off wit tap water after going into salt water."
"Probably the best phone in the US that no one has heard of unless you're a phone geek. I've had to work with phones for 10 years in the cellular industry and have seen many phones come and go. I have loved the recent Xperia series from Sony and always believe that they deliver the best products. In terms of phones, it's no secret that Sony has had a rocky history to say the least (Sony Ericsson partnership and a myriad of failures).I'll try and keep this short, but at least provide some more of a detailed review. Feel free to check the other versions of Z5 Premium (Chrome and Black) for others, but I notice the Gold version is sorely lacking any thorough review so here go:I've been using this phone for about month and don't typically review anything until I have had a chance to use it for more than a few days. First impressions can be misleading, so I let myself download apps, use throughout the day, take pictures, videos, etc and get a feel for the phone. I will say I have used a few other Xperias before. I am jumping from a Xperia Z1 I purchased in Japan about 2 years ago and loved that phone as well. Probably some Sony fanboy-ish going on here, but I will try and be as neutral as possible.Performance of the phone is fantastic. Everything moves very quick and smooth. Responds very well overall. One of my favorite features (yes it's nothing new, but performs so so well) is the fingerprint scanner. Like I said, I have worked in the cellular industry and I know the iPhone first brought this to the mainstream but I've really found myself using the fingerprint scanner a lot and the fact that the phone is larger, the scanner is actually a much easier way to unlock the screen than sliding up the unlock motion. And again, it just works so smooth!Perhaps my favorite part of this phone, and a big purchasing decision, is the camera. I have two little ones and whenever the family is out, I am typically default camera man, so there was a lot of debate with the wife as to whether I should invest in a good DSLR camera or buy the loaded Z5P phone. I haven't regretted my decision as the Z5P takes beautiful pictures, 23MP, though I find myself using the 20MP 16:9 format and even the Premium Auto mode is great for taking quick shots (using the quick wake up mode). Yes, it does take 4K video, which looks unbelievable. And Sony does have a little snapshot tool to take 8MP screenshots of 4K video stills if you so desire. The 4K SCREEN ON THE PHONE looks phenomenal. I've read a lot of tech sites instantly saying that the 4K screen is unnecessary and a gimmick, however to be honest, I'm not sure what screen they're looking at. I've put up the Z5P screen next to my Z1 (1080p) and for me personally I can definitely tell a difference. The Z5P is so much clearer and the colors are very vibrant (though not overly saturated). Also, the camera has a 1080p/60fps video mode which also works great. Lastly, the camera has an insanely fast autofocus, which does actually autofocus, which helps with quickshots. Again, camera alone was worth the purchase.Battery: Always a touchy issue with so many and always the quickest to get people to stop buying your product. With heavy usage, and again, from experience, I know what constitutes heavy, you can still EASILY get a days worth of usage on your phone. I have tried several times to intentionally kill my battery doing things that typically kill other phones instantly--biggies being streaming video, games, GPS, camera and the often under-appreciated phone calls/video(data) calls. I don't think people really know how much phone calls kill your battery, but again, tried to get it to under a day and it didn't really work. I would still have about 20% at the end (say 9-10pm) of the day. Now again, I don't have the luxury of literally sitting down from 8am-8pm doing nothing but that, but throughout the day, I would watch/play/listen/etc and still had enough battery to do more by the time I put the kids to bed. Also, the last few days I've been trying something else and seeing how the battery preserves itself. During work, I don't heavily use my phone (because, you know, I'm WORKING), but even at that with 2 email accounts synced up, and other various services running (mind you, no facebook, twitter or other SNS-sorry no social life :) I still do some messaging but still have about 80% at the end of day. I DO NOT charge the phone overnight, lose a couple more percentages and start day 2 with about 75-78%. I then continue to work again and continue to drain battery and again still have a moderate (about 65%) battery. Now again, by no means am I saying this is an end-all guide to the 5-day battery phone, but again, for practical usage for people who don't live on their phones 24/7 I can easily get 3 working days of usage on my phone, maybe 4 if I push it. Again many factors go into this, screen brightness, accounts, etc. but I have been thrilled with my battery life.Ok, I'm rambling too much so I'll wrap it up. Quickly wanted to address a negative:Bezel--never understood why people think this phone has larger bezels than others. I think there was someone who actually measured the % of screen that the bezels take up and Xperias actually have a better % than iPhones and some others. Now one thing I will note is the 3 touch buttons (back, home and apps) are taking up part of the 5.5"" screen. While others, like Samsung have the buttons underneath so you get a true full screen. Anyway, minor design gripe, but still more than enough real estate on the screen.Little extra here too, again, read about how some people thought it was such a novelty that the phone was water/dust proof rated yet kept the charging port open. If you have experience with Japanese phones, you probably know that waterproofing phones is very old news. Almost all Japanese phone manufacturers, Sony, Sharp, Kyocera, make all their phones waterproof because many Japanese take their phones in the bath with them. In fact, my wife has a basic Sharp Aquos from about 2-2 1/2 years ago that is also waterproof, but already had the open charging port design implemented. Again, just a little tidbit there about the novelty of waterproofing phones, so yes the charging port is open, but the phone is still sealed. I also can attest to this as I have used the phone for pictures in not only heavy rainfall but also at a waterpark (my little girl drenched my phone but totally fine).Alright, I'm done now. Hopefully this helped out and if you purchase it, ENJOY!"
"My brother loves his phone,he is a sony xperia person so i expected he would love it"
"When it came to my door you best believe I opened it faster than the rubiks cube wr. Great phone, quickcharge, earbuds, can play your ps4 on it without losing progress from the tv and loads more. If you have the money and are looking for a unique experience then get this. Also chrome is always the way to go. A definite brgging right to be able to say "" My phones chrome and is waterproof."" I've talked long enough. 10/10"
Good
"I bought one and when I turn it on it works okay but the apps were inChineese. Also it would not pick up on a 4G LTE.. I went for it because it specified it was an international version but it did not meet its specification, so I had to return it. Sony has to improve on the 4G LTE. It does not work. I'll go for a galaxy Note"
Excellent
"Sony Xperia phones are great. Never bought an Apple, never thought following the crowd was the best way to go. Dollar to Dollar, Sony beats Apple. Waterproof, scratch resistant, and fingerprints don't really show unless you really got greasy ones, fantastic display, great sound quality. I just found it a bit big to hold in my palm, and the volume toggle is not well placed as many have complained about....so why doesn't Sony change it? 4K pics are great and so is the camera, but don't think it's as good as a ""regular"" camera with a bigger lens. Plus, buildings and tress may ""bend"" a bit depending on your picture angle which is kinda like a cheaper point and shoot. But, then again, it's a very small lens and so you will get some grainy pictures as well regardless of the megapixels."
great product!
BE AWARE... No LTE FOR AT&T for this phone which is not good and problems with screen...there is sometimes when I try to press the left top corner or the right top corner and it's not responding..... When I shut it off and turn it back on then it works..... I think these are refurbished phones and I made a big mistake by buying a phone from Internet..... WITH NO WARRANTY....
"A great phone that delivers as promised. Excellent photo quality, very fast focussing, and adequate low light photo ability are some of the great features. The battery life is astounding. It feels as a true high quality, luxury product that you can proudly carry and have people ask you inquisitively what phone you are using as it's doubtful that they have ever seen any Sony XPeria series phone. A+"
I used 8month already broken no warranty
T-mobile:Phone was delivered within the week.(standard delivery)All features work as expectedGreat looking phone with premium feelWould recommend to anyone.If you have used or owned a previous Xperia series phone this phone is a big step up
"i have been a long term xperia fan ever since i first purchases the z1 (honami) a few years ago. Now that i ahev the z5 premium i must say that i am extremely happy with this phone. the clarity of photos and video are quite amazing for a phone. and the waterproofing makes for some added fun as well when i take this phone surfing and wait for a nice wave i just watch videos or listen to music. and the battery life is extrememly good as long as you have the right settings and with stamina mode you can easily double the time you use it.now there are some things to mention since this is an international phone it is not capable of 4G, but it capable of LTE which is good because LTE is actually faster. if you want a 4G phone (slower data speed) then this is not the phone for you. Be sure to set up your mobile network and to download internet and mms setting in the settings because only idiots forget to do that and you're not an idiot... or are you?"
i love my new phone sony xperia z5 premium is really outstanding
"The Sony Xperia Z5 premium phone is one that will certainly get people's attention.It is stylish, it is a beast of a phone, and above all, it is everything you would expect from a premium Sony phone.I love a lot of things on my Z5 premium. Some are great upgrades from my previous phone, the Z1.This is just personal preferences, but I liked the Walkman App before it turned to the Android Lollipop Music App.Lollipop is just not type. I will probably revert to KitKat because I love the UI and overall feel better than Lollipop's.The power button is slightly sunken. Unlike the Z1, where it was easily accessible with a slightly outward button.Lastly, and yes, this is was shocking for me as well. The screen.With a whopping 806 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) 4K screen, you would expect the display quality to be as clear as looking out a window. So unless I bought a faulty phone, I kid you not, the screen looks pixelated. Yes, you read that right. Pixelated.Now, I know that everything except the Album and Video apps are down-scaled to 1080P. So I tested the 4K photos and videos, and to my astonishment, there they are! Still looking pixelated, even at 4K. I had to look through a magnifying glass to see them up close. I compared my old Z1, my dad's Z Ultra and the Z5 Premium. Again big surprise, both my old Z1 and the Z ultra pixels can barely be seen, with very faint black lines separating the pixels, while on the Z5 Premium the lines were considerably much more noticeable.Looking at all three phones from a normal distance, the Z1 and Z Ultra's screens do not look pixelated at all, while my Z5, even from a fair distance, you can still faintly see the pixelation.Basically, I have phone with a 4K display, but it almost makes me feel like it has a WVGA display.Lastly, I've never seen a phone reflect dots from a turned off display before. My Z5 Premium for some reason reflects dots, pixels, I don't know what they are in a squared grid pattern whenever the screen reflects light. Whether its from the Sun or any regular light, you will clearly see them. Regardless if whether the phone is on or not.Conclusion.The phone itself is awesome. Great new features, great audio, superb built quality and respectable camera.It might just be my phone, its too early to tell, since a lot people don't own this phone yet, but make sure to check with others who own the phone and ask if they see pixelation or have a faulty displays in their Z5 Premium as well.[[ASIN:B0171GYNGW Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (CHROME) - International Stock No Warranty]"
"The best phone ever! Beauty, fast anf anothers goods..."
"So far this is the best phone I have ever owned. I'm coming from a Galaxy Note 3 due to the Note 5 not having expandable storage and disappointing me in almost every aspect.First off, after using this phone I immediately fell in love with the waterproof feature. I will never buy another phone that doesn't have resistance to water, I mean honestly the technology is there, if the big companies cant get on the train and get this feature I will simply stay away. I also was able to easily expand my storage by 128gb with a micro SD. The 4K display is something I could live without but it is a nice feature and I can't complain. Battery life is very good for this device I am able to fall asleep with 40% battery from a day of moderate use, wake up and use the phone till mid afternoon with no problems. Charging is pretty fast also. I can leave the phone and forget about it for about an hour and come back to a ton of battery life.I removed a star for the fingerprint scanner getting a slight scratch within the first month of use and rendering it un-usable. Would be nice to use it but not a whole lot I can do about it. I think the next phone I will get will have to have usb type c with super high speed data transfer. We shall see what the future holds."
Amazing smartphone. Out of this world screen and terrific camera. It looks like no other and everybody will ask about it.
"Pros: Unique, Worth the money, Excellent, Powerful device!Cons: No Warrenty for International Stock :/"
Very good my sister love it
"Switched from iPhone's iOS to Android and thought I'd try Sony's Z5, best decision ever! The phone arrived in 2 business days, put on the extra screen protector and an ultra-thin case (both purchased through Amazon), switched my SIM card over and it worked right out of the box. I noticed later that I wasn't able to setup Exchange mail for my work and the solution was to take it in to my carrier i.e. TMobile and have them enter their setup/configuration in the phone and this fixed all other lingering issues (as far as communication is concerned). The resolution on this thing is out of this world (I didn't realize it had a 4K screen until colleagues and friends who looked at the display marveled at the sharp and crisp display).I'm still getting used to Android 5.0 though (6 is not available for this phone yet, but soon is the rumor). I haven't found a push to talk button, but installed Dragon and it somewhat works like Siri.So far, the phone is a beast, worth every penny. The charger though takes forever to charger, I purchased an additional Sony charger on Amazon: OEM Sony Micro USB Charger (EP880+EC803) and this charges the phone much faster so maybe the Z5 shipped with a cheaper charger, I don't know.Anyway, I'm happy with this phone and purchased additional memory in case I need it,"
Awesome phone couldn't ask for better battery life and performance.
"Very good replacement of Z3, didn't get any overheating issue at all. But you need to change some settings to connect to ATT data network. This is Taiwan version of Z5P, so the 4G is equivalent to US LTE. Sony Z6 won't go out until Q3 this year, so Z5 could fill the embarrassing gap between."
Like :)
specs are as described. I am loving my new phone
"Great phone so far. I had it for one day so I can't write a review in detail. I can summarize...beautiful, very classy and elegant design, snappy, great screen....UNIQUE...different from all the iPhones and samsungs out there. love it. Great job Sony"
"Putting the 4K feature aside the phone is a huge improvement from the Xperia Z3. It's far more responsive, camera is greatly improved. Also Don't has finally decided to get rid of the port covers except for the one where the SIM and microSDcard go in but that isn't an issue because it won't ever be opened. I can't say anything about the 4K screen because there isn't much content but that wasn't why I bought the phone."
My phone dies in under 2 hours and Sony support will not help me at all and my wifi does not work correctly and the aux port also does not work correctly at all. Do not buy this phone.
Awesome Phone
The phone doesn't work properly. It gets hot all the time because of the new processor. Finger print sensor doesn't work my fingerprint and i have to change my finger and i have to use the pin code every two or three times. I don't have signal sometimes. No LTE service!! just 4G not always though. Touch screen doesn't work sometimes and .....It might be a good phone but not with the providers here in the US. when I checked the return policy it referred me to the Amazon return policy but the seller sent me an email to let me know there will be 20% restocking fee for opened items plus the shipping fee.I paid $790 and in this case i will have to pay $158 + shipping fee!!I was a big fan but not anymore. I am disappointed with this phone and this seller.
It has dual chip
The camera does not work after an update and I would have to send the phone back to Taiwan to get it repaired. Total waste of $$
I liked.
Just Perfect... One of the Best Mobile Phones
"This phone is excellent, good screen, battery duration is superior to any computer on the market.Apart from the above performance it is very fast has a heat sink does not hot, but it requires a lot at stake and others.The only thing against you find is that some specimens come, that does not work for Jack 3.5, and my case mine does not work, opt to solve the problem by buying bluetooth headphones."
Thicker than expected. Specs are not good as its price. Accessories boxes are bigger than its needed during shipping it moves a lot.
This is my third SONY phone. Excellent !!! I love this Phone! Everything works on it just fine. I have ATT as carrier i live in the US. Took it to ATT when i received it they put a new sim card in and no problems since. Updated to Marshmallow with no problem. I love it and my kids love it. Thank You!
"I'm a big Sony fan, and think they make great products, much more so than Samsung, LG or even HTC, and certainly on par with Apple. Sony products are well designed/engineered, solid build quality consistent with the long established reputation. Where as Samsung/LGs may have great specs. on paper and look good on the outside, their inside components are definitely lower quality in call quality, antenna reception or durability/design. Just remember there are no free lunches out there. Samsung LG is more like Honda/Toyota and will never be BMW/Mercedes. I have been using Sony smart mobile phone/tablets pretty much for the last 3 years now, and I'm hooked. From the Sony Xperia Z, to the Z Ultra, to the Z1s, Z3 smartphones, Z, Z2, Z3 tablet compact, to the Z4 tablet and now trying the Z5 premium. I have to say that While it's not Sony's fault in the SD810 processor, all the overheating issues are still true, no matter what Sony had tried, to engineer extra heatsinks to dissipate the extra heat generated by a horribly made Qualcomm SnapDragon 810. Qualcomm SD810 single handedly ruined this otherwise superior phone. From the 4k Screen, touch screen improvements, to the beautifully made premium look and feel, having all the makings of a topline product. In 90 degree+ ambient temperatures, normal use, no multimedia, the phone got hot enough that I can't take a call without a BT device, because putting it up against my face is too uncomfortably hot. Even though the phone doesn't shut down, but you'll feel like you're holding a hot potato in your hands and that's not good. This would have been a wonderful device, and potentially a top seller had it come with the SD820 chipset, what a combination that would be. This also explains why Sony decided to not sell any of the Z5s here in the US, as American tech savvy consumers will not likely put up with overheating issues. So I would say, if you love Sony's get the Z3s, no issues what so ever, or skip the Z5s and go straight to X series, but know you're no longer getting the best latest greatest from Sony with the Xperia Xs. Wish I had better news, but I'm struggling with upgrade choices as well."
"This phone is worthless, I have factory reset it several times since I got it and it's still giving me problems."
Works great!
"Best phone I ever had!!Beautiful, fast and sexy!"
"although the battery does not last long, as they say."
Buen producto
When I plug in my headphones they dont work.
"Absolutely best android phone! Don't listen to the haters here, most likely user error!"
"Nice smartphone, get heat a little like other phones, just the battery life is not longer that the previous version, but it's a good smartphone. 4k recorder consume to much battery and resources. The only fault in the phone."
It is the wrong model but is OK.
"Not very good, is accessible for cost and quality"
"Super sexy, feels great in the hand...however, upon inserting SIM and turning on, a software update loaded, and now my contacts, and ability to dial a number, do not work! WTH?"
"I don't know why it was opened when I get it. The ups package was good. Also, the system language was already set with Chinese."
"I received a DUAL SIM Z5, even though the description doesn't say so. This is not a single sim phone. I wanted the single sim. But received a DUAL SIM Z5 PREMIU,. Though all features remain same. I do not need the dual sim."
"4g sony Z5 premium clocked at down load speed 36.7 mg's beats my techie son's samsung lte edge.sitting side by side, same AT&T; samsung son gets beat by 13 mg's"
All perfect. A great phone !!! It broadly met expectations in terms of product and service delivery. Widely recommended. I apologize for my grammar in English !.
Beautiful but gets hot quickly
"Good phone, the 4k trip is gimmicky just due to the lack of true 4k support in android atm. Cyanogenmod 13 is already in development. Stop by XDA and See the Sony repos on github. The heat issues out of the box are being worked on with custom kernels. The blah blah about whether or not to unlock the bootloader for the sake of keeping Xreality and minimally important Sony DRM functions goes like this, ""Meh, unlock your bootloader."""
"Very nice device, but I got the refurbished one. Also I found hair line scratches on the screen."
It was everything I wanted and more
HI everyone I'm from United States new York city and only work with t mobile but it will work with at&t but phone/Yes texting/yes Internet/no
"Excellent phone, honestly 4k is pointless with no support from services like Netflix or YouTube but pictures still look amazing and chrome back has a nice luxury look."
I bought this because I love Sony. Also my z3 micro USB port quit shortly after the warranty expired. I sent it in to be repaired and Sony could not repair it plus Sony removed the back and did not re-adhere it. I love Sony so I replaced it with this and love it. Don't worry about no warranty because it will fail after it expires anyways.
Jack for headphone has some problems
"lots of space, speedier than predecessor and phenominal performance, no lag downloading, processing or streaming content, great product."
Nice phone
excelent
"Excellent picture and good volume on the speaker. I'm hooked on the Sony products! Camera takes great pictures, even in low light. Love it!"
The phone works and looks awesome!
"Let me start off by saying this phone is breathtaking, from the head turning design to the 3840 x 2160 resolution screen.-A few thoughts-Display: Before this phone I have never seen 4K resolution before with my own eyes so I only could imagine what it'll look like. Coming from my former Sony Xperia™ Z3 Dual I could always record video in 4K but never could see it because what the smartphone displayed was only 1920 x 1080P (1080p) so after receiving this phone and after downloading a few 4K videos and photos I can say I was not disappointed one bit it actually far pass my expectations! Colors pop, blacks are true and the Triluminos / X-Reaility technology brings it all together.Design: just got this Smartphone and already countless compliments, glass front and back the back isn't just ""mirror like"" it is a mirror! Which I find very useful when taking a 23mp selfie but it'll grab up fingerprints like crazy I find my self having to clean it off a few times a day but it's not a problem for me becuase I always clean my phones repeatedly anyways. The chrome framework is amazing and I love they put the two front facing speakers back on the edge of the screen like they used to have it in the Sony Xperia™ Z2 models very simplistic. I didn't not like the two speaker placements on the Z3 models, on the bottom left side you'll find a laser cut (Xperia) logo and 2 thumbs up for keeping the lanyard/charm part in the design!Features: Sony Xperia™ Z5 Premium is the Smartphone I decided to get over all the other premium Smartphones is because it offers so much more for my needs that the others simply just doesn't. Being able to turn on my PlayStation 4 from anywhere and play my games with a Dualshock 4 controller and play all my console games on the go is great. Holding the power button to show the (Record Screen) Option and livestream my gameplay right off my phone with no added application is good all on the WORLDS FIRST 5.5in 4K display. I've tested a lot of highly graphical games on here and it is a huge improvement over my old Z3 Dual, games run great! Have never overheated once. I gamed for over 8hrs and the battery life is so good, but watching videos a lot can drop the battery life pretty quick I'm guessing becuase it will upscale 1080P resolution to 1260P.Overall the shipping was fast the packaging was great in the box I got a pair of standard Sony earbuds, USB/Micro USB cable, wall adapter (not quick charge 2.0 which the phone do support), booklets. I have no complaints."
I love this phone its super fast and the chrome is so nice just get it. Side note for those like me that have T-MOBILE IT DOES HAVE FULL 4G LTE do not put the APN settings by your self there is an option to DOWNLOAD INTERNET SETTINGS if you do this you will get LTE if you put them in your self you will just get HSPA+. Hope this helps.
"Crashed in less than a month. No warranty means I'm out $700, and assurion only wants to give me a S4 as a replacement. Buy something from your carrier and don't try and be fancy."
"Purchased March 10 and died April 14!!!!!!!!!!! This is the first time I've ever bought a phone (without a carrier subsidy from a contract obligation), and this phone won't power on after powering it off (with 20% battery left). None of the recommendations I've found online to power on this phone will work! So much money WASTED!!!!!!!!!"
This is something worth getting !!!
The phone worked great for under a year and then the antenna broke and I couldn't get a signal from the cellular network anymore.
Excelente
Excellent product!!!!
"xperia line has never disappointed me and the z5 after a few month is my favorite up to date, I'm thinking of getting the xz soon."
"I bought my Z5 Premium From The Wireless Circle and it's a Singapore version if you want to know. It works well. No sign of being a dud like China's. Fingerprint scanner is good and fast. No sign of overheating or getting hotter than normal. Works with ultra mobile which are my services. Overall I definitely like it better than the Z5. I'm sure it'll work well playing remote play with the Ps4 and ps1, gba and all the other emulators just like the Z5. Camera quality really is good and so is 4k recording. Very stable and steady and I love it. Took the risk of ordering international since I don't trust China. But Singapore is doing me well :) no regrets."
Good
My favorite phone so far. Sony rules Samsung sux.
"Within a month the phone started acting up, phone jacks kept reading as if it was plugging in and out every half a second. Phone's unusable now, money down the drain for me. Steer clear and get another Xperia model."
"I love this Phone. Even today I like it I am tempted to get a new Sony Phone but they aren't making them with the 4k Screen so I have declined to upgrade as of yet. The Camera is great. Remember Sony uses a full size pocket camera sensors in their phones they work great. Plus it is Water/Dirt/Dust Proof. I have taken it in the pool and at the beach, no problems. Just washed it off wit tap water after going into salt water."
3 month's and phone is dead unbelievable...
Best phone I ever had fast clean and beautiful display 4k video is amazing no over heating issues. water proof and almost all apps can be uninstalled.. lite and battery last 2 days before charge under normal use.
Is not useful
"probably one of the best cellphone ever used, even it's over a year old, still performs on par with new phones that came out now, holds a very good battery life, although these days with Pokemon Go no phone can hold it's battery, but before that, can go 2 days without charging on a regular use, definitely last through a whole day.screen is big enough, phone feels very classy, water proof definitely a plus. even as Sony release the X Performance, i would still use this, other than the camera, there are no real performance upgrade from the Z5P to the XP."
"This is a great phone - I quite enjoy the Sony line exclusively. The sound volume is less than par but different features more than make up what thia phone lacks. Definitely enjoy the fast processor, screen display as well as functionality. Beautifully made and perfectly engineered."
"This is not a good phone as far as running application and taking photos, and the battery life is excellent. But damn this thing is brittle, I don't put cases on my phones which was a huge mistake with this phone.I have had this phone for 3 months and already with normal wear and tear there are multiple visible scratches on the back and one on the glass on front of the phone. I have no idea how it got any of these scratches and non of my previous phones ever got a scratch on the glass. So now I don't know if it is waterproof as I don't know how deep the scratches go, and waterproof was a main quality when picking this phone.Also the Bluetooth is very sporadic when hooking to my car sometimes it works flawlessly other times I have to turn off the Bluetooth and turn it back on and resync with my car. Sometimes i have to do this multiple times. my previous phone didn't have this problem, the worse part about this is that it will play the audio through the phone which is muted so my audio books are playing in the background without me realizing it.There is also a Phantom touch that occurs on the top left randomly. so the menu on top will drop and raise and drop and raise. This is usually fixed by rubbing the top left of the phone but still annoying.The fingerprint scanner works about 40% of the time for no apparent reason.And the double tap to view screen is severely broken. This is the feature where double tapping the screen performs the same action as the power button. I had to disable this feature as it being in my pocket would randomly turn on the screen and just mash the dial buttons.On the plus side, it runs applications fairly well when I don't get the phantom touching going on and it hasn't butt dialed the cops yet. This is my first Sony phone and I probably will not be getting another one. Again this is all the things I have experienced in just 3 short months."
"This phone overheat so much that you can not hold it in your hand,"
Absolutely AWESOME
"This was supposed to be the best phone ever. So far very disappointed and looking at some of my friends' phones I should've gone for Samsung. Camera sucks, the pictures are low quality compared to iPhone and Samsung. When recording video after less than a minute the cellphone heats up too much and just aborts recording due to heat, as ridiculous as it sounds. I carry with me a second cellphone (a cheap Samsung), both on t-mobile and the other phone has far much better signal all the time. This phone even struggles at times to find signal. I take really good care of this phone and now the headphones plug stopped working. Screen seems to have a false contact now and blinks all the time, making it extremely uncomfortable and annoying.Such a shame and disappointment. I might finally switch to iPhone or back to Galaxy. Good bye Sony."
"Robert here...I got my Z5 Premium this past Sunday and thus far, I absolutely LOVE this phone. After doing much research, I picked the single sim International version as it has capacity for faster download. I'm really impressed with the sound quality of this piece. I'd been using an old Droid3 as my Mp3 player and using a cheap ZTE Maven as my communicator with Cricket service. I had to take it to a Cricket store to get the mini sim cut to nano size (free). Being an E6853 vs the E6883, the product registration site wouldn't allow me to register so I had to call. It turns out mine was originally set for the Panamanian market. The young lady I spoke with, Alice, was very helpful with getting me set up for my 1 yr warranty.I chose the gold color and it is so beautiful. It's such a shame I have to cover it up with a TUDIA Slim-Fit MERGE case. The case actually is very nice though. I am really afraid of damaging this thing.I chose the Z5 Premium mostly for it's music handling prowess. This thing must have some Walkman genes in it. I think I found a replacement for my Zune with the cracked screen. I've read some iffy reviews regarding the fingerprint scanner but' I've not had any problem with it at all. It does not work when you first power up the phone and that's by design. The volume button location is a bit kooky but, I can get used to that. It seems a bit slow to sync with MediaPlayer. I'm gonna try and use a faster port. I've also heard of people complaining about a lack of image stability. Mine has it and it works very well. One cool thing I found with this being an unlocked phone is I'm able to use tethering on USB/Bluetooth and WiFi HotSpot with no restrictions.This is going to be a rolling review as I gain more experience with it so, I will update later.Update: 08/09/2016I've had my phone shut down/reboot on me twice. Both times it had been in my front jeans pocket. I bet it overheated and went into protection. Thinking back now, I wonder if this is why I've had so much trouble with my android phones. I've had them reboot on me before and this Xperia Z5 Premium is the first one that's performed the same after. I think I like that. I'm still going to work on that pocket thing though. Everything else is perfect so far."
"I upgraded from iPhone 5s and I love it. My carrier is att so no problem using it. well it took me a while to figure out how to use internet. It kept saying offline without wifi environment.( I knew my sim was just fine because I used it for iphone 5s till I received this xperia) If you have the same issue like me ( for me it is the first android phone ever so I knew nothing about it) go to Setting, then tap ""More"" you will see ""Internet settings"" at the end saying ""download settings for internet and MMS"" After downloaded, then finally I see little be more reception bars (for some reasons) and started seeing LTE right next to the bar. And I could use internet without wifi. Hope this info will help someone like me know nothing about android phone."
"This phone has better sound quality than the Galaxy S7 Edge for sure, my brother has a Samsung and he admitted it.This Phone > IPhone."
"Just one month and shutdown and never work again, i call sony and tell me the cellphone dont have warranty y try to repair with a third party."
Very nice.
Died after 9 months and my a to zero claim is being denied by amazon do not buy Xperia phones
"I absolutely love this phone. I don't understand the negativity that some reviews mention. It is a sleek looking gorgeous phone especially the chrome version I got. The most amazing thing is the display, you'll clearly see a difference with its 4K display. It takes great pictures, crisp and detailed. I'm not a heavy user and the battery lasts me at least 2 days easily. Music on this phone is Sony's high standard. Coming to the software it is near stock Android and runs smoothly. I was worried about getting this phone reading some reviews but I'm glad I went ahead with it. There is heating issue but only when you use the camera for a longer period but it cools down quick too. Works perfectly in sync with the Sony SmartWatch 3. I use a clear case to show off the chrome awesomeness. This is a great smartphone and hopefully Sony comes up with the successor in the next week's IFA."
Received quickly and well packaged. I took my T-Mobile (USA) SIM card out of my Xperia Z3 and installed it into this phone without problems. The phone has a very nice display and works great.
"This is a bad product, It is a product that has no guarantee by sony."
"INCREDIBLY F' SWEET! After months of research and looking, I found this device that meets my specs and is aesthetically pleasing to the eye! Built strongly with metal bezel and chrome back, I invested in the Rhidon covers for the front and back and keep it in a leather holster when its on my belt. I am staying away from rubber or silicone covers due to signal strength being insulated from them.Sony- Erriccson knocks it out of the park with this one! Best display I ever seen on a phone.It's probably the coolest phone I ever picked up! I can tout the highest price I ever paid for a phone in my life by far, but it is worth it because it interests me.If you are tech savvy and like the challenge of customizing devices with their factory restrictions in mind, then first do your research on these models and then some, before jumping into it with utter confidence if it interests you.Thank you Sony. Thank you AT&T for awesome monthly service. Thank you NGP for a lower price than elsewhere and fast shipping less than a week. Great job listing item and speedy transaction!"
Excelent product works great in all tasks and the Best eficient batery saverThe best
Made a great gift for her. It has the best camera in market with a beautiful display.
"I waited a loooooong time for this phone. It was finally released. Great specs and all, and worked perfectly for the first 5 months. All of a sudden, it started shutting down at least twice a week. And finally I tried to make a call and it's completely dead. I have tried all means and resources available online to restart this phone, but TO NO AVAIL! Sucks!!! $900 down the drain. I'll just return to my ever faithful HTC brand and never go back to sony"

"The battery life retention is zero; you have to charge the phone all the time, even when you are not using it. It is a waste of my hard earned money."
"The phone""was promised ""water resistant""somehow just by rising it, the screen was blacked out. yeah..... just some fancy rhetoric."
"Faulty product. Gets overheated when I got ut and now it starts to restart the system automatically. The battery only stands for 3 hours. My friend got one from another place and his works perfectly. So I think it's this seller selling the faulty products. The phone is mailed from hk, not JP."
"I've been excited waiting to buy this phone and i finally did. It has exceeded my expectations! Its incredibly fast, the fingerprint scanner works seamlessly, and with the bundled quick charger filling up the already long lasting battery is a breeze! Low light pictures could be better but I'm not at all disappointed. My only complaint is that playing more demanding games tends to cause the phone to get a little toasty for my likings."
"I know its sold without warranty(international sale) but i thought it would last longer, not three months. Bought it for my son as a Christmas present but is already in a drawer with a burned screen. :-("
I loved this device. Only problem right now is that it won't charge OR turn on anymore.
Awesome phone does everything and the camera and screen are great and everything works perfect
"Probably the best phone in the US that no one has heard of unless you're a phone geek. I've had to work with phones for 10 years in the cellular industry and have seen many phones come and go. I have loved the recent Xperia series from Sony and always believe that they deliver the best products. In terms of phones, it's no secret that Sony has had a rocky history to say the least (Sony Ericsson partnership and a myriad of failures).I'll try and keep this short, but at least provide some more of a detailed review. Feel free to check the other versions of Z5 Premium (Chrome and Black) for others, but I notice the Gold version is sorely lacking any thorough review so here go:I've been using this phone for about month and don't typically review anything until I have had a chance to use it for more than a few days. First impressions can be misleading, so I let myself download apps, use throughout the day, take pictures, videos, etc and get a feel for the phone. I will say I have used a few other Xperias before. I am jumping from a Xperia Z1 I purchased in Japan about 2 years ago and loved that phone as well. Probably some Sony fanboy-ish going on here, but I will try and be as neutral as possible.Performance of the phone is fantastic. Everything moves very quick and smooth. Responds very well overall. One of my favorite features (yes it's nothing new, but performs so so well) is the fingerprint scanner. Like I said, I have worked in the cellular industry and I know the iPhone first brought this to the mainstream but I've really found myself using the fingerprint scanner a lot and the fact that the phone is larger, the scanner is actually a much easier way to unlock the screen than sliding up the unlock motion. And again, it just works so smooth!Perhaps my favorite part of this phone, and a big purchasing decision, is the camera. I have two little ones and whenever the family is out, I am typically default camera man, so there was a lot of debate with the wife as to whether I should invest in a good DSLR camera or buy the loaded Z5P phone. I haven't regretted my decision as the Z5P takes beautiful pictures, 23MP, though I find myself using the 20MP 16:9 format and even the Premium Auto mode is great for taking quick shots (using the quick wake up mode). Yes, it does take 4K video, which looks unbelievable. And Sony does have a little snapshot tool to take 8MP screenshots of 4K video stills if you so desire. The 4K SCREEN ON THE PHONE looks phenomenal. I've read a lot of tech sites instantly saying that the 4K screen is unnecessary and a gimmick, however to be honest, I'm not sure what screen they're looking at. I've put up the Z5P screen next to my Z1 (1080p) and for me personally I can definitely tell a difference. The Z5P is so much clearer and the colors are very vibrant (though not overly saturated). Also, the camera has a 1080p/60fps video mode which also works great. Lastly, the camera has an insanely fast autofocus, which does actually autofocus, which helps with quickshots. Again, camera alone was worth the purchase.Battery: Always a touchy issue with so many and always the quickest to get people to stop buying your product. With heavy usage, and again, from experience, I know what constitutes heavy, you can still EASILY get a days worth of usage on your phone. I have tried several times to intentionally kill my battery doing things that typically kill other phones instantly--biggies being streaming video, games, GPS, camera and the often under-appreciated phone calls/video(data) calls. I don't think people really know how much phone calls kill your battery, but again, tried to get it to under a day and it didn't really work. I would still have about 20% at the end (say 9-10pm) of the day. Now again, I don't have the luxury of literally sitting down from 8am-8pm doing nothing but that, but throughout the day, I would watch/play/listen/etc and still had enough battery to do more by the time I put the kids to bed. Also, the last few days I've been trying something else and seeing how the battery preserves itself. During work, I don't heavily use my phone (because, you know, I'm WORKING), but even at that with 2 email accounts synced up, and other various services running (mind you, no facebook, twitter or other SNS-sorry no social life :) I still do some messaging but still have about 80% at the end of day. I DO NOT charge the phone overnight, lose a couple more percentages and start day 2 with about 75-78%. I then continue to work again and continue to drain battery and again still have a moderate (about 65%) battery. Now again, by no means am I saying this is an end-all guide to the 5-day battery phone, but again, for practical usage for people who don't live on their phones 24/7 I can easily get 3 working days of usage on my phone, maybe 4 if I push it. Again many factors go into this, screen brightness, accounts, etc. but I have been thrilled with my battery life.Ok, I'm rambling too much so I'll wrap it up. Quickly wanted to address a negative:Bezel--never understood why people think this phone has larger bezels than others. I think there was someone who actually measured the % of screen that the bezels take up and Xperias actually have a better % than iPhones and some others. Now one thing I will note is the 3 touch buttons (back, home and apps) are taking up part of the 5.5"" screen. While others, like Samsung have the buttons underneath so you get a true full screen. Anyway, minor design gripe, but still more than enough real estate on the screen.Little extra here too, again, read about how some people thought it was such a novelty that the phone was water/dust proof rated yet kept the charging port open. If you have experience with Japanese phones, you probably know that waterproofing phones is very old news. Almost all Japanese phone manufacturers, Sony, Sharp, Kyocera, make all their phones waterproof because many Japanese take their phones in the bath with them. In fact, my wife has a basic Sharp Aquos from about 2-2 1/2 years ago that is also waterproof, but already had the open charging port design implemented. Again, just a little tidbit there about the novelty of waterproofing phones, so yes the charging port is open, but the phone is still sealed. I also can attest to this as I have used the phone for pictures in not only heavy rainfall but also at a waterpark (my little girl drenched my phone but totally fine).Alright, I'm done now. Hopefully this helped out and if you purchase it, ENJOY!"
"My brother loves his phone,he is a sony xperia person so i expected he would love it"
"When it came to my door you best believe I opened it faster than the rubiks cube wr. Great phone, quickcharge, earbuds, can play your ps4 on it without losing progress from the tv and loads more. If you have the money and are looking for a unique experience then get this. Also chrome is always the way to go. A definite brgging right to be able to say "" My phones chrome and is waterproof."" I've talked long enough. 10/10"
Good
"I bought one and when I turn it on it works okay but the apps were inChineese. Also it would not pick up on a 4G LTE.. I went for it because it specified it was an international version but it did not meet its specification, so I had to return it. Sony has to improve on the 4G LTE. It does not work. I'll go for a galaxy Note"
Excellent
"Sony Xperia phones are great. Never bought an Apple, never thought following the crowd was the best way to go. Dollar to Dollar, Sony beats Apple. Waterproof, scratch resistant, and fingerprints don't really show unless you really got greasy ones, fantastic display, great sound quality. I just found it a bit big to hold in my palm, and the volume toggle is not well placed as many have complained about....so why doesn't Sony change it? 4K pics are great and so is the camera, but don't think it's as good as a ""regular"" camera with a bigger lens. Plus, buildings and tress may ""bend"" a bit depending on your picture angle which is kinda like a cheaper point and shoot. But, then again, it's a very small lens and so you will get some grainy pictures as well regardless of the megapixels."
great product!
BE AWARE... No LTE FOR AT&T for this phone which is not good and problems with screen...there is sometimes when I try to press the left top corner or the right top corner and it's not responding..... When I shut it off and turn it back on then it works..... I think these are refurbished phones and I made a big mistake by buying a phone from Internet..... WITH NO WARRANTY....
"A great phone that delivers as promised. Excellent photo quality, very fast focussing, and adequate low light photo ability are some of the great features. The battery life is astounding. It feels as a true high quality, luxury product that you can proudly carry and have people ask you inquisitively what phone you are using as it's doubtful that they have ever seen any Sony XPeria series phone. A+"
awesome phone
Amazing. Best phone i ever owned. From samsung to htc. This one kills them all. Minor issue with tmobile setting up the phone other then that it is amazing..Great battery life. quick to charge. stunning display. This is the best phone! Ashamed that Sony does not push the market and let's apple and samsung. They simply do not compare.Only issue is that i cannot use remote play without wifi :( my carrier network is strong enough. Maybe a setting I'm missing.
"Broken after not even a month of use. Power button//finger print scanner defective. The phone just died on me, and I had to pay for it to be repaired, since there is no warranty. You are better off getting a Samsung of an Iphone for the cost. Please, please, please, don't purchase unless you wanna pay for expensive repairs."
too heavy
"only shop the U.S. if you are in the U.S. Return hassle, the camera doesn't work and the phone keeps freezing."
This thing was an amazing phone 'til it just died for no reason. No warranty on US and you couldn't use the 4k other than playing back your own recorded videos. So pass on this and get a US warranty Z5 or XZ even though they don't have finger print scanner. I keep mine unlocked with my heartrate monitor
"I've had this phone for almost a year. I use it on the T-Mobile network and the LTE works great. The camera is great! The screen is only 4k if you are looking at pictures in the Albums app and the default sony video player. The battery life is great as long as you don't keep needless features on while not using them. The waterproofing is great, I've washed the phone in the shower several times and it has not failed. I think it is funny that other brands are just now water proofing their phones, Sony is way ahead of the curve in that aspect. The power button integrated finger print scanner is a nice touch,so you don't always have to enter an unlock code. Overall the phone is great and I waited almost a year just to write a review because I really wanted to thoroughly use and test the phone."
"The phone is for two SIM cards and buy (and I came out more expensive) model is a single SIM card since this model has better performance. I request that I return the difference in the money they charged me for more between the two models, because I feel cheated. Thank you."
"This should be a great phone, with a bright sharp screen and the ip86 rating but it is almost unusable due to the constant reboots it goes through. After searching online, it seems that this is a common issue for the z5. No issues with the seller, for what it's worth."
Very good
Chinese
Love it! :3
Awesome device. Best clarity I've ever seen on a phone.
Not bad
very good phone. the only issue is the battery that don't last long. only a day.
"This is my first ever Android Phone, having used BlackBerry since 2009. So most of my ""problems"" are just learning a new User Interface / Operating System (I'd have that problem regardless of what Android or Apple phone I switched to).One feature I didn't think I'd use is the fingerprint scanner. This scanner is accurate and trouble free. I love it. Compared to my wife's Note 5, it feels like a next generation technology (I don't tell her that). The USA Version of the regular Z5 has deleted this option. Big mistake, I'd get the international version of the Z5 regardless if I was getting the Premium or not. It's a very cool scanner, very impressed with the technology.I saw a few reviews saying that LTE doesn't work - it does. It doesn't display ""4GTLE"" it only displays ""4G"" but rest assured you're on LTE. I took a screenshot of a speed test using T-Mobile, USA but AT&T is also a GSM carrier and this phone has the bands for it as well.OK, I love the screen. I know that OLED is all the rage these days but I love this LCD screen because it can dim low in a dark room and can get very bright. The auto sensor works great on this phone too. The screen is beautiful.The camera is great! Coming from BlackBerry which always used subpar crappy cameras, I admit anything would have been an improvement but it takes great photos in line with my wife's Note 5 (probably better but we won't tell her).The front stereo speakers are fine. They are not as loud as one or two out there but are louder and clearer than many if not most.I love that it's water resistant.It looks beautiful. I got the Chrome but since I'm afraid to carry it naked and put a minimal transparent case on it, I'm wondering if I shouldn't have gone with the Gold. Any color choice is beautiful.As far as the 4K - The stock 4K video by Sony does look great but so does anything I'm viewing on here. I'd base my choice between Z5 or Z5 Premium based on what you prefer in phone size and screen size rather than 4K or not.I used to love BlackBerry because I liked carrying something different (they are very rare these days in the US) and I like this phone for the same reason. Everyone has either an Apple or a Samsung - but this Sony is something different. I really like it and recommend it.I intend on updating this review at the start of 2017 to give an update on how it works long term. But the initial quality is outstanding."
"Phone is horrible. Sticks for over 10 mins, randomly. Screen turns black and you cant see incoming calls. I have no added features, apps, or covers on phone. Constantly having to reset phone. All this happens within 37 days of ownership. Seller..Mobile front...wont even respond or reply. Run from this product and seller."
This phone is greatBattery last daysScreen is hugeResolution is amazingOnly problem I came upon was the fact that whenever I made a call or received one my screen would go black. Now the call would be fine but thier was no way of me ending the call or multi task on my phone while I made the call.Everything els works great though!
"Wooow, what a cell phone. I was clearly hesitating. But I think I made a right one.Nothing to say about it"
"Awesome phone, super fast shipping, great price"
Great smartphone in 2015. Evething is perfect.Stephen Yang
"I ordered this and it came really fast everything. Opened it and it had all hardware. It's had USB hub charger, USB cable,and it also came with some Sony headphones.this phone is great."
"Came a day earlier than expected! The phone is brand new, booted up and is working on AT&T (and probably any other GSM network). I was pleasantly surprised that mine came with headphones and the quick charger! Hopefully, everything continues to work fine and I won't have to deal with any peculiar defects."
"just got this phone, nice phone but can't say i'm totally happy right now. First, everything connected with T-mobile in new york, 4g lte, music is great with stereo and apt-x bluetooth,Hi-Res audio, 4k screen good. Now the bad, can't get this phone to work as a speaker phone so i don't have to keep it on my ear all the time also sound quality is not that great for phone calls. the battery barely last a day,so don't understand how they make claim of two days. So I'll give it a few day and make a decision on if i should return it because it cost to much to be having any problems. P.S (give u my verdict in a few days...)11/30- Lots of good features but the battery might be a deal breaker?... The battery really sucks for a premium phone and does not live up to it's claim...i mean if you turn everything off and don't use anything or the features it has, it last two days??? reminds me of HTC EVO i had years ago i had to buy an extended battery.....and the quick charger is not so quick. Might go back to note 4, last all day with no problems...like phone but pissed off with battery..12/1-I use this phone the same way i use my note 4, and have no problem with battery. but this phone barely last the whole day ..sending it back and will wait for z6, i brought this phone to use, not play how do you make battery last through the day"
Exactly as described loved the phone and arrived earlier than expected
"Awesome phone, lots of people have commented it while I use it. Love it. The back I use as a mirror."
Product arrived on time and it was just as expected
Amazing.... Awesome
"This phone is awesome! Nice big vivid screen, stylish gorgeous looks that make you want to double take. Gives you a really good quality premium feel for a phone. Sound clarity is decent with two front facing speakers. Words of advice protect this phone from front to back because it easily slips right through your fingers making it very easy to drop, but other than that I love this phone and highly recommend it if you have the extra money to throw at it!"
nice phone
I love my new xperia z5 premium!
"I had a Samsung note 4, this Xperia Z5 Premium is way better. More powerful, nice pictures with the 23mp camera."
Wonderfull Phone i love it is reallu nice
I've had two z3 phones and now the z5 and they are not a durable phone every phone I've owned from Sony has shattered the features and picture quality is awesome . Its fast just not a durable phone if you are rough on phones
"Ordered my z5 premium chrome through universal goods, the phone got here fast I ordered it on a Friday and it got here the following Friday. Everything was new in its package and well protected with bubble wrap in the box. I have had the phone for about 2 weeks and so far I am extremely happy with it. My last 2 phones have been iPhones and this phone is far better in every aspect. I've seen reviews of people complaining about the finger print scanner but I have not had any problems yet its extremely responsive to the touch. Also since I had read those reviews I simply used two Id fingerprint scanners for the same finger so that might have helped. Overall it's an amazing phone, great image display, sound, function and quality. I never realized until now how greatly underrated Sony phones have been."
Great solid phone!
"This phone is amazing, Sony really created a good product. I believe it's the best android phone you can get now, specially 4K camera and display. The only unfortunately thing is the battery capacity."
"It Is a great phone, it met all my expectations. I was a little confused with the card, it uses a nano sim card, but I went to my carrier and they cutted it and helped me set up the Internet connection LTE. I have been using it for almost a week, so far, so good. The fingerprint sensor works well. Camera Is amazing, took some pictures and videos and I just love them."
It's just great.!
"It glides on almost every surface...One day i was laying down on concrete floor and my phone slid off my pocket and fell about 3-4 inches before it hit the ground and cracked the screen. BE WARNED, it will slide off of metal, wood and plastic and will brake easily."
Everything was perfect! Thanks
"It's a really nice phone with a great display. Stuck an AT&T sim in and it works perfectly fine here in California. Only draw back is that it didn't come in English, and that the mobile data was not working, but with a quick search on the internet took a few minutes to fix."
Thank you for selling me the best smartphone in the world. The problem is you refused to sell its accessories. Anyway thanks!
Excellent mobile.
bes phone ever
"All what is mentioned was true. Nice cellphone, nice seller"
"So far everything is working fine.Urgent info - The phone I received was configured in Chinese (Mandarin) so it needed to be reset in English which was a relatively easy task if you are familiar with the android OS.Next, in order to use any mobile data for at&t or T-mobile you must set your access point for each respective company. This is as simple as searching the APN names for either and setting it accordingly or calling technical support to get the APN designation.Notes - The phone is very slippery, I've never contemplated buying phone cases for previous phones but considering how nice this phone is I would hate to drop it. I am coming from a Sony Xperia Z(first gen) which was ergonomically superior.The camera is far superior than any other phone I've used with great clarity and fast enough to snap off some quick shots.As others have stated the sound key is not in a good position but it may be an issue of internal space. It works fine in the horizontal position which it seems more suited to. The screen is excellent with no flaws spotted yet.As with heat, I haven't noticed anything alarming. I've shot two 5 minute videos and it does get warm but nothing worse than what I've used before. It surprisingly gets hotter while on a call.Update- After a few weeks of use and the latest OS update, the heat has grown a bit but nothing concerning, The heat dissipates rather quickly when yo run you hand over it.Going back to the slipperiness. Man, its like trying to hold a ice cube sometimes. It really needs a case or rubberized bumper. I tried cleaning it with alcohol, but nothing helped.Do not update this phone to latest update. The first received OS system worked fine, there has been a few niggles with the latest software patch. Sometimes the screen will fail to rotate on apps, and will only start working again if you restart phone, or launch the camera and open a picture(only thing I've tested so far to get it to work). This has happened twice in the passed week and i don't know what is causing it, but it never happened before the update.Comparison against the new Samsung s7 edge. The edge feels significantly thinner and lighter and has more grip. This phone feels like a lead weight in comparison. This screen is a bit more vibrant in low light situations, but in daylight the edge is far superior. I personally like the bigger profile of this phone, but not when laying down trying to hold it in a elevated position. Simply too heavy without using two hands. I figured the problem with the flat blueish tinge is not an issue with the phone, but the actual OS, as it also appears to look similar on the Edge. The actual application boxes and menus are poorly colored on this OS. When viewing anything else, the color looks absolutely fine on both screens, with the Xperia having a slight edge in clarity and sharpness. The S7edge has a very smooth overlay and looks less pixelated in some cases. It's not until viewing documents and pictures/videos does the ppi of the sony stand out. The speakers on the xperia is superior in depth and direction but not as loud. The s7 edge does a better job suppressing bass which gives it a bit more clarity and loudness.The camera layout is better on the Xperia, but the edge beats it with smoothness and color reproduction. The default settings on the xperia is very bland, and takes some time setting it accordingly to get better money shots. The edge gives you a much more artistic profile strait out the box. The edge camera is also a bit faster, making it more stable. Video playback is better on the xperia given the flat edges and larger screen. I don't particular like the edge for watching videos given the curved sides. Lastly, contrary to my issues with the xperia being very slippery and heavy, i actually have a harder time grasping the edge do to the thin side profile, when scrolling through menus on the s7, it feels much more wobbly and loose in my hand.If weight is an issue i would go with the edge. This Xperia is a bigger fashion statement and the screen is slightly better. But i would say the mirror on the back of this phone yields more usefulness :). I've had three girls ask to use my phone and check out their faces with the mirror on the back."
"I absolutely LOVE THIS PHONE! I just did a ""forced upgrade"" from my previous phone, Sony Xperia Z1s to this, Sony Xperia Z5 Premium. The reason I say ""forced upgrade"" is due to the fact that my screen broke after about 2+ Years of service, I wouldn't have upgraded if it wasn't for that. Anyway I been having this phone on my radar since it was released, so I bought it. Seller shipped it quick, and it arrived ahead of time! :D The phone itself is awesome and the 4K is beautiful! The PS4 Remote Play feature is a HUGE PLUS! Works great, a little laggy at times but playable. The Chrome background is nice and camera is flawless. Phone is FAST! I received a Chinese Version of this phone, and I am using T-Mobile USA. The 4G LTE works but does not display, but with a Internet Speed Test you will see it is there. All in all, solid phone, and great purchase! 5 STARS!"
It is great!!
"The product was in a factory sealed box. A lot of non-English information included with the phone, but after the phone booted I was able to select English and it was smooth sailing after that. The box contained ear phones and a UCH-10 wall charger with US spec wall prongs with a USB cable. The phone connected to AT&T without incident but in order to get connected to mobile data, I had to download the specs. This is done though the phone settings.Very pleased with my purchase."
I used 8month already broken no warranty
T-mobile:Phone was delivered within the week.(standard delivery)All features work as expectedGreat looking phone with premium feelWould recommend to anyone.If you have used or owned a previous Xperia series phone this phone is a big step up
"i have been a long term xperia fan ever since i first purchases the z1 (honami) a few years ago. Now that i ahev the z5 premium i must say that i am extremely happy with this phone. the clarity of photos and video are quite amazing for a phone. and the waterproofing makes for some added fun as well when i take this phone surfing and wait for a nice wave i just watch videos or listen to music. and the battery life is extrememly good as long as you have the right settings and with stamina mode you can easily double the time you use it.now there are some things to mention since this is an international phone it is not capable of 4G, but it capable of LTE which is good because LTE is actually faster. if you want a 4G phone (slower data speed) then this is not the phone for you. Be sure to set up your mobile network and to download internet and mms setting in the settings because only idiots forget to do that and you're not an idiot... or are you?"
i love my new phone sony xperia z5 premium is really outstanding
"The Sony Xperia Z5 premium phone is one that will certainly get people's attention.It is stylish, it is a beast of a phone, and above all, it is everything you would expect from a premium Sony phone.I love a lot of things on my Z5 premium. Some are great upgrades from my previous phone, the Z1.This is just personal preferences, but I liked the Walkman App before it turned to the Android Lollipop Music App.Lollipop is just not type. I will probably revert to KitKat because I love the UI and overall feel better than Lollipop's.The power button is slightly sunken. Unlike the Z1, where it was easily accessible with a slightly outward button.Lastly, and yes, this is was shocking for me as well. The screen.With a whopping 806 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) 4K screen, you would expect the display quality to be as clear as looking out a window. So unless I bought a faulty phone, I kid you not, the screen looks pixelated. Yes, you read that right. Pixelated.Now, I know that everything except the Album and Video apps are down-scaled to 1080P. So I tested the 4K photos and videos, and to my astonishment, there they are! Still looking pixelated, even at 4K. I had to look through a magnifying glass to see them up close. I compared my old Z1, my dad's Z Ultra and the Z5 Premium. Again big surprise, both my old Z1 and the Z ultra pixels can barely be seen, with very faint black lines separating the pixels, while on the Z5 Premium the lines were considerably much more noticeable.Looking at all three phones from a normal distance, the Z1 and Z Ultra's screens do not look pixelated at all, while my Z5, even from a fair distance, you can still faintly see the pixelation.Basically, I have phone with a 4K display, but it almost makes me feel like it has a WVGA display.Lastly, I've never seen a phone reflect dots from a turned off display before. My Z5 Premium for some reason reflects dots, pixels, I don't know what they are in a squared grid pattern whenever the screen reflects light. Whether its from the Sun or any regular light, you will clearly see them. Regardless if whether the phone is on or not.Conclusion.The phone itself is awesome. Great new features, great audio, superb built quality and respectable camera.It might just be my phone, its too early to tell, since a lot people don't own this phone yet, but make sure to check with others who own the phone and ask if they see pixelation or have a faulty displays in their Z5 Premium as well.[[ASIN:B0171GYNGW Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (CHROME) - International Stock No Warranty]"
"The best phone ever! Beauty, fast anf anothers goods..."
"So far this is the best phone I have ever owned. I'm coming from a Galaxy Note 3 due to the Note 5 not having expandable storage and disappointing me in almost every aspect.First off, after using this phone I immediately fell in love with the waterproof feature. I will never buy another phone that doesn't have resistance to water, I mean honestly the technology is there, if the big companies cant get on the train and get this feature I will simply stay away. I also was able to easily expand my storage by 128gb with a micro SD. The 4K display is something I could live without but it is a nice feature and I can't complain. Battery life is very good for this device I am able to fall asleep with 40% battery from a day of moderate use, wake up and use the phone till mid afternoon with no problems. Charging is pretty fast also. I can leave the phone and forget about it for about an hour and come back to a ton of battery life.I removed a star for the fingerprint scanner getting a slight scratch within the first month of use and rendering it un-usable. Would be nice to use it but not a whole lot I can do about it. I think the next phone I will get will have to have usb type c with super high speed data transfer. We shall see what the future holds."
Amazing smartphone. Out of this world screen and terrific camera. It looks like no other and everybody will ask about it.
"Pros: Unique, Worth the money, Excellent, Powerful device!Cons: No Warrenty for International Stock :/"
Very good my sister love it
"Would gave it a 4, but I ordered chrome and got black."
"Great phone. Beautiful build, top of the line hardware and screen but Do Not bring this anywhere near water."
excelent !!!
"Came brand new, came in Chinese automatically, but easily changed to English, just wish it had delivery options, but the product is excellent!"
Amazing piece of hardware couldn't be happier
"I've been using this phone for a couple of days now, and after watching, reading, and hearing all these reviews as well as feedback from others, I had an idea of what to expect going into purchasing this device.I saw a few have issues with the phone bending, similar to the iPhone 6 Plus when that first released. I've been babying it and taking care of the phone as much as possible, and in that time I've fallen in love. My personal experience is the UI is nice and clean, similar to stock Android with a few added extras, and it's very responsive. I know it's not 4K all the time, and until the Marshmallow update releases, there won't be much support as of yet, however the up scaling of videos in the YouTube app still look simply amazing. The camera isn't really want most hyped it up to be, but I find that it works well and edges out my Note 4 and my father's iPhone 6S Plus, which is perfect enough for me.From the general feel of the build quality, I'd have to mark Sony down as the ""Apple"" of Androids, since I haven't personally felt that the other Android devices did it for me. I tried the Note 5, S6 Edge Plus, iPhone 6S Plus, Nexus 6P, and multiple others, but the Xperia takes the cake in feeling the most premium to me. Calls sound crystal clear, and the front facing speakers, while not as powerful as some HTC or Motorola phones, still sound much better than my previous iPhone.All in all, love the device, hope Sony continues to push out updates for it in the future, and I may stick with them should they continue producing this type of quality into their devices."
"Awesome phone, but after a few months of use, definitely a bit too big for me. Might go down to the regular version instead. 4k screen shows zero difference vs other screens."
"Cool Gadget. A beauty to behold...Expensive? Yes but its still worth the hype. Finger Print scanner on the Power key is fast and responsive every timeBattery Life is not exactly 48hrs but i keep everything on so i cant really benchmark.to achieve two days battery life, you have to enter stamina and ultra stamina mode which really turns the phone into a dumb large phone since you'll have to give up all the cool smart features for a very reduced battery consumption. the battery barely discharges if it is inactive and that gives me a comfort feel that i wont loose charge when the device is not in use"
"I have been switching from a phone to another for a while and the last phone I got was the Nexus 6P. I tried LG, Motorola, Samsung, HTC, iPhone, and Nexus 6P. I never gave Sony a chance, because I haven't seen them doing any major advertisements so I assumed it isn't a great phone. When I used the phone, I regret not buying Sony phones before. The phone is so user friendly and so clean of a software, even better than the pure Android like the ones, which comes in Nexus lineup.Basically you are buying quality !! a product that is well build and carefully crafted, and the software is perfectly modified.The only thing I don't like is the finger prints left on the back of the phone and the lack of the number of cases available to purchase.Update: Sadly I returned the phone, because I was getting Black Screen of Death during my calls. I can't do anything when I get it until the person I am talking to hang up then the screen turn back on. I tried all the fixes, but none of them worked, so I ended up returning it. I liked the phone so much, but I don't want to risk buying a phone that has a common issue since the Z2."
"This phone are really amazing!!! I purchase the phone trough Quality Deals Shop Center and for my surprise the phone came with the UCH10 Quick Charger and an amazing headphones. like ever, Sony make the best smartphones. the camera is really amazing, I'm impressed because the quality is superior from others high ended phones. the phone is simply beautiful and it looks PREMIUM. The fingerprint scanner works really amazing, much better than iphone 6s and galaxy S6. the screen is GORGEOUS, I can't explain it in words. the stereo speakers sounds very clear and super cool, but my old Xperia Z2 sounds a little louder than Z5 Premium. the led light is situated in the corner of the phone and is very small, for me, the led light of my old Z2 looks a lot better than this, positioned in the superior speaker and it was much larger than the Z5 one.The battery life is AMAZING and the quick charger works excelent, the phone charges completely in 1 hour approximately."
"Best phone I ever had!!Beautiful, fast and sexy!"
"although the battery does not last long, as they say."
Buen producto
When I plug in my headphones they dont work.
"Absolutely best android phone! Don't listen to the haters here, most likely user error!"
"Nice smartphone, get heat a little like other phones, just the battery life is not longer that the previous version, but it's a good smartphone. 4k recorder consume to much battery and resources. The only fault in the phone."
It is the wrong model but is OK.
"Not very good, is accessible for cost and quality"
"Super sexy, feels great in the hand...however, upon inserting SIM and turning on, a software update loaded, and now my contacts, and ability to dial a number, do not work! WTH?"
"I don't know why it was opened when I get it. The ups package was good. Also, the system language was already set with Chinese."
very good product.
"Extremely happy with this phone. It was finally time to upgrade from my Xperia TL, and when I got a chance to try out the Z5 I was more than satisfied. I'm on a family plan with phones including an Iphone 6 and a Samsung Galaxy 7, and I definitely preferred the Z5. Super fast camera with the best image sensor I've seen (also excellent in low light), a super sharp display-even in sunny conditions, super snappy operation and just an overall premium feel. I hope that Sony can get their issues with US carriers sorted out because more people should have access to the excellent Xperia line of phones."
Love it. Got here quick works flawlessly. No complaints about the phone. Takes a bit to get used to from iPhone and typing/browsing still annoying but everything else superior. Doubt I'll be going back to iPhone.
"I have been a loyal Sony Xperia Z1S and Z3 user and wanted to upgrade to the Z5. Xperia Z5 crashed repeatedly during startup process and then continued to do so with minimal use, even trying to open main menu screens. Factory reset did not fix anything. Returned it within a day and I'll have to wait for the next model to see if they ironed out the kinks."
Seller 100% recommended. He complied with everything. !!!
"I felt obligated to leave a feedback because some of the negative and inaccurate reviews users were leaving led me to believe that this phone was not a good buy. I just had the all great and mighty Samsung S7 and I absolutely hated the phone! It ran a bit sluggish, in addition, out of the box the battery was horrible, and I am coming from the Sony Xperia Z3 which I only had to charge once a day. I returned the S7 $800 paperweight that T-Mobile attempted to charge me and decided to purchase the Xperia Z5 since I loved the Z3 so much, but with some of the negative reviews I almost did not purchased the phone. I am so happy that I did not listen to the negative reviews and did it. It has been less than 24hours and this phone is absolutely amazing! I have it running on T-Mobile’s sim card and the service is great, no overheating, in addition I purchased a solid case to keep this amazing phone protected. I think that this is the best phone on the market right now and I wish that people would provide accurate feedback so that others who want to take a chance will also have an amazing experience as I am having. Please, if you are thinking about this phone and already know how solid Sony is, don’t get despair by the negative reviews, take a chance on a brand that you know and get the phone! Life is too short to just settle for anything, treat yourself and live your life!"
"Coming from a Galaxy S3 (with Zerolemon extended battery) that lasted 3+ years, the difference between the two phones is night and day. Definitely larger, less curvy, and thinner. The Z5 feels very premium if not a little on the fragile side. I've heard reports in the past (especially with the Z3) of the screens self-cracking, so I wasn't going to take any chances with this phone. I also ordered a tempered glass screen protector and a clear TPU case and threw those on before anything else.It's only been a few days, and these are my observations thus far:Spent the first two days playing with the Z5 and updating it. An update was available right out of the box. This can be done either through the phone itself or by connecting it to the computer and installing Sony's Xperia Companion software (which I didn't mind.) There were a lot of features to play with. Won't be getting bored any time soon. One thing to note: the volume buttons are on the lower-right side of the phone, as opposed to the Galaxy S3's upper-left side. It takes some getting used to. Some have said that it's simply poor placement, but it's really not that bad. It might be annoying if you're right-handed, but I could see left-handers having an easier time. It's left-hander friendly! And for the record, I could care less about the lack of fingerprint scanner support. I don't think it's a needed feature, and definitely not a deal-breaker. My S3 didn't have one, so I don't believe I'm missing out.Today was my first real day of having it in my pocket while at work. I don't wear tight pants, but the phone is thinner than what I'm used to, so I remained aware of the potential of it bending in my pocket. I charged the phone overnight to 100%. As of this writing (around 4:13 PM), I'm down to 76%. Granted, I wasn't using the camera heavily or playing any games yet or had the screen on for a prolonged period of time. But as it stands, I can easily get two days out of this thing.Here's something of interest: I guess Android 6.0 has a feature called ""Double-tap to Wake"", where you can simply double-tap the display and it'll come on so you can unlock the device from there. Very nice feature! I always think that I'm wearing down the power button with the constant screen turning on and off. BUT, over the course of the work day and having the phone in my pocket, I noticed on two occasions that the flashlight mode was shining in my pocket. Somehow, it enabled itself in my pocket and I know I locked the device. I also noticed that my bluetooth was on, and I had no recollection of turning that on as well. I suspect that the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature is so sensitive that it's turning on in my pocket, sliding around, and sliding the notification bar down and pressing random settings off and on. Even in my pocket, the screen must be very sensitive! There's apparently a ""Glove mode"" that makes it easier to interact with the screen while wearing gloves. This mode was turned off. I've since turned off the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature. I'll report back if I'm still having issues with this."
"Love it best smartphone in the market and the cámara it's amazing. It's better than a IPhone 6S Plus ;) 📷📲👌Sony make it big again, they ate doing Better :3 <3"
"Phone is good and has good uniformity over other Android phone, but falls short of iPhone uniformity. Touch sensitivity isn't perfect, nor is the keyboard very good. Language support is poor; keyboards available for only east Asian languages.Otherwise, aesthetically pleasing."
"GOOD QUALITY, HAPPY"
"The best Android experience that's not a Nexus phone. Great, if not awesome, audio and video quality."
"This review is after 3 months of ownership:The first few weeks I was pleased with the phone in general. All the basic performance requirements of a phone at the price point were met. After a few months of use, there have been some significant issues and I am now at a point where I need to replace the device all together. This is really disappointing because I usually get 2 to 3 product cycles out of a phone;I bought this to replace my S5 Galaxy. Here is a chronological list of issues developing1) 1 week - Blue tooth connectivity/call prioritization. Improved after system update2) 1 month - Overheating issues &coating on lens started to scratch off... The camera quality suffered as a result.3) 2 months - Vertical lines in the display when first turned on, that would fade away.4) 3 months - Vertical lines became like looking through a mesh, eventually the screen completely failed. It just displays lines and shades.I hope this helps, don't make the same mistake: buy a Samsung S7"
I've always been a fan of Sony but after this purchase my opinion changed! I just bought it in May 13th and for no reason it stopped working yesterday. It had 50% battery life and out of the blue it just blacked out and I was never able to turn it on again. I am in U.S. for a limited period of time to visit my family and it is so frustrating because all the memories I had with my family in this trip were gone with the phone.I would like to know what Amazon is going to do about it because I am leaving the country in a week and I feel completely deceived.
"I thought I gonna have earing kit, but no. The phone is good. Before I was using Xperia Z, this one is just perfect"
One of the best phones I have owned it is definitely a choice for android users who want something like Iphone but without their apps etc.
Phone is VERY slooooooow. Battery life is very poor. I never make it through the day. Just ordered a OnePlus 3.
"I really thought this cellphone was going to meet my expectations , but the camera isnt different from a Samsung Galaxy 5s,I had a doubt before i purchase this phone between LG5 and this one, and after reading all the descriptions and comparing i decided to get this one but now i dont even know if i made the right choice."
very good product
EXELLENT
The phone I am using is good
"Received the phone yesterday and it is as expected. I haven't gotten the device soaked yet but it is fast, runs cool, and the display looks great even in direct daylight. Didn't get outrageously warm and the battery life looks like it will outperform what reviews led me to expect. I didn't really care about or want the finger print scanner so I am not torn up about that. The phone itself is understated ""chic"" I suppose. Its solid in the hand, has a nice little loop notch which was an unexpected surprise that will probably go unused here.I am particularly impressed with the headphone output on this phone. resolution and quality of output are on par with an HTC One M8. The M8 has the edge in absolute power output but this phone is capable of making good use of a Tidal account on the go. Has enough power to drive the Shure Srh-1840 to uncomfortable levels. Doesn't seem to mind hte ultra-low impedance of the Shure SE846 although absolute refinement of sound seems to take a slight hit compared to the HTC one M8. Four hours of Tidal streaming @ CD quality seemed to eat about 10% of the phones battery driving the SRH-1840 and the screen mostly off which I consider to be another solid showing.Especially for the money, I feel its quite a nice device."
Very cool phone water proof and nfc and other black megic Sony is very good company
"Great phone, I just couldn't get past my love of the iPhone and adjust to Android. The camera on this phone does some amazing things."
Awesome phone
"This replaced a 6 month old Samsung Galaxy Note 5. I did the MM software update, 6.0. set it up for my needs and have used it since. I have had zero problems, zero overheating. It is much faster & has better battery life than my Samsung. Possibly because it is not loaded with AT&T bloatware. But, I could not be happier."
Amazing and flawless.
I got the Z5 for the bigger screen and longer battery life. So far my phone is performing to my expectations.
"Having been a apple owner and recently used the Galaxy S4,S5,S6. I can say this phone is right with them. Been using it for around 5 days and love it. Strongly suggest this phone to anyone. The build is what I love the most. Very elegant design."
Very good phone everything is very quick and easy to use and I have had no problems so far.Edit: After a long time of use I began to notice that if you use 4k or full hd 60fps recording the phone gets extremely hot and overheats. Actually no its not just those two even if you open or use an app for a long time it overheats and this is a problem i've noticed in all xperia phones which is disappoint considering I absolutely love everything else about them. If this issue is fixed then this phone would be perfect but other than that nothing else has gave me problems.
"Coming from a Z3, I had very very high expectations, but due to the recent development of a flickering display issue, I decided to give the Z5 a chance.Within 3 hours of arrival, and fresh off a system update, the phone was shutting down the camera app due to thermal issues, and I was getting notifications about temperature problems. Whether I was taking 8mp images or 60fps full hd, same problem. If a phone's primary advertising feature is its camera's capabilities, those features should work.The display has a very odd tint to it, making whites appear red/purple, and giving other colors a weird cast, regardless of the xreality settings...maybe they put too much red in their Triluminos display technology...Adjusting the color calibration brings it closer to white, but gives things a greyish cast as well.While attempting to charge the phone using the supplied adapter, it was discharging faster than it could charge...all I was doing was downloading apps through google play, and had the screen on.Maybe I just got a dud, but Sony support killed it for me when their only solution was to check the return policy of the store from which I purchased, and then get sarcastic with me when I asked if that's all they were able to suggest.If this were priced as a midrange phone, I'd be more lenient, but at more than half a grand this is just unacceptable.Given that Sony has shuddered direct US sales of this phone, and their support is all overseas, I think I'm done with Sony Mobile. Too bad, too, cause the Z3 really was incredible."
I like the phone but the battery doesn't last long I had my phone off the charger for a half hour and it already lost 10% power
"the phone get very hot, the last sony xperia 1 did not get hot. do you have any suggestion to solving this problem?"
Great phone. Works just fine outside the US
good :) perfect ;)
Device Arrive without headphones
Great phone with excellent build quality. Love having an unlocked phone with no carrier bloatware. It is a little on the big side for me and it is especially noticeable with the squared off shape of the phone.
"I love the phone but after a week having the Xperia Z5 I'm experiencing an issue with the touch screen. When I go to unlock the phone, the emergency call screen will pop up then once I have the phone unlocked, the phone will open up multiple icons by itself. the touch screen is going haywire, I turned my phone on and off countless of times and it still opens up random apps without me touching the screen."
It's an amazing phone!
Amazing cellphone
"This is an amazing phone! Although Version buyers beware, this phone does not support CDMA, same as Sprint. I ended up switching carriers but I needed to anyway. Besides that I love this phone, I had an IPhone 6 and I'm already forgetting about it."
"This new phone is driving me and everyone whoever tried to turn it on crazy! I am a huge sony fan, and believe me when I say I received a piece of crap! I've got it for about a week, now I can't even call it a phone! It is a USELESS METAL PAD with a red flash. It keeps crushing and rebooting for no reason, it sometimes even crush and reboots during former reboot!! So far, I only succeed at sending one 10-word-long text message with multiple attempts. I can't believe how could the company let such crapy product goes into the market!"
Severe fever
"I was looking for a phone that had an aluminum body and was water resistant. I also wanted an unlocked phone because I do tend to leave the states every once and a while. I've had it about a month now and I am very please with it - the phone feels solid in your hand, it has a great weight to it. The camera is AWESOME with the quick auto-focus feature, the pictures are beautiful with a 23MP camera. The battery life is pretty good too, and it charges pretty quickly when using the factory charger, so if you're on the go you can squeeze in a few hours of battery life with 15 minutes of charging.I was a little apprehensive that the screen isn't gorilla glass; my screens tend to crack over time, which is why a screen protector and case were a MUST! This phone is SOLID, it does have a little software quirks since it is unlocked - like a 'Cell Information' notification that can be a bit of a pain to keep off the notification bar (If you want to remove it you have to go to Settings->Sound and Notifications->App Notifications->Cell Information->click on the i in a circle-> Force Stop -- the notification will come back upon restart); a small Snapchat quirk that makes you do a bit of extra work to get to the right screen (some of the menu options dont function on certain screens, you have to go to the main camera screen before being able to see other people's stories). I am sure there are other small app quirks too, but these small quirks are easy for me to look over for a great water-resistant aluminum bodied unlocked smartphone that costs under 500 bucks. Recommended for those that like solid unlocked android phones. Slap a screen protector on it, get a case, and live yo life like a boss with a new phone."
"Excellent product, well packed and shiped."
"All is perfect, thank"
Gets too hot and battery life doesn't last more than 6 hours
"The best phone I've had since my XPERIA Z3! Sony knows how to make a beautiful, speedy, and premium-looking device. If you're looking for an Android-based phone, look no further, the XPERIA Z5 is the best I've had yet!"
"Awesome phone. The camera is probably one of the best available. Only problem is that it is the most delicate mobile phone on the market. The phone fell out of my pants pocket, and even with a case, the screen cracked. I have had iPhones and Galaxy phones in the past that have survived many falls with zero issues, but this Sony was unable to endure one fall. Sony has a great product, but they cheaped out on the screen. I called Sony to see if I could pay them for the repair, taking full responsibility for the drop, but the phone rep stated that they do not do out-of-warranty work for US customers."
The product has failed and I have no solutions by the seller !!!!!.Too bad all !!!!!. When not working no response from seller !!!
"Nice phone, the only thing is that it does not include headphones."
"The best Android experience that's not a Nexus phone. Great, if not awesome, audio and video quality."
"i am a loyal Sony fan, using Sony phones since their W series of walkman phones, W700, W750I W850i, and then used xperia Z1, Z2, Z3, and now i got my hands on Xperia Z5. first of all i must confess xperia Z2 was the best xperia series phone till now. as far as Z5 is concerned, it is a typical Sony phone with awesome camera, 4k video, brilliant walkman and unbelievable bright resolution, but having said that, there is no WOW factor. nothing EXTRA ORDINARY new. And i don't blame sony for this. for couple of years, Android cellphones industry is in static situation and nothing new or awesome is coming out. every renowned brand's flagship phones are circling around, camera, water proof, sound, finger prints, resolution etc. nothing special or extra ordinary coming out. i gave 4 stars because battery life is not improved, i was expecting better performance in battery life."
"I have HTC for eight years, is my first Sony. Is a rocket!!!!"
best phone I have had so far
"I'm a big gamer, and I don't need to go over those features for you for the thousandth time, but after deciding not to upgrade to the Sony Xperia Z3 or Z3+ due to the heating issues, and a couple other reasons, I drooled over the Xperia Z5 specs for months waiting to buy this phone in the U.S. with a warranty. I finally got it through Amazon, and this phone is absolutely blazing fast! However the number the Sony Guy provided me to purchase an additional warranty didn't pan out, I still feel this phone deserves a full 5 star review. The camera, the graphics, the power, The playstation integration for gamers, this phone is exactly what I have been waiting for to upgrade for my trusty Xperia Play R800 and I couldn't be happier. Unless of course it slid out into a PlayStation controller like the old R800's but the display, camera, and about everything else make this phone so vastly superior in every aspect. I'm not even mad the U.S. version didn't get a finger print scanner as there is a ton of apps for that, and that wasn't a selling point anyways for me. I am in love all over again with another great Xperia!"
"I have used Xperia z5 for one week now.Super camera. I now don't need to carry compact camera with me. Just aim and shoot with my Z5. Focus fast and no more blurry pictures. Display is sharp and clear even under bright California sky. Phone function is as great as expected. Web browsing is fast... I don't use my I-pad anymore. Sorry, I had to move to AT&T from Verizon... more than 15 years loyal customer."
Loving the phone so far. However reception isn't that great in certain areas. The camera is phenomenal for a phone.
"I absolutely love this phone! Huge upgrade from the Sony Xperia Z3V that I previously was using, so it is actually my first time using Lollipop and also many other features that the Z5 has to offer. Buttery Smooth performance along with speed and the camera is just amazing, so many great things about this phone that I can go on about. I have read that people are upset about Sony not including the fingerprint scanner from the power button which to me is not a big deal since I have not yet to use it on my previous devices so I honestly could care less of the feature and I also doubt that I would ever use it if it was included. However this phone is great and I am enjoying it."
"I am impressed with the quality of this phone,The Xperia Z5 display excellent color reproduction and sharpness, has an excellent image, the glass screen feels sturdy, the software and hardware environment respond quickly and smooth, I have been using continuously and has no overheating by the continued use of streaming as z3,The Xperia Z5 is very well put together, with Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back, an aluminum frame and rubber bumpers on the corners to help absorb shock if the phone is dropped,The camera has truly excellent auto-focus,regarding the battery of sony phone I do not see a big difference compared to other phones like Samsung or IPhone S6,but The biggest departure in design terms, is the look of the power button. Sony’s trademark protruding chrome-effect circle, which has been around for years, has now been replaced by an elongated lozenge, slightly inset from the edge to prevent you accidentally pressing it.I particularly recommend this phone to a friend."
Upgraded to this phone from a T-Mobile Xperia Z (3 1/2 years old) which was locked; therefore I'm using the unlocked Z5 on T-Mobile and have not had any issues. I have a LTE signal on the device. One of the biggest pros for the phone is that its nearly stock android and all apps except a few can be removed completely from the device (for example i was able to remove the Google+ app which i was unable to do before). The phone is fast and fluid and i have not had any lagg on it. For me the camera is superb but I'm not a big photographer unless I'm at a concert or something. The auto-focus is extremely fast to where i don't even see it focus unless i manually use my finger to focus on a particular item. No regrets with my purchase
"Received the phone yesterday and it is as expected. I haven't gotten the device soaked yet but it is fast, runs cool, and the display looks great even in direct daylight. Didn't get outrageously warm and the battery life looks like it will outperform what reviews led me to expect. I didn't really care about or want the finger print scanner so I am not torn up about that. The phone itself is understated ""chic"" I suppose. Its solid in the hand, has a nice little loop notch which was an unexpected surprise that will probably go unused here.I am particularly impressed with the headphone output on this phone. resolution and quality of output are on par with an HTC One M8. The M8 has the edge in absolute power output but this phone is capable of making good use of a Tidal account on the go. Has enough power to drive the Shure Srh-1840 to uncomfortable levels. Doesn't seem to mind hte ultra-low impedance of the Shure SE846 although absolute refinement of sound seems to take a slight hit compared to the HTC one M8. Four hours of Tidal streaming @ CD quality seemed to eat about 10% of the phones battery driving the SRH-1840 and the screen mostly off which I consider to be another solid showing.Especially for the money, I feel its quite a nice device."
Wifi and service sucks through this phone for some reason. Probably won't buy another one.
"Even when this item is sold as ""New"" the box was open and dirty, as when it has been manipulated by several hands, the cell phone plastic cover was from other cell phone because it was shorter and in different shape. When I turned on the cell it started to update some apps, which is normal, and it was trying to update the software version, the cell phone tried several times without success, I had to do it using my computer. Definitely not recommended for people who likes products just ""plug and play"". The cell phone by itself is really good."
I have only had Sony cell phones for over 10 years. Nice phone and very happy with this purchase.
I love it. The purchase was easy the delivery fast
"Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White, EXCELENTE PRODUCTO"
"I got this for its waterproof features, and it is still amazing for a year-old model."
I have seen in the phone problem
Love it
"This is a really solid no nonsense phone , the user interface is great, the camera/video is fantastic, its got the latest software, the sound quality is Surprisingly clear and sharp.If your looking for an alternative to apple/Samsung that matches all the specs Sony has a winner with this phone, I would highly recommend"
"Phone is awesome!! Fast response, vibrant screen, great camera and very nice native apps. Been confronting some battery life issues... But it appears to be software behavior, hardware is perfectly good."
very good product.
"Extremely happy with this phone. It was finally time to upgrade from my Xperia TL, and when I got a chance to try out the Z5 I was more than satisfied. I'm on a family plan with phones including an Iphone 6 and a Samsung Galaxy 7, and I definitely preferred the Z5. Super fast camera with the best image sensor I've seen (also excellent in low light), a super sharp display-even in sunny conditions, super snappy operation and just an overall premium feel. I hope that Sony can get their issues with US carriers sorted out because more people should have access to the excellent Xperia line of phones."
Love it. Got here quick works flawlessly. No complaints about the phone. Takes a bit to get used to from iPhone and typing/browsing still annoying but everything else superior. Doubt I'll be going back to iPhone.
"I have been a loyal Sony Xperia Z1S and Z3 user and wanted to upgrade to the Z5. Xperia Z5 crashed repeatedly during startup process and then continued to do so with minimal use, even trying to open main menu screens. Factory reset did not fix anything. Returned it within a day and I'll have to wait for the next model to see if they ironed out the kinks."
Seller 100% recommended. He complied with everything. !!!
"I felt obligated to leave a feedback because some of the negative and inaccurate reviews users were leaving led me to believe that this phone was not a good buy. I just had the all great and mighty Samsung S7 and I absolutely hated the phone! It ran a bit sluggish, in addition, out of the box the battery was horrible, and I am coming from the Sony Xperia Z3 which I only had to charge once a day. I returned the S7 $800 paperweight that T-Mobile attempted to charge me and decided to purchase the Xperia Z5 since I loved the Z3 so much, but with some of the negative reviews I almost did not purchased the phone. I am so happy that I did not listen to the negative reviews and did it. It has been less than 24hours and this phone is absolutely amazing! I have it running on T-Mobile’s sim card and the service is great, no overheating, in addition I purchased a solid case to keep this amazing phone protected. I think that this is the best phone on the market right now and I wish that people would provide accurate feedback so that others who want to take a chance will also have an amazing experience as I am having. Please, if you are thinking about this phone and already know how solid Sony is, don’t get despair by the negative reviews, take a chance on a brand that you know and get the phone! Life is too short to just settle for anything, treat yourself and live your life!"
"Coming from a Galaxy S3 (with Zerolemon extended battery) that lasted 3+ years, the difference between the two phones is night and day. Definitely larger, less curvy, and thinner. The Z5 feels very premium if not a little on the fragile side. I've heard reports in the past (especially with the Z3) of the screens self-cracking, so I wasn't going to take any chances with this phone. I also ordered a tempered glass screen protector and a clear TPU case and threw those on before anything else.It's only been a few days, and these are my observations thus far:Spent the first two days playing with the Z5 and updating it. An update was available right out of the box. This can be done either through the phone itself or by connecting it to the computer and installing Sony's Xperia Companion software (which I didn't mind.) There were a lot of features to play with. Won't be getting bored any time soon. One thing to note: the volume buttons are on the lower-right side of the phone, as opposed to the Galaxy S3's upper-left side. It takes some getting used to. Some have said that it's simply poor placement, but it's really not that bad. It might be annoying if you're right-handed, but I could see left-handers having an easier time. It's left-hander friendly! And for the record, I could care less about the lack of fingerprint scanner support. I don't think it's a needed feature, and definitely not a deal-breaker. My S3 didn't have one, so I don't believe I'm missing out.Today was my first real day of having it in my pocket while at work. I don't wear tight pants, but the phone is thinner than what I'm used to, so I remained aware of the potential of it bending in my pocket. I charged the phone overnight to 100%. As of this writing (around 4:13 PM), I'm down to 76%. Granted, I wasn't using the camera heavily or playing any games yet or had the screen on for a prolonged period of time. But as it stands, I can easily get two days out of this thing.Here's something of interest: I guess Android 6.0 has a feature called ""Double-tap to Wake"", where you can simply double-tap the display and it'll come on so you can unlock the device from there. Very nice feature! I always think that I'm wearing down the power button with the constant screen turning on and off. BUT, over the course of the work day and having the phone in my pocket, I noticed on two occasions that the flashlight mode was shining in my pocket. Somehow, it enabled itself in my pocket and I know I locked the device. I also noticed that my bluetooth was on, and I had no recollection of turning that on as well. I suspect that the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature is so sensitive that it's turning on in my pocket, sliding around, and sliding the notification bar down and pressing random settings off and on. Even in my pocket, the screen must be very sensitive! There's apparently a ""Glove mode"" that makes it easier to interact with the screen while wearing gloves. This mode was turned off. I've since turned off the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature. I'll report back if I'm still having issues with this."
"Love it best smartphone in the market and the cámara it's amazing. It's better than a IPhone 6S Plus ;) 📷📲👌Sony make it big again, they ate doing Better :3 <3"
"Phone is good and has good uniformity over other Android phone, but falls short of iPhone uniformity. Touch sensitivity isn't perfect, nor is the keyboard very good. Language support is poor; keyboards available for only east Asian languages.Otherwise, aesthetically pleasing."
"GOOD QUALITY, HAPPY"

"This new phone is driving me and everyone whoever tried to turn it on crazy! I am a huge sony fan, and believe me when I say I received a piece of crap! I've got it for about a week, now I can't even call it a phone! It is a USELESS METAL PAD with a red flash. It keeps crushing and rebooting for no reason, it sometimes even crush and reboots during former reboot!! So far, I only succeed at sending one 10-word-long text message with multiple attempts. I can't believe how could the company let such crapy product goes into the market!"
Very cool phone water proof and nfc and other black megic Sony is very good company
"Great phone, I just couldn't get past my love of the iPhone and adjust to Android. The camera on this phone does some amazing things."
Awesome phone
"This replaced a 6 month old Samsung Galaxy Note 5. I did the MM software update, 6.0. set it up for my needs and have used it since. I have had zero problems, zero overheating. It is much faster & has better battery life than my Samsung. Possibly because it is not loaded with AT&T bloatware. But, I could not be happier."
Amazing and flawless.
I got the Z5 for the bigger screen and longer battery life. So far my phone is performing to my expectations.
"Having been a apple owner and recently used the Galaxy S4,S5,S6. I can say this phone is right with them. Been using it for around 5 days and love it. Strongly suggest this phone to anyone. The build is what I love the most. Very elegant design."
Very good phone everything is very quick and easy to use and I have had no problems so far.Edit: After a long time of use I began to notice that if you use 4k or full hd 60fps recording the phone gets extremely hot and overheats. Actually no its not just those two even if you open or use an app for a long time it overheats and this is a problem i've noticed in all xperia phones which is disappoint considering I absolutely love everything else about them. If this issue is fixed then this phone would be perfect but other than that nothing else has gave me problems.
"Coming from a Z3, I had very very high expectations, but due to the recent development of a flickering display issue, I decided to give the Z5 a chance.Within 3 hours of arrival, and fresh off a system update, the phone was shutting down the camera app due to thermal issues, and I was getting notifications about temperature problems. Whether I was taking 8mp images or 60fps full hd, same problem. If a phone's primary advertising feature is its camera's capabilities, those features should work.The display has a very odd tint to it, making whites appear red/purple, and giving other colors a weird cast, regardless of the xreality settings...maybe they put too much red in their Triluminos display technology...Adjusting the color calibration brings it closer to white, but gives things a greyish cast as well.While attempting to charge the phone using the supplied adapter, it was discharging faster than it could charge...all I was doing was downloading apps through google play, and had the screen on.Maybe I just got a dud, but Sony support killed it for me when their only solution was to check the return policy of the store from which I purchased, and then get sarcastic with me when I asked if that's all they were able to suggest.If this were priced as a midrange phone, I'd be more lenient, but at more than half a grand this is just unacceptable.Given that Sony has shuddered direct US sales of this phone, and their support is all overseas, I think I'm done with Sony Mobile. Too bad, too, cause the Z3 really was incredible."
"the phone get very hot, the last sony xperia 1 did not get hot. do you have any suggestion to solving this problem?"
Great phone. Works just fine outside the US
good :) perfect ;)
Device Arrive without headphones
Great phone with excellent build quality. Love having an unlocked phone with no carrier bloatware. It is a little on the big side for me and it is especially noticeable with the squared off shape of the phone.
"I love the phone but after a week having the Xperia Z5 I'm experiencing an issue with the touch screen. When I go to unlock the phone, the emergency call screen will pop up then once I have the phone unlocked, the phone will open up multiple icons by itself. the touch screen is going haywire, I turned my phone on and off countless of times and it still opens up random apps without me touching the screen."
It's an amazing phone!
Amazing cellphone
"This is an amazing phone! Although Version buyers beware, this phone does not support CDMA, same as Sprint. I ended up switching carriers but I needed to anyway. Besides that I love this phone, I had an IPhone 6 and I'm already forgetting about it."
"This new phone is driving me and everyone whoever tried to turn it on crazy! I am a huge sony fan, and believe me when I say I received a piece of crap! I've got it for about a week, now I can't even call it a phone! It is a USELESS METAL PAD with a red flash.

Severe fever
"I was looking for a phone that had an aluminum body and was water resistant. I also wanted an unlocked phone because I do tend to leave the states every once and a while. I've had it about a month now and I am very please with it - the phone feels solid in your hand, it has a great weight to it. The camera is AWESOME with the quick auto-focus feature, the pictures are beautiful with a 23MP camera. The battery life is pretty good too, and it charges pretty quickly when using the factory charger, so if you're on the go you can squeeze in a few hours of battery life with 15 minutes of charging.I was a little apprehensive that the screen isn't gorilla glass; my screens tend to crack over time, which is why a screen protector and case were a MUST! This phone is SOLID, it does have a little software quirks since it is unlocked - like a 'Cell Information' notification that can be a bit of a pain to keep off the notification bar (If you want to remove it you have to go to Settings->Sound and Notifications->App Notifications->Cell Information->click on the i in a circle-> Force Stop -- the notification will come back upon restart); a small Snapchat quirk that makes you do a bit of extra work to get to the right screen (some of the menu options dont function on certain screens, you have to go to the main camera screen before being able to see other people's stories). I am sure there are other small app quirks too, but these small quirks are easy for me to look over for a great water-resistant aluminum bodied unlocked smartphone that costs under 500 bucks. Recommended for those that like solid unlocked android phones. Slap a screen protector on it, get a case, and live yo life like a boss with a new phone."
"Excellent product, well packed and shiped."
"All is perfect, thank"
Gets too hot and battery life doesn't last more than 6 hours
"The best phone I've had since my XPERIA Z3! Sony knows how to make a beautiful, speedy, and premium-looking device. If you're looking for an Android-based phone, look no further, the XPERIA Z5 is the best I've had yet!"
"Awesome phone. The camera is probably one of the best available. Only problem is that it is the most delicate mobile phone on the market. The phone fell out of my pants pocket, and even with a case, the screen cracked. I have had iPhones and Galaxy phones in the past that have survived many falls with zero issues, but this Sony was unable to endure one fall. Sony has a great product, but they cheaped out on the screen. I called Sony to see if I could pay them for the repair, taking full responsibility for the drop, but the phone rep stated that they do not do out-of-warranty work for US customers."
The product has failed and I have no solutions by the seller !!!!!.Too bad all !!!!!. When not working no response from seller !!!
"Nice phone, the only thing is that it does not include headphones."
"The best Android experience that's not a Nexus phone. Great, if not awesome, audio and video quality."
"i am a loyal Sony fan, using Sony phones since their W series of walkman phones, W700, W750I W850i, and then used xperia Z1, Z2, Z3, and now i got my hands on Xperia Z5. first of all i must confess xperia Z2 was the best xperia series phone till now. as far as Z5 is concerned, it is a typical Sony phone with awesome camera, 4k video, brilliant walkman and unbelievable bright resolution, but having said that, there is no WOW factor. nothing EXTRA ORDINARY new. And i don't blame sony for this. for couple of years, Android cellphones industry is in static situation and nothing new or awesome is coming out. every renowned brand's flagship phones are circling around, camera, water proof, sound, finger prints, resolution etc. nothing special or extra ordinary coming out. i gave 4 stars because battery life is not improved, i was expecting better performance in battery life."
"I have HTC for eight years, is my first Sony. Is a rocket!!!!"
best phone I have had so far
"I'm a big gamer, and I don't need to go over those features for you for the thousandth time, but after deciding not to upgrade to the Sony Xperia Z3 or Z3+ due to the heating issues, and a couple other reasons, I drooled over the Xperia Z5 specs for months waiting to buy this phone in the U.S. with a warranty. I finally got it through Amazon, and this phone is absolutely blazing fast! However the number the Sony Guy provided me to purchase an additional warranty didn't pan out, I still feel this phone deserves a full 5 star review. The camera, the graphics, the power, The playstation integration for gamers, this phone is exactly what I have been waiting for to upgrade for my trusty Xperia Play R800 and I couldn't be happier. Unless of course it slid out into a PlayStation controller like the old R800's but the display, camera, and about everything else make this phone so vastly superior in every aspect. I'm not even mad the U.S. version didn't get a finger print scanner as there is a ton of apps for that, and that wasn't a selling point anyways for me. I am in love all over again with another great Xperia!"
"I have used Xperia z5 for one week now.Super camera. I now don't need to carry compact camera with me. Just aim and shoot with my Z5. Focus fast and no more blurry pictures. Display is sharp and clear even under bright California sky. Phone function is as great as expected. Web browsing is fast... I don't use my I-pad anymore. Sorry, I had to move to AT&T from Verizon... more than 15 years loyal customer."
Loving the phone so far. However reception isn't that great in certain areas. The camera is phenomenal for a phone.
"I absolutely love this phone! Huge upgrade from the Sony Xperia Z3V that I previously was using, so it is actually my first time using Lollipop and also many other features that the Z5 has to offer. Buttery Smooth performance along with speed and the camera is just amazing, so many great things about this phone that I can go on about. I have read that people are upset about Sony not including the fingerprint scanner from the power button which to me is not a big deal since I have not yet to use it on my previous devices so I honestly could care less of the feature and I also doubt that I would ever use it if it was included. However this phone is great and I am enjoying it."
"I am impressed with the quality of this phone,The Xperia Z5 display excellent color reproduction and sharpness, has an excellent image, the glass screen feels sturdy, the software and hardware environment respond quickly and smooth, I have been using continuously and has no overheating by the continued use of streaming as z3,The Xperia Z5 is very well put together, with Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back, an aluminum frame and rubber bumpers on the corners to help absorb shock if the phone is dropped,The camera has truly excellent auto-focus,regarding the battery of sony phone I do not see a big difference compared to other phones like Samsung or IPhone S6,but The biggest departure in design terms, is the look of the power button. Sony’s trademark protruding chrome-effect circle, which has been around for years, has now been replaced by an elongated lozenge, slightly inset from the edge to prevent you accidentally pressing it.I particularly recommend this phone to a friend."
Upgraded to this phone from a T-Mobile Xperia Z (3 1/2 years old) which was locked; therefore I'm using the unlocked Z5 on T-Mobile and have not had any issues. I have a LTE signal on the device. One of the biggest pros for the phone is that its nearly stock android and all apps except a few can be removed completely from the device (for example i was able to remove the Google+ app which i was unable to do before). The phone is fast and fluid and i have not had any lagg on it. For me the camera is superb but I'm not a big photographer unless I'm at a concert or something. The auto-focus is extremely fast to where i don't even see it focus unless i manually use my finger to focus on a particular item. No regrets with my purchase
"Received the phone yesterday and it is as expected. I haven't gotten the device soaked yet but it is fast, runs cool, and the display looks great even in direct daylight. Didn't get outrageously warm and the battery life looks like it will outperform what reviews led me to expect. I didn't really care about or want the finger print scanner so I am not torn up about that. The phone itself is understated ""chic"" I suppose. Its solid in the hand, has a nice little loop notch which was an unexpected surprise that will probably go unused here.I am particularly impressed with the headphone output on this phone. resolution and quality of output are on par with an HTC One M8. The M8 has the edge in absolute power output but this phone is capable of making good use of a Tidal account on the go. Has enough power to drive the Shure Srh-1840 to uncomfortable levels. Doesn't seem to mind hte ultra-low impedance of the Shure SE846 although absolute refinement of sound seems to take a slight hit compared to the HTC one M8. Four hours of Tidal streaming @ CD quality seemed to eat about 10% of the phones battery driving the SRH-1840 and the screen mostly off which I consider to be another solid showing.Especially for the money, I feel its quite a nice device."
"This review is after 3 months of ownership:The first few weeks I was pleased with the phone in general. All the basic performance requirements of a phone at the price point were met. After a few months of use, there have been some significant issues and I am now at a point where I need to replace the device all together. This is really disappointing because I usually get 2 to 3 product cycles out of a phone;I bought this to replace my S5 Galaxy. Here is a chronological list of issues developing1) 1 week - Blue tooth connectivity/call prioritization. Improved after system update2) 1 month - Overheating issues &coating on lens started to scratch off... The camera quality suffered as a result.3) 2 months - Vertical lines in the display when first turned on, that would fade away.4) 3 months - Vertical lines became like looking through a mesh, eventually the screen completely failed. It just displays lines and shades.I hope this helps, don't make the same mistake: buy a Samsung S7"
I've always been a fan of Sony but after this purchase my opinion changed! I just bought it in May 13th and for no reason it stopped working yesterday. It had 50% battery life and out of the blue it just blacked out and I was never able to turn it on again. I am in U.S. for a limited period of time to visit my family and it is so frustrating because all the memories I had with my family in this trip were gone with the phone.I would like to know what Amazon is going to do about it because I am leaving the country in a week and I feel completely deceived.
"I thought I gonna have earing kit, but no. The phone is good. Before I was using Xperia Z, this one is just perfect"
One of the best phones I have owned it is definitely a choice for android users who want something like Iphone but without their apps etc.
Phone is VERY slooooooow. Battery life is very poor. I never make it through the day. Just ordered a OnePlus 3.
"I really thought this cellphone was going to meet my expectations , but the camera isnt different from a Samsung Galaxy 5s,I had a doubt before i purchase this phone between LG5 and this one, and after reading all the descriptions and comparing i decided to get this one but now i dont even know if i made the right choice."
very good product

I suspect that the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature is so sensitive that it's turning on in my pocket, sliding around, and sliding the notification bar down and pressing random settings off and on. Even in my pocket, the screen must be very sensitive! There's apparently a ""Glove mode"" that makes it easier to interact with the screen while wearing gloves. This mode was turned off. I've since turned off the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature. I'll report back if I'm still having issues with this."
"Love it best smartphone in the market and the cámara it's amazing. It's better than a IPhone 6S Plus ;) 📷📲👌Sony make it big again, they ate doing Better :3 <3"
"Phone is good and has good uniformity over other Android phone, but falls short of iPhone uniformity. Touch sensitivity isn't perfect, nor is the keyboard very good. Language support is poor; keyboards available for only east Asian languages.Otherwise, aesthetically pleasing."
"GOOD QUALITY, HAPPY"
Bad signal. Screen froze. Had it for 1 day and it was restarting and acting stupid... Nice camera but shoddy phone.
Very cool phone water proof and nfc and other black megic Sony is very good company
"Great phone, I just couldn't get past my love of the iPhone and adjust to Android. The camera on this phone does some amazing things."
Awesome phone
"This replaced a 6 month old Samsung Galaxy Note 5. I did the MM software update, 6.0. set it up for my needs and have used it since. I have had zero problems, zero overheating. It is much faster & has better battery life than my Samsung. Possibly because it is not loaded with AT&T bloatware. But, I could not be happier."
Amazing and flawless.
I got the Z5 for the bigger screen and longer battery life. So far my phone is performing to my expectations.
"Having been a apple owner and recently used the Galaxy S4,S5,S6. I can say this phone is right with them. Been using it for around 5 days and love it. Strongly suggest this phone to anyone. The build is what I love the most. Very elegant design."
Very good phone everything is very quick and easy to use and I have had no problems so far.Edit: After a long time of use I began to notice that if you use 4k or full hd 60fps recording the phone gets extremely hot and overheats. Actually no its not just those two even if you open or use an app for a long time it overheats and this is a problem i've noticed in all xperia phones which is disappoint considering I absolutely love everything else about them. If this issue is fixed then this phone would be perfect but other than that nothing else has gave me problems.
"Coming from a Z3, I had very very high expectations, but due to the recent development of a flickering display issue, I decided to give the Z5 a chance.Within 3 hours of arrival, and fresh off a system update, the phone was shutting down the camera app due to thermal issues, and I was getting notifications about temperature problems. Whether I was taking 8mp images or 60fps full hd, same problem. If a phone's primary advertising feature is its camera's capabilities, those features should work.The display has a very odd tint to it, making whites appear red/purple, and giving other colors a weird cast, regardless of the xreality settings...maybe they put too much red in their Triluminos display technology...Adjusting the color calibration brings it closer to white, but gives things a greyish cast as well.While attempting to charge the phone using the supplied adapter, it was discharging faster than it could charge...all I was doing was downloading apps through google play, and had the screen on.Maybe I just got a dud, but Sony support killed it for me when their only solution was to check the return policy of the store from which I purchased, and then get sarcastic with me when I asked if that's all they were able to suggest.If this were priced as a midrange phone, I'd be more lenient, but at more than half a grand this is just unacceptable.Given that Sony has shuddered direct US sales of this phone, and their support is all overseas, I think I'm done with Sony Mobile. Too bad, too, cause the Z3 really was incredible."
I like the phone but the battery doesn't last long I had my phone off the charger for a half hour and it already lost 10% power
