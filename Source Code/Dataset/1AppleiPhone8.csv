"Faulty product, non-existent customer service
            The camera doesn’t work, neither does the flash light. This has been a problem since unpacking the item. Eventually, both would work after resetting and restoring my iPhone but would then stop after a few days.I have dealt with this issue for over a month. Initially, I tried calling the seller multiple times and have left a voice message. Never heard from them. So I am now stuck with a faulty phone that works on its own terms.The seller was Lonestar Mobile.
            "
"Just don't do it.
            Leason learned with this one.  I received the phone a couple weeks ago, but waited for my daughter to get home from college for Christmas before activating it.  After she activated it, she was having problems sending messages, etc., so she went to the Verizon store for help.  She was told the serial number for the phone is blacklisted because it has been reported lost or stolen.  When we tried to re-active her old phone, her number had been blocked for fraud associated with the stolen/lost phone.  She and my husband were on the phone with Verizon last night for more than two hours trying to get this mess resolved.  Don't do it.  It's not worth it.  Just get a new phone.
            "
"Good quality for being refurbished
            Despite the basic packaging, I was quite impressed with the condition of the phone, it looked brand new without a single scratch, which was one of my main concerns, when purchasing a refurbished phone. It also came with nicely packaged; headphones, aux adapter cable, and a charger. What I like the most about this purchase, was the fact that it was SIM unlocked(read some reviews saying it wasn’t). I was able to insert my AT&T SIM card and have it work immediately without any complications, I was able to call/text people within minutes of activating the phone. I’ve only had this phone for a week now and so far nothing seems to raise any red flags yet, I’ll update my review if anything changes.
            "
"I wouldn’t do it 🤷🏽‍♂️
            Package arrived on time. But the phone was not unlocked as advertised
            "
"after I used this phone, it have some problems ...
            after I used this phone, it have some problems.it will automatically restart when I use it,especially charging.i was scared,because i have no extra money to change another phone.i was bothered by this problem.
            "
"Bad refurbished
            The screen was too dark even with brightness at 100% the screen didnt look the way is supposed to
            "
"Do not buy from this seller.
            I should be able to give zero stars. This is a scam. The phone I got is faulty and the charger never worked. I have to spend money to get it fixed and I have to buy a charger. I am reluctant to spend money to get it fixed because it might still not work. I am stuck with a useless piece of crap.
            "
"ME ESTAFO
            COMPRE UN IPHONE 8 DE 256 G TAL COMO ESTA EN LA PUBLICACION Y EN EL RECIBO DE COMPRA Y ASI ME LO COBRO. PERO CUANDO ME LO MANDO ERA UN IPHONE 8 DE 64 GB, CUYO VALOR OBVIAMENTE ES MENOR.ES UN PESIMO VENDEDOR, UN ESTAFADOR... TENGAN CUIDADOSI ALGO DE DECENCIA LE QUEDA QUE ME DEVUELVA EL VALOR DE LA DIFERENCIA.
            "
"Not really GSM Unlocked!
            Was told by Customer Service there was no way to unlock the phone and that it was GSM unlocked as stated. I contacted Apple who checked the number and found it was still registered to AT&T. I logged in and unlocked it from AT&T but this was not GSM unlocked. It was an AT&T phone. Hope the phone works better than Jem Jem's indifferent customer service.
            "
"DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!
            I bought this phone and it immediately started having problems and I try to contact the company but no response, I contacted amazon and one person told me i can mail it back for my money back,  i then talked to someone else who said the first person was wrong and that if i were to have sent my phone back (I Was waiting a day because I wanted to buy a new phone so i would have one) I would of not received any money and would be out a phone and money. I contacted the company again and they replied but are refusing at the very least a return, suggesting I take it to a ""repair shop"" and have them look at it. It freezes constantly and the volume doesn't work most of the time and at random times every day it makes a loud beeping sound and goes black for about a minute. I'm very disappointed in the whole situation.
            "
"No complaints
            I’ve had this phone for just over two weeks now, and I haven’t had any issues with it (:::knock on wood:::). My carrier is T-Mobile, so connecting to the network was as simple as transferring my sim card from my dinosaur 5s to this phone. I feel like I got what I paid for, and I am satisfied with my purchase.
            "
"we buy an unlocked iphone ?
            we buy an unlocked iphone and to open the screen it is asking for a code! very bad service
            "
"Phone didn’t work but customer service excellent!
            Phone did not work on the Verizon network but the customer service through the return process was excellent!
            "
"I just received the device and it came completely scratched ...
            I just received the device and it came completely scratched up and had a crack in the screen located  near ear piece speaker.
            "
"Description does not match the product received
            I’m so disappointed I bought 2 iPhone 8 64g in GOLD as the description says. But I ended up with two rose gold phones. I had gotten these as gifts that I needed to give as the person is leaving today, so now two middle aged men will be proud owners of a rose gold iPhone! 😦
            "
"Phone came in perfect condition
            There were a few small blemishes on the back of the phone that were only noticeable if you look really close.  Otherwise no scratches, dent, or anything else customers mentioned on either of the two phones that I ordered.  It came with a real Apple charger not a knockoff and the phone itself worked perfectly.  I saved $200 over buying a new phone and am super happy.
            "
"Needing Help
            I just received my phone yesterday and it works good and looks good. The reviews are correct, the Gold is the Rose Gold which is what I wanted! However, I have put in my Straight Talk SIM card and the data does not work. It says Verizon at the top and I've had an issue before buying a Verizon phone not working with my SIM card. I'm not sure what to do?
            "
"Dent and scratch free
            2 month ago I have purchased above iphone 8 with 64gb. we received in good condition and it is totally dent and scratc. h free. so far working perfectly.
            "
"Phone did work on CDMA networks such as Sprint
            The description claimed that it would work on any network and specifically listed Sprint.  When I took it to the Sprint store to get a SIM card and get the phone activated they ran the IMEI and said it would not work on their network as it was GSM and not CDMA.I was disappointed that there was no selection for CDMA in the product options.Would not recommend as you may not get a phone that will work on your network.
            "
"Apple iPhone 8, GSM Unlocked, 64G - Gold (Refurbished)
            Always afraid of refurbished products, but not bad at all wife hasn't complained yet lol its been over a year.
            "
"Old phone
            Dirty phone, scratched frames, quality not adequate
            "
"Strongly recommend
            It's the best. It looks like a new one. All functions work well. Seller also sent me a screen protector. I strongly recommend it.
            "
"I don't think Kanga Supply does a very in-depth quality assurance
            By reading some other reviews and based on my own experience I feel as though Kanga Supply, probably doesn't do a very intensive quality assurance on their products. If I could guess, they get a lot of refurbished used phones, which for the majority of the time work fine, but there are going to be quite a few phones that are faulty. The phone I received wouldn't even turn on, despite trying to charge it with 3 different chargers. I guess it's my fault for not looking at their website, where they make no guarantees that their products work. If you need a phone immediately, I wouldn't suggest buying from here, unless your willing to wait 3-4 business days for an exchange or refund.
            "
"Nice iPhone, no problems.
            iPhone didn't come in original packaging and with original accesses. Which was expected. Had couple very minor scratches, which is expected as well. It was fully unlocked (I have tested it). IMEI was not reported lost/stolen ether. Overall it's quite nice and for a good price.
            "
"Barely Functioned
            I should have known better- as soon as I tried to turn the phone on to set it up, there were problems. The phone was not responding to charging or me pressing the home/power buttons.I finally got it to turn on and assumed it was just a freak occurence (I was mistaken) and began to set up the phone. The phone kept resetting itself or shutting down completely throughout the night. Again, I blamed it the amount of data I was transferring from my old phone. (mistaken again)I used the phone for a few days, and it reset or shut down probably an average of 5 times a day. Sometimes the phone would freeze completely and become unresponsive to any buttons, touching, or even my attempts to force it to shut down. I would just have to leave it alone for an hour or until it reset itself again.I ended up returning the phone, and asked to exchange it for one that worked. The company faied to do so and sent me a refund instead. Now I am without a phone right before the holidays and must scramble to find a new one. I will not be buying this phone ever again and I recommend that you don't either.
            "
"IPhone 8 Unlocked 64GB
            After two bad IPhone purchases on Ebay, both refunded, and no luck finding a decent IPhone 8 on Gazelle I was hesitant to order another pre-owned IPhone. However, this IPhone was as advertised. Mint condition, excellent battery life and yes, it was actually an unlocked  model 1863. Dropped in my MetroPCS sim card and was up and running immediately. Good purchase and would buy again.
            "
"Doesn't work with my AT&T Sim card
            I bought this phone with intention of switching my Sim card from my current phone, to this one since I already have AT&T. But when I when to get my Sim card switched at the store (since I also bought a case there as well) they told me it didn't work because the phone was locked. Very dissatisfied with my purchase.
            "
"Great
            Seller was prompt and the phone was flawless. After a couple months, I have had no issues.
            "
"Buyer Beware - Product not as represented
            When I received the phone it had a very thick screen protector, which I naively thought was an added benefit.  I removed the screen protector  a few days ago because of normal wear, and discovered at least 37 scratches on the phone-one that stretches almost from top to bottom of the screen, and another one that is very sizable, with many other scratches of varying sizes  This product was advertised as New - Refurbished.  It was not.  It appears to be a used phone with a lot of damage.  The screen is scratched to H*ll.  This is very disappointing and raises questions about the quality and condition of the phones being sold by this seller.  Don't get burned like I did.
            "
"Defective product received
            I received a defective phone. It arrived in good physical condition, but cannot be updated to the latest software version and no longer boots up. This is all within an hour of having receiving it.The return label I received from the seller requires that I pay for shipping!
            "
"The phone was clearly defective because the touch screen did not work.
            the phone was clearly defective. The touch screen did not work at all. This is extremely frustrating since I need a cell phone for work. This makes me question using Amazon when clearly defective products are shipped, apparently without assuring that the product is operational.
            "
"You can trust this purchase
            I was extremely skeptical about going with the certified refurbished option but this company did not let me down. You can trust this purchase completely and I’m so glad I did. It saved me hundreds of dollars and this phone works perfectly. I might as well as bought it new, no scratches or noise deformations. I’m pumped.
            "
"The phone works well maybe is a minimum problem
            After 3 months my keyboard doesn’t work well:((
            "
"Phone crashes a lot!
            The phone crashes all day at least 5 times a day and takes a long time to reboot. Looks fake.
            "
"Doesn’t work; waste of time
            Took hours to reach 20% charge; must be a defective while the front and back has no scratch the rounded corner has dents. The phone has been dropped, which most likely lead to the charging issue.In package only the phone is original, plug and cable are oem and no instruction. No lightening to earphone jack adaptor.Read some of the reviews and people had same issues; hope this return isn’t going to someone else?
            "
"Microphone issues during calls
            Half of my calls are muffled and people cannot hear me talking.
            "
"Is working good
            My husband is very happy with birthday present.
            "
"Disappointed
            The product came with a scratch and little divet on the screen. When I first got it, it had a screen protector on, so I thought the screen protector had the divet- nope.  After accidentally dropping it, my phone screen cracked right through the divet. I have not had this phone long and am pretty disappointed as It is not even usable now. Now the screen shows many lines of colors. I should have sent it back at the beginning when I saw the divet but was willing to work with it. Make sure you do your due diligence when you first buy it to send it back if there is any issues with the screen!It’s a true unlocked Apple phone. Worked with at&t and Verizon (we switched carriers).
            "
"Great service
            I bought the iPhone 8 256. It looked like new when I received it. It did not come in the original iPhone box. It came in a cardboard box with the plug in to charge it and the little metal piece for SIM card. It worked great in every aspect except that I noticed the sound quality was not as good as my iPhone 5s, the sound was more “tinny” sound, probably not noticeable to others, but it was for me. I don’t know if it was a defect or how the iPhone 8 was made. It just startled me when I would use it for an alarm clock playing music. I did not have any problem at all returning the iPhone. The package came with a card that had their phone number and email address, backed by Amazon. There is a 90 day warranty and I turned it back in shortly before the 90 days was up. When I spoke with the customer service, they were really nice and just wanted to know what was wrong with the iPhone. I was sent an email with the return label and I sent it back with no problem and got a full refund. Even though the phone did not work out for me, I would still recommend this company because of their great service and following through with what they say they will do.
            "
"Perfect
            I usually seek refurbished products as it is a good way to get quality devices at slightly lower costs than buying them new. I found this listing and I will admit that I was a little skeptical about making the purchase because of how few reviews there were. I contacted the seller and asked if there was any way that I could be assured that this would be a good purchase. They were very polite and gave me all of the info on the warranties provided by both them and Apple.I received the product and it was in MINT condition. The phone had absolutely no sign of ware whatsoever. It has been working perfectly for 4 months now, and I could not be happier with my purchase.The packaging clearly wasn't original and the charger was not OEM, but this is stated in the product description so I knew what I was getting into. No big deal.If you're the type of person that is willing to give up a fancy unboxing experience to save about $100, this is an excellent option for you.Additionally, I had no problems switching this phone over on my Verizon account. As long as you are a Verizon customer, this should be an easy process through the Verizon app.Thanks!
            "
"Defective. Not worth paying $380.
            Received a defective phone:1. The boot screen would display a line either above or below the Apple logo occasionally. It would either show as a green line or a static line2. There was occasional lag when swiping through home screens and opening apps. I compared it to a friends iPhone 8 and the problem was specific to the phone I received3. The touch screen would not respond occasionally4. The battery would not display correct percentages. I once had the phone charging for 20 minutes and the percentage did not increase at all. After restarting the phone it showed the correct percentage.  This also happened while using the phone — the percentage would not decrease until restarting the phone5. The speaker sound quality sounded poor compared to my friends iPhone 8
            "
"I could have never told you this wasn't a brand new phone
            I actually accidentally ordered this product when I meant to only add it to a wish list. I contacted the seller and they agreed to work with me to return it, but I decided to actually keep it, but kudos to the seller for being great! The phone was in perfect condition. It came on a recent but not the newest version of iOS so I had to update it before using it. No dents or scratches anywhere, battery health was at 100% when I checked it too. It does not come in original packaging or with Apple cables to charge it or to connect 3,5mm audio cables. It does come with a MFi (Made for iPhone) ac power brick and lightning connector cable and a sim eject tool to help you change sim cards.I just want to share some insight about GSM vs CDMA models. This is a GSM model phone, however I am a Verizon customer-- which is a CDMA network. GSM model iPhones have all the LTE bands that Verizon uses (I think Verizon's main  LTE band is 13 or 14 if you want to look up compatibility  yourself). So even with a Verizon sim card in this GSM only phone, I can still access all of Verizons 4g networks and have phone and text service, as well as LTE and voice over LTE. If I ever go out in the middle of nowhere I won't be able to make calls likely because I won't have access to Verizon's CDMA bands, but it's just as good as any CDMA model for most peoples uses, just don't expect to have cell service while camping or in some state/ national parks if you are a Verizon customer. 4g and LTE is rolled out very wide so you shouldn't have any issues.
            "
"Screen was scratched upon arrival.  Definitely not a refurbished phone.
            After paying a lot of money for a rush phone, I got it in and it has 2 large scratches on the screen.  I’m forced to keep it as I HAVE to have one for work so I paid for rush shipping and had to load all my stuff on it, but NOT worth this price with the scratched screen.
            "
"Basically Brand New
            I was looking for a reasonably priced iPhone 8 and happened to stumble upon this phone. I was skeptical at first because it was the cheapest I could find anywhere online, however, I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. The phone was advertised as a renewed phone that could vary on the degree of visual usage and battery health. Aside from one scratch on the back glass, the phone is flawless. The battery is also running at 100% capacity which was one of the most important categories for me when buying a new phone. I also checked the IMEI number and model number to find out more information. I was very happy to find that the phone was only 8 months old, and basically brand new with all original parts. This checked all the boxes and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. For any one that cares my order was fulfilled by CR Land, who has their orders fulfilled by amazon. You can feel safe knowing that if you have to return your item or have any issues you will be dealing with amazon directly. You will not be dealing with the store front who supplies the product which is a plus since amazons return process is relatively painless. I would definitely recommend this product to another person just make sure you watch the prices, they often change and you may miss out on a deal that is up to $40 less than what is usually offered.

"Stopped working out of nowhere
            The phone arrived a day before; looked brand new; and worked perfectly... For the first 2 days. In just 2 days the screen has went black and stopped working. The phone is still on as it had 80% charge and it is vibrating when I touch the home button, but the screen does not work. I am now turned off by the whole experience as the phone looked perfect and stopped working out of nowhere.

"Looks, feels and functions like a new iPhone!
            I needed to replace my old iPhone 5S because of the slow processor speed and not so great camera.  The iPhone 8 was priced right and I'm very happy with it.  The hardest part of the upgrade was getting the sim card tray to open on my old phone.  My previous phone was also a refurbished unit which worked flawlessly for nearly four years.  I've had the new phone for about a week now and there is a lot of new functionality that I have yet to use so it will keep me entertained for a while becoming familiar with them.

"Great price! Phone works. A little wear. Works with Ting!
            The phone came as described in awesome packaging (as in, not just a cardboard box). The phone works great, it's fast compared to my iPhone SE, and was nearly flawless cosmetically. It had the signs of good use with a couple of scuffs, but that was covered up by the case I purchased. Besides, cosmetics don't affect the performance of the phone.Something I was a little leery about was the description, so here's my experience: The phone I received was unlocked and works great with Ting. The description said unlocked, but some reviewers mentioned that they received a GSM phone, and I was looking for CDMA. I received a phone that was unlocked that worked on either carrier network. I purchased from BuySPRY. I hope they don't mind I mentioned them.It is my understanding and from my research that unlocked and fully unlocked are roughly the same as carrier unlocked and factory unlocked. However, if the description specifies a specific network like ""unlocked GSM,"" then the phone will only work on GSM networks. Make sure to do your research on the phones before purchasing and contact the seller with questions. That's what I did and it worked out to my benefit.

"Exceptionally satisfied
            Purchased for my mother and received a glass screen protector already on it. Phone works exceptionally well, and was relieved that it was so perfect. Just wish it came with headphones. But the buy was worth it vs buying from a retail phone store.

"Refurbished phone died after 5 months
            After only 5 months, the refurbished iPhone 8 has died. Two updates and two restores failed.  $599 down the drain.

"Exactly as described
            My phone was delivered in a timely manner and came in nice packaging. No scuffs or scratches on the screen or outside of the phone. I’m very content with the condition of this phone and it was easy to set up with the existing sim card I had in my old phone through Verizon! I will never buy a brand new phone from the store again! I do need to invest in a converter or some new headphones for the new port.

            This is the real thing. Phone works perfectly. It is AT&T locked as described, but not a problem if you have them as your carrier.

"Almost as good as a new one....
            I was impressed with the phone.  The battery lifespan on the phone when I got it says 90%.  Not bad at all!  No scratches, no dents, looked pretty much new.  Saved hundreds and now I have the phone I wanted with 256g to download anything under the sun which is why I replaced my old phone that only had 18gb.  My work would only allow us to get the 18g iPhone which really annoyed me but I understood why.  So I took it upon myself when the battery started going to get my own phone & just pay for it myself.  We use AT&T as a provider at my work, so all I needed to do was take out the SIM card from my old iPhone and put it in this 256g beast....I’m so happy I did.  So far so good.  I recommend this seller for sure. Great product! I will update this review down the line if I end up having any problems out of the ordinary.  Hope this review helps as I was very skeptical in buying used and saw some reviews that aided me in making this purchase.  Also, I purchased using my Amazon credit card which allows you to make 12 monthly payments around $30/month at 0% interest.  I can’t lose!!!  That’s the cost of 10 coffees at Starbucks a month.  I’ll enjoy my own brew for a year to offset the costs.  Okay, I’m done.  Now I just sound like a bag of hot air.
            "
"Great Phone!
            I've had this phone for a little over a month now and I love it! I was somewhat scared to buy a refurbished phone, but so far this phone is working wonderfully and arrived in nearly perfect condition. There was a teeny tiny little scratch on the side of the phone, but it is barely noticeable. I only noticed it because I was looking for imperfections when I received the phone. It is much cheaper than buying an apple certified refurbished phone and is probably the exact same quality. Unfortunately, the charger is not an apple product, but is working well so far. If you're looking for a quality new phone that is not ridiculously expensive, I would highly recommend purchasing this one!

"Apple 8 was like new.

"Flawless Condition and Working Perfectly
            I purchased this iphone 8 as a upgrade from my iphone 6 on a Verizon prepaid service. The phone was received in two days with Amazon Prime and it was excellent condition, I could not tell the difference between it and a new phone, there were not any scuffs or scratches on the phone at all and I received a space gray one. I was able to transfer all my information from my iphone 6 to the new iphone 8 with no problem but when I tranfered the Sim Card it would not function, therefore I contacted Verizon using ""My Verizon"" on my computer: they ask for my IMEI number and the Sim Card number and  had it working in less than a minute. I have checked most of the features like the Fingerprint Reader/Home Button, Flashlight, Speakers using Amazon Music, Camera including Video, Volume and Screen Brightness, Battery Health was at 100%,  Etc...all items I tested has functioned FLAWLESSLY. At the time of this review I have been using the new phone for 3 days without any problems and very pleased with the RENEWED iphone 8.  Just days eariler I had received an Pre Certified iphone 7 from Verizon Prepaid and it was giving me problems staying connected to the Verizon Network saying on screen ""NO SERVICE""  therefore I returned it and ordered this RENEWED iphone 8 and I am glad I did because it's so much faster than the iphone 7 and was in flawless condition compared to the iphone 7 I received from Verizon. Thanks for selling an item as it was decribed or if not better than it was decribed, I would reccomend this iphone 8 to anyone.

"BE CAREFUL, STOLEN IPHONE!
            The iPhone I purchased actually was a stolen - and therefore blacklisted - one. I guess it's a common practice for this vendor to sell stolen iPhones.Amazon Renewed should probably be more careful of the provenance of the iPhones and should not take part in large-scale phone traffics.
            "
"Can't tell the difference between refurbished and new
            Looked like brand new.  Manual not in box but since it is a refurbished, I didn't expect it and it's easy enough to download on the net.  Works like brand new.  The only thing I didn't realize was Apple changed the shade of gold.  Not too happy with Apple but very happy with the product over all.  A nice black case solved the new apple gold problem.  The best thing?  the price.

"Great product and value
            I purchased this for my wife. I was VERY hesitant to purchase refurbished especially when you see reviews of phones not working at all or where product details warn against using phone with any carrier other then ATT. We use cricket, which uses ATT towers. Happy to report, phone arrived fast, condition was excellent (no dings, scrapes, scratches, or any physical damage whatsoever). Packaging was a repack ( not original box) but was re-wrapped, included new cable and charge block, phone was nearly charged to full. Included a nice screen protector. Setup was simple as new, no issues with transfer. My wife has been using for 3 days now and loves it (so far). Will update after 30 days but so far, very pleased and glad We purchased.**UPDATE** 30 days in and still no issues. Very satisfied customer

"Solid phone.
            Pretty much like new. I was quite skeptical given its Amazon and one step removed from the Wild West but the device is just about like new. A strong battery, no scratches, everything functions well and it even came with a tempered glass screen protector. I’m very impressed with the Renewed program.
            "
"Definitely worth it! Pristine condition
            Exactly what I was hoping for. Great condition barely any scratches! Screen protector and case were included!!! What else could you ask for. I’d buy from this seller again.
            "
"I should've expected what I got
            I ordered 2 phones, and should have expected the worst since what I got wasn't all that. One phone has a bunch of mini screen scratches, a few deeper ones, and an extremely deep one that was unavoidable (photos attached just of this one phone). Along with that, the phone came with a few dents and scratches around the edges anyway (which was ok and what I expected). The other phone I got had very very very few screen scratches and the minimal amount of expected dents on the side. On top of that, the way the home buttons felt when you pressed them felt different between the two of them. Both phones turned on fine, sound worked and touch screens worked normal. However I didn't even bother setting them up since I was going to return them.Since this item is $150 less than a new iPhone 8, doesn't come with Apple charger or headphones, the price difference wasn't worth it in my opinion and I ended up returning both of the phones. I'm leaving two stars since one of the phones was in decent shape and since I expected to possibly return these phones anyway. Just expect the worst but low-key hope for the best because in my case with was pretty much night and day between the two phones.

"Not unlocked as advertised
            Bought it for my wife and she is pissed. This phone is not unlocked as it says in the description. Took it to the apple store and they were unable to do anything with it. They said it is probably a stolen phone that still has a balance with Tmobile. Will be returning for a refund.
            "
"Good so far!
            For those of you trying to suss out which seller is best through the aggregated reviews, I ordered my from Electro Wireless. The phone took about a week to ship out, but to be fair I ordered just before the Fourth of July and I can see how that would gum up the works. It arrived within a day of being shipped though, so that made up for it.The phone looks immaculate (no scratches or dents). So far I've had no issues (though it's only been 24 hours). I booted it up, put in my sim, placed calls, sent texts, changed display settings, tested the speakers with my music, etc....anything I could really think to test I did. The phone came with the tool to open the sim tray, a US plug, and charge cable (the plug and cable are not Apple products, which I expected, but since some reviews act surprised, I'll confirm for those of you who think that really matters).There are two minor downsides. The battery capacity is only at 89% right now. While that's still entirely useable, at 80% the battery is essentially dead/needs replaced. So I've only got 9% to use, though I'm not sure how long that will take me to run down so maybe that doesn't matter. The second downside is they also send a tempered glass screen protector, BUT, it's unfortunately the wrong size. Not sure if it's for the 8S or a newer iPhone, but it sure isn't for the regular old 8. I ordered a case anyway, so it's not really an issue for me.
            "
"Just like new except for the price
            So far I think I like Android phones better than iPhone, but this phone operates and looks like new. The iOS seems counter intuitive; maybe I'll grow to love it. What I do like is that it doesn't deplete its battery like an Android. Seems like a high quality phone, and not as pricey as new.After several months of use, I like the device very much. It does what it claims and doesn't seem to have a lot of stuff running in the background depleting the battery and causing overheating like Androids I've had. Still frustrated by the arcane lack of file management that forces everything through iTunes. Some files just don't get transferred to the phone. Not the fault of the phone; Apple Corp just won't allow convenient computer operations.

"Not sure
            This phone was terrible. Returned it and waiting for refund. The phone was glitching, calling people keyboard would just type randomly letters by the hundreds. Couldn’t open apps yet apps would open on their own. Very upset.

"Careful of the IMEI
            A word to the wise, have BREED check the IMEI of what they're sending you. IMEI's are specific to GSM or CDMA, and even if the phone is fully unlocked, if the IMEI doesn't match, it won't work. For example, Verizon and Sprint have compatible IMEI's, and AT&T and T Mobile are compatible.I got a phone, and the IMEI did not work with my network, which is how I learned about all of this.A word on BREED, though. They are very easy to talk to, and very helpful. I doubt you will have any trouble reaching someone who can help you get the right phone for your network. I returned my phone with no problems, and they were very understanding about the difficulty.

"They don't care about customer service
            Bought two iPhones from these guys. I'm barely past the warranty period and one of the iPhones consistently shuts off when it gets a little warm. We only noticed recently because the person I gifted the phone to didn't start using it until one month ago. It took a month to really notice the problem. I called and explained the situation to these guys, and they couldn't get me off the phone fast enough. Since we were out of warranty, they just said ""nope, no exceptions."" I understand that technically they don't have to work with us to solve the problem, but seriously, in this day and age, great companies who care about customer service will be reasonable and help find a solution. I'm even willing to pay a little for them to swap out phones, but they were completely dismissive and rude to me on the phone and 100% unwilling to help. I'd recommend taking your chances buying a phone with another company. If you ever run into any problem, these guys clearly have zero interest in doing the right thing. Very disappointing.

"Phone was blacklisted by previous carrier
            I purchased this phone and my carrier, Cricket blocked my use of data and messages unless on wifi. When we called to figure out why, they had stated that the phone was blacklisted by AT&T in January of 2019. Meaning, this phone was not meant to be sold to anyone. Very disappointed.

"No SIM card
            The phone was on time and great however, there was no SIM card included which was a huge hassle as my iPhone 6 card was not compatible. I spent about 3 hours on chat and driving to the sprint store to get this figured out but eventually got it working. All in all it’s a good phone though.

"New and good phone, but something unexpected and disappointing.
            The phone is almost new and I didn't find any obvious defects. But The charger and US cable are not original. They are good in quality but the seller didn't say. No headphone connector. The price decreased from 579.87 to 559.99 before I receive the package. Disappointed somehow.
            "
"Phone looked great, but was defective
            Phone arrived on time, and looked completely new.  Was easy to set up and worked exactly as expected.  After two weeks, if I was out and was carrying the phone in a bag it would begin to randomly execute functions.  Initially I thought I had been hacked, but I read on line that this probably means the screen installation is faulty.  Unfortunately this happened  while I was on vacation, so I ended up being without a cell phone during my trip whenever I was out of the house.  It also deleted all my music (which I was able to re load when I returned home).  It then took another week to call and obtain the postage paid label and buy a replacement phone once I returned home, so I was without a mobile phone for several weeks.  I have bought refurbished phones in the past without any problem.  I intend to try again to buy a refurbished phone as it is the phone I want, it did look perfect, the battery life seems good, and the price is very good.

"90 day return policy very good
            This was a beautiful phone and a very good price. Everything worked great on it, except, unfortunately, the sound. I could hear everything just fine, but people I called said I sounded like I had my head in a bucket. I ended up returning it, so it might seem strange that I am reviewing it, but just wanted to let buyers know that the 90 day return makes it easy to take a chance on a renewed phone. No questions asked, no tricky stipulations. Just make sure you keep all your original materials and stay within the 90 days. The next phone I bought seems to be perfect, other than it isn’t that cheerful red. I did subtract one star because I think it could have been more thoroughly checked out prior to sale.

            My iPhone was scheduled to be delivered the day after the long Labor Day weekend, but it actually arrived the Friday before, which was an unexpected surprise. There were no scratches at all on the body or screen of the phone, it looked to be in virtually perfect cosmetic shape. Once I got it running from my iCloud backup everything seemed to work exactly as expected, and now a week later still is functioning perfectly.  The camera takes excellent photos, the screen is slightly better than my iPhone 7 it replaced, and wireless charging seems to work perfectly- no excess heat, not overly slow. My only possible complaint with the phone is that it came in with a slightly lower battery health percentage than I was hoping for- 89%. I was hoping I'd get something in the low to mid 90's still for battery health, but I get a full day with moderate to heavy use so can't really complain about that.  All in all I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the phone or BuySpry

You have to sign for the package, so be home when it’s delivered or they won’t leave it. I’m using it now to write this, so I can tell you it works great. When I got it I just popped out the SIM card from my old phone, so I personally didn’t have to go to the phone store. Maybe you will have to go in, maybe not, I’m not sure. But my experience was great. Thanks!

"Works with Sprint, very happy
            Works and looks great. Was able to activate with Sprint. Always skeptical buying a phone online, but I’m very happy!

"Great option
            I received this unlocked iPhone 8 2 days ago.  Went to Verizon and was no problem to connect.  Phone is in great shape- super minor scratches.  Working great so far , I’ll have to check back in after more time passes. Hopefully no issues.

"Phone doesn't work unless I use Bluetooth
            I had people complain that they couldn't hear me when I called them, so I started using my Bluetooth headset and all was good.  Then I found I could use speaker phone mode but it didn't work well. Finally I took it to the Genius bar and it turned out the microphones on the bottom of the phone are dead.  Repair cost is $350, which is the cost of the phone.Needless to say I am not going to buy from this vendor again.
            "
"Easy to switch
            I’m a Verizon Prepaid customer and wanted to upgrade phones. I had a little trouble trying to use eBay, so I came to amazon and this was by far the best experience I had with ordering this phone. It came the next day after I ordered it and I only needed to put my SIM card from my iPhone 6 into the new iPhone 8 and it connected right to the network. I didn’t have to go in the store or call a number or anything. Wonderful phone upgrade. It’s much better than the old one. Would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade a Verizon prepaid phone.
            "
"I should've paid closer attention to detail
            I didn't pay attention and assumed that this was amazon refurbished so I didn't read the reviews. I have only been using the phone for a few hours because it took over 3 hours to charge the phone to 80%. when I check the battery maximum capacity it is at 80% not what I would expect from a ""refurbished"" phone.  I am also getting some weird behavior with the Bluetooth it has been dropping connection with my car off and on. I am going to keep checking thing out but may return it if things keep going this way.
            "
"Water damaged and corrosion inside.
            When I got the phone, I was disappointed, but not surprised by the 85% capacity battery inside. I expected I’d be taking it in to Apple for a battery replacement, anyway. But, when I took it to Apple, they couldn’t replace the battery. They showed me pictures, where there was standing water and corrosion inside. Needless to say, I was shocked. Not only did I have the phone in a waterproof case, I only had it for a few days, and NEVER had it near water. I immediately contacted Amazon, who contacted the seller. The seller asked if I’d submerged the phone. I couldn’t believe it. After a few days of emailing, they agreed to a refund. I asked for a different phone with a full capacity battery as compensation. I use the phone for work. I missed out on money. They said they couldn’t oblige that. But, they did refund me promptly after reviewing the water damaged phone.

"Buyer beware - shutter sound can’t be turned off!
            Everything about this product has been perfect. The quality was indistinguishable from new, it has functioned reliably and perfectly since I received it. This would have been an easy 5-star review except for one thing:This is a refur unit from Japan, which means that the camera shutter sound is hardwired in and cannot be muted, turned down, or turned off.That one little thing is enough to make this unit borderline unusable for me, as I primarily (used to!) use my phone camera for wildlife photography on hikes. Now a single exceptionally loud click sends every critter in the vicinity scurrying for cover.

"Excellent condition..but only worked for 2 months
            The phone came in excellent condition. Worked until I updated it and now I cannot use it with my cellular data. Apple quoted me $360 to fix it. I’m very disappointed in the short length of time the phone actually worked but it is not the sellers fault.
            "
"Came in fine condition.  Worked well until it died 6 weeks into ownership.
            This phone arrived and appeared as described--like new.  Easily accepted our carrier SIM and worked great....for 6 weeks.  Yesterday the phone suddenly died.  I reached out to amazon and they connected us with Apple.  They tried in vain for an hour to get it working again but couldn't.  Ultimately Amazon accepted it to return (it had the 90 renewed guarantee) and off it went by UPS today.We've had good luck with renewed items and this may have just been a fluke.  But we decided to buy a brand new Apple Xr phone instead.

            This iPhone was in great condition! All I did was turn off my old phone, switch SIM cards, turn the new phone on and bam! The iPhone did the rest- synced my iCloud, upgraded, let me set passwords.. within 20 minutes, my new phone was ready to use. The battery life is perfect. STRONGLY RECOMMEND.

"Love it!
            Don’t be discouraged if it comes in a Verizon box! I was and I have Metro PCS. Phone is unlocked and ready to use when you get it! Barely any wear on the phone and I only noticed a tiny scratch around my camera. That is is. The graphics are amazing, the sound quality is impeccable. Definitely recommend this phone! Only downside is no aux port! But still has the button unlike the IPhone X series!

"Good option
            Phone has average battery life and price was about average.  Phone was in good working order when received. However needed to replace screen recently. No visible damage was present but display stopped working. Not sure if there was warranty on this purchase but couldn't needed to have repaired quickly so I didn't have time to find out.
            "
"Honest opinion
            Hi guys, I got the phone, it was unlocked as advertised, no problem for my carrier and I am in Europe. The phone works good for me, I've had it for a couple of days, although the battery capacity is at 89%, it can hold up to 2, 2 and a half days with talking and surfing, no charging. It doesn't restart, as some comments here say, which was what I was worried about and really the value for money is great. Apart from a couple of dinges on the side, visually the phone was great, it even had a protector on. For the people complaining that the battery capacity is not at 100%, just go change it, it's like 20 bucks and don't forget this is not a brand new phone, so for a refurbished phone that I got I can say I am pleased.
            "
"Good condition, good battery life
            I was worried, but the phone arrived in excellent scratch free condition. The battery life is fine after using for a few weeks. Does not come with a SIM card.
            "
"Was skeptical but very satisfied with my purchase
            I ordered the fully unlocked version. When it came in the mail it was in new condition, no scratches or dings, and it came with the charger and tool to get my sim card out. We have a plan with Verizon, I was able to take out my sim from my old IPhone and put it in this one and it turned on and loaded all my stuff with zero issues. My phone is working fine and the battery life is just as good if not better than my last phone. So far no bugs or glitches. I'm very happy with my purchase. There were a lot of mixed reviews so I was skeptical on buying it but I'm glad I did! Plus it came with an amazon backed warranty so if one came defective I didn't feel like I would loose my money. My advice would be to pay close attention to your selection when adding the phone to your cart for service options and when in doubt go for the fully unlocked version.
            "
"Just as described
            Had no trouble at all in the setup and phone came with 100% battery health and no scratches or cosmetic damages. Some reviews say their phone was GSM only and did not work with their carrier. Be sure you check which phone you are getting because some did not say fully unlocked. I ordered the silver and all i did was switch my SIM card over and everything was there. Didn't even have to contact my carrier

"Great used phone, works on Verizon.
            Fantastic used iPhone 8, works on Verizon without any problems. I was skeptical. Highly recommended.

"Fantastic Quality!
            I got a nearly brand new phone! It is definitely 100% worth the upgrade from the 6s, nearly everything about the phone is better. It didn’t come with the headphones or a headphone jack adapter though, so make sure you get that too. This was an incredible deal being as the iPhone 8 goes for twice the price from apple.
            "
"It works.
            I upgraded from an iphone 6, to an iphone 8 after the announcement of the iphone 11 price drop, because with ios13 they finally stopped supporting the 6. All I do on my phone is check email, chat on telegram, take photos and watch youtube. I'm not a power user, so the main difference I noticed was everything became more responsive, faster, and the battery lasts much longer. The transfer process was pretty easy through itunes. No complaints, I stuck with apple out of sheer convenience, and I'll probably continue to stay with apple as long as they don't remove the fingerprint reader in future models.
            "
"Good but an issue
            Overall this product was very well working! No visible scratches on my phone and upon arrival the battery health was at 96%, however the shutter noise for the camera will not turn off leading me to believe that this product originated from another country.

"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER
            I have never left a bad review.  We own two businesses and I get the impact that reviews could have on a company.  It came with a charger and that charger is the only charger the phone worked on.  My 15 year old daughter saved ALL year for this $397 iphone 8.  It lasted 3.5 months.  We went on vacation and she forgot her charger.  By the way, it was still in warranty when we left for vacation.  Her phone would not work with any other iphone charger that we had.  I do not know much about the mechanical part of phones other than how to operate them. We went to a technician on vacation thinking it was the battery. Battery was fine, charge port was fine.  He said the chip was bad on the mother board and to fix it would be significant.  The technician said the seller KNEW this phone had a problem and sold it anyway.  Amazon contacted seller. Seller emailed me it's 2 weeks out of warranty go to a repair shop.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.  ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.
            "
"Awesome , MetroPCS Compatible
            Apple asks you to verify account login with the phone number you originally started your iCloud account with and unfortunately for me that was about 4 numbers ago so I couldn’t gain access to my old purchases or pictures. But the device does its job. You’ll definitely have to take a trip to your mobile carrier to get the SIM activated (coming from android phone) good purchase.

"Came in without any scratches and works perfectly fine.
            I was a bit hesitant with this purchase because of the mixed reviews but I ended up buying it . It came in just today and works perfectly fine. The phone came without any scratches and without any trouble connected with Cricket easily . I ordered the phone full unlocked and based on others reviews was a bit scared of getting it with another company or getting it not unlocked. The phone came in with a charger but no headphones. You'll have to use your own tool when it's time to remove the sim card. Overall for right now the phone works fine but will update the review if any problems come in the few days.

"Beware of Renewed Phones
            Was extremely happy with the phone out of the box.  No damage to it whatsoever. I live in Poland but bought it when back in the States for vacation.  Was acting weird with my Polish sim card in the US but chalked this up to the fact I was in a different country than my sim card.  Got back to Poland, and problems continued.  85% of the time I have no service (phone or internet), even though I have an unlimited plan.  Even when in a safe wifi area, I have no service.  Basically, I'm without a phone if I don't have wifi to use whatsapp or messenger.  Phone is useless.  Very disappointed.

            Received my iPhone within a few days of ordering it.  There is not a scratch or mark on it anywhere.  It presents as new.

Called Sprint to see if I could get the phone unlocked.  Again, in a matter of minutes they had that done.  So, now I have a perfect iPhone 8, unlocked and performing flawlessly on the Sprint system.  With it now being unlocked  I can transfer to any other CDMA carrier that I choose.  Battery capacity is 95% which is excellent.  Fingerprint reader works perfectly.  Just purchased another one of these for my wife.

Upon closer examination I saw what appeared to be a small crack or deep scratch on the screen so I removed the screen protector and verified there was a small crack along with multiple scratches. The lightening connector port was also dirty and had scratches. Ultimately, I did not feel it met the standard of being renewed and not worth the money spent.  I am in the process of returning the iPhone 8 and will find another vendor.

"Can't turn off camera shutter sound
            I purchased this phone from BuySPRY.  The phone works great, EXCEPT you cannot turn off the sound of the camera shutter.  It is a Japanese model.  In Japan, there is a law that phones must make a sound when taking a photo.  The sound does not play when taking a live photo, but in any app that uses the camera, it will make a sound when taking a still photo even if it is muted.  Quite annoying if you are trying to take a photo of something in a quiet room.

"Value for money
            After reading some of the reviews on the reseller BUYSPRY I was actually terrified of buying this phone. Probably one of the riskiest clicks I've had to do.However, the phone arrived neatly packaged, exactly as advertised, with cable & wall charger and it looked brand new. There were a few light scratches on the screen and on the glass behind but the type of scratches that are only visible under certain angles and with lots of light - Personally not a problem at all. At first glance, it looks absolutely spotless - like a new phone. Battery capacity/health (the you can check at settings) was at 97% which seems pretty good. Overall, so far ZERO complaints. Phone looks amazing & works just as good.
            "
"product totally unusable
            when we tried to activate this unit with Verizon, we found unit had been locked on find my iPhone and could not be gotten into.  had to be returned.

"Good purchase!
            I was skeptical if to purchase this phone after seeing some mixed reviews but I did and it was perfect! Works like brand new and came with a tempered glass on. I’ve had it for 3 months now with no complaints ! Great value for money.
            "
"Ok For the money
            It had scratches on the phone . But it was my daughters birthday present . Did not feel like returning it . The charging port and cable were not Apple. But I think it mentioned that . The phone was just inside the box . No wrapping whatsoever. Phone is good I guesS overall

"Buy through the sprint store never Amazon
            I got the phone and it looked great nothing is wrong with the phones software or anything but when I went to get it activated couldn't even activate, the guy showed me his screen and it said ""phone is not elegable on this network"", and when you checked the phone to see what the carrier would be it said it was sprint. Customer doesn't fuckkng exist so I'm just returning and getting my money back dont buy this!

"Received locked, malfunctioning phone
            Wholly unimpressed with Amazon's 'renewed' service.-- I bought a phone compatible with T-Mobile, but our sims wouldn't work. After an extended support call we found out the phone was locked to a carrier in Japan. It was suggested that I could call them to ask for the phone to be unlocked... yeah no thanks.-- Also: The phone just randomly shuts off. Mid-use, and the phone's screen is black and the button is unresponsive. Nice jo at 'renewing'.So whatever 'renewed' means to Amazon, it is not ""refurbished, functioning phone"". Returning it and shopping elsewhere.
            "
"decent deal overall
            Had about 3 or 4 deep noticeable scratches along the edges of the screen. Came with a screen protector to try to cover up the blemishes. Other than that, everything works great. It isn’t perfect. The fingerprint reader might freeze a few times, but nothing that makes me not like the phone. Came with a non branded charger which charges faster than the original apple charger. No headphones. Its decent. For the price, you can’t beat it.
            "
"Works like new
            It took me a while to actually write a review on this because I wanted to be sure about the battery life and use it for a while. I’m usually  skeptical about refurbished products because something is usually wrong with it. But this phone works like brand new. I’m glad I didn’t regret this .
            "
"Just perfect
            The renewed iPhone 8 arrived with no visible scratches, dents or blemishes.  The battery life is excellent and every button and feature is in perfect working condition.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  Now I have retroactive buyer's remorse:  I wish I had bought my *last* phone as an Amazon Renewed product.

"perfect
            Has been in use, I feel the appearance is 90% new, still good, the screen, the speed of operation, standby time is not bad, recommended to buy, or even guaranteed, if you can give a screen protector and protective cover, it is better

"Not worth it.
            It worked fine until a month ago when the speakers started going out on it. I could hear decently on speaker phone when calls were placed but now they’re not very loud at all and I have to hold the speaker to my ear. Couldn’t even last a year.

            I had a couple of other iPhones where I really noticed the battery either having a very short working life or actually swelling and pushing out the front face of the phone, I can safely say that I am happy not to have noticed if this phone's battery life is just ""good enough"" or actually ""great!""

"The camera & it overheats!
            People are right about the camera!!! Even when you try to silence the camera it still makes noise, even on apps like Snapchat, etc. Haven’t had any other problems so far tho...Update: I returned the phone. It overheats while on the charger if you’re using it at the same time and will keep powering off it untilIt cools off. Don’t waste your time.

"95% battery health
            Great value, however the battery performance is at 95% out of the box.  Also, no ear pods.  Otherwise, great value and no cosmetic or other defects with the phone.  Mine came with a tempered glass protector courtesy of the original owner.

            Could not get this phone to connect to the Verizon network.  Worked with Verizon Customer Service and Technical Support for over four hours with no success.

So happy I did this instead of get an X or anything new which right now is more than double. My particular refurbished unit came with an aftermarket (but still very fast) charger and cable.

"New phone acts like a 3 year old phone
            When I received the phone, the packaging looked like someone ran over it with a tank. I’ve had this phone for about 3 months and this phone has randomly shut off and kicks me off my WiFi more times than I can count. The phone also keeps telling me to get a data upgrade which I’ve never had happen to me before when I’ve bought an iPhone on Amazon. I was trying to save money by buying a phone here, but I was just severely disappointed with this brand new phone acting like I’ve had it for 3 years.
            "
"Works fine unless you need it to work on WiFi.
            Looked pretty and clean, worked on the cellular network just fine, but not at all to just barely on WiFi. Test your phones before reselling them.
            "
"Be careful !
            The quality was definitely not the same as getting one from my T-Mobile store. It was very cheap and fragile feeling compared to the one I have now. I never played with it. As soon as I opened it and felt the quality of just the structure of the phone I sent it back.

"Software not updated- couldn’t hear out of speaker
            I was very disappointed when getting this phone. First of all, it says it is up to date but it had a very outdated software according to the Apple store and I couldn’t hear out of the speaker so I had to talk to everyone on speaker. I ultimately traded in my phone at the Apple store for $220 trade in value and got a new 8 plus instead. It sucks because I paid $370 for the phone and had it for less than a min so I was out $150. Buyer beware I would not recommend buying from this supplier.

"Works Great!
            I’ve had this phone for about a month and so far it has worked perfectly fine. When I got it, i right away checked it’s imei to be sure it wasn’t blacklisted or something. I didn’t want to put my info or SIM card right away, but imei is clean, so it’s all good! It wasn’t damaged at all. It looks new! Battery lasts a long time. It was a good deal if I say so.

"Overall great for my first purchase
            At first It seemed sketchy. I was just looking for a new phone after owning an iPhone 6 for 2 years. I bought it and it came a day in early. First seeing it it was in good condition. The only thing that I didn’t like was It had these tiny scuffs but you could barley see it, also the battery health was 89% wanted something over 90%. Overall my phone has been just fine.

"Was impossible to silence the camera
            I returned this phone because it was impossible to turn off a very loud and obnoxious shutter sound for the camera, even when the rest of the phone was on silent or vibrate.  Apparently phones that were originally sold in Japan or Korea have camera noises that are impossible to disable.  It was too annoying to keep.

"Died in 3 hours

"Phone may be from Japan
            Phone arrived and it was everything I'd expect from an iPhone 8, with one critical exception: it was MQ862J/A. The main difference this makes on a day to day basis for anyone buying this is that the camera sound is hardwired on due to Japanese law. So, caveat emptor, you may be stuck with the annoying camera sound.

            Very nice phone and just about the same exact size as my iPhone 7.  I am not so sure I like the glass back and won't be charging wireless on it but I'm overall very happy with this phone.  I am not a big user as far as calls and texting goes but the device is very fast and looks great.

            It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a red iPhone! Why did I get a red one? Dunno. It's a fine phone, but it's redder than I wanted because-- why did I get a red one?

            The phone was in excellent condition, as described. The battery lasts nearly all day, even when browsing reddit or other sites. A huge step up from my previous phone and I am very thankful for that!

"Refurbished improperly
            Phone quit working 1month after warranty was up. I was told by buyspry they would not replace or repair. They told me to take phone to repair shop. Repair shop said phone had not be repaired right the first time and could not be fixed now.

            No problems what so ever. The battery life was at 98% which was way better than I had expected. I have had the phone for about two months and it works perfectly with AT&T.

"Not a reliable product
            Phone I received was scratched from the bottom surface and after a month of use abruptly died on me, after several diagnostics at the apple store, we found it had nothing to do with the battery but device was having a circuit board issue.

"Crapple
            It’s a good phone when it works...like another user said it worked for about 3 months or so and then completely bugged out. It has this fun little thing it does where it powers off and restarts 50 times sometimes for 4+ hours on end. It freezes randomly. Audio becomes staticky and then completely cuts out on internet, music player, and during phone calls. Apple recommend restarting your phone when this happens and then that’s when the super fun restart-shutoff cycle starts for hours on end. Overall I’m completely disappointed and will never be using another Apple product ever again. This was Apple’s second chance from me after having side button issues with my iPhone 5. Never again!
            "
"Best Apple Product
            I have been an Apple consumer for about 4 years now. My first mobile device was the iPhone 6, and a few years later I purchased the iPhone 8, which was perfect because of its great size, amazing durability, great battery life, and decent price point.  When the iPhone 8 first released, the price point was fairly high at $699. Although a little on the expensive side, it was definitely worth the money. Since my family knew the phone released just a few weeks ago at the time, we had an idea that it would last me at least a couple of years. We were right.I use my phone a lot. Being a teenager, I spend a lot of my time during the day on my phone, watching Youtube or spending time on social media. I am also very clumsy, so I drop my phone quite a lot. Considering the phone has been used constantly for 2 years, it’s still in perfect condition with no scratches or dents. The camera quality is still great, the audio is amazing, and the phone works just like new.I recently upgraded to an iPhone 11 not because the iPhone 8 was wearing out, I just thought it was time to upgrade. People might say that it’s not worth it to purchase the 8 anymore because it’s an older model, but I believe that if you are purchasing a first phone for your child, this would be a great starting point for them. The phone has all the necessary features, plus the price is much cheaper than before because the model is older.  Overall, the iPhone 8 is one of my favorite Apple products. Even though I recently upgraded to an 11, I still believe the phone is amazing, considering it’s in great condition after constant 2 year usage. I would highly recommend purchasing this phone if you are looking for something on the cheaper side with great features. The iPhone 8 might not be the iPhone 11, but it’s still one of the best phones on the market in my opinion.

"Garbage
            What garbage. Why do people rave about Apple products? I'm going back to an Android.
            "
"Good But Very Expensive for Ordinary Americans
            I have been using iPhone 8 for 2-1/2 years.  It is a good phone with all my needs.  It does feel heavy in my hands.  Battery life lasts 8 hours with moderate use. I would recommend iPhone 8 to be the best and most versatile iPhone. As for the price tag, it is sooooo expensive at $700.  I cannot afford a $600 phone every year.  So I stopped at iPhone 8 and do not plan to upgrade as it is just way too expensive for me.  Having said this, I bought my phone 2.5 years ago and intend to use the same model for the next 3 years.  So lets hope this phone will last that long. Fingers crossed.
            "
"Apple Products are a Waste of Money Now
            I bought a BRAND NEW iPhone 8 from a Verizon Wireless store about 9 months ago. THE BATTERY IS ALREADY STARTING TO FAIL. I used to be able to have about 2-3 quality days of charge with moderate use. I am now down to about 1 day. This is the epitome of planned obsolescence. I did not leave it in a super hot car or get water on it. It is just straight up losing power much faster. Apple is delusional if they think they can get away with this.At this point, even though I have not even finished paying the phone off, I am writing it off as a loss and moving to Android or similar device the next chance I get. I would suggest you do the same.

"The best phone
            Great reception indoors, on the road (Bluetooth connected), and anywhere else.  AT&T is the best for the money coupled with this Silver iphone 8...Just the right size, easy to grip, hold on to, and accessible.  The silver phone is easy to find when you put it down somewhere, or it gets buried and have to call the phone (if I don't keep it on vibrate).  All in all (with the help of youtube) anyone can learn to use any feature or APP with this phone.  The best.

I was scared there would be a scratch on the iPhone , but I was wrong. And I am so happy it’s pretty much a new phone from Apple. It’s that good!!! The box was great with the charger and the iPhone. I would have wished that there would be headphones included but it’s fine by me.It’s a great use of your money , it seriously is.

It was just in a baggy, not even secure and has several small scratches on the screen.I am still happy with the purchase but I don't like to be lied into thinking I was getting what should have been a ""like-new"" product.
            "
"Defective
            iphone came with a scratched up screen. Even renewed I didn't expect too receive a scratched up iPhone. Would replace the screen but I would probably  end up just making things worse. I have a lot of  technical knowledge when it comes to smart phones  but my technical skills are mediocre at best. This does make it Hard to view anything on the screen. Battery life is is okay. I  get around 4.75 or more hours  out of 1 full charge. The iPhone  got's wireless QI charging which charges the phone just as fast as plugged in. can't use the phone while charing wirelessly though like you an when charging plugged in from a lightning cable. Color and resolution is fantastic. Most of the video I watch on the iPhone is 1080p HD. Power button is on the side rather than the top. Which takes some getting used too because I am upgrading from an iPhone Se. Personally I'd rather have it on the top. I have got some some phantom, random, etc.. whatever you call it, turn ons and offs. The iPhone does not turn on right away like my iPhone se did. I have to hold down the power button for like 1-2 minutes before it turns on. There might be something internally wrong with the iPhone. I am not sure. It should turn on right away. The iPhone is 5.45"". That is larger than I am used too coming from the iPhone SE. Much like the power button that takes some getting used too but  having a slightly larger screen is nice  when watching youtube videos. Nevertheless, because of  defects  i.e. scratches on the screen, iPhone turning on so slow, etc.. I had to give this a 1 star.

It was our fault for letting it fall, I guess, but I did not realize the glass replacement would be with something cheap and fragile.

Took it to Apple who diagnosed a complete logic board failure. Apple would have at least been sympathetic to the 90/92 days... not so with BuySPRY. So now I have an expensive brick.

"Works great for me - Verizon in LA
            I've heard mixed reviews from Verizon on these refurbished phones and especially in Los Angeles, where Verizon seems to be the only one with the least amount of dead zones- I was unwilling to switch carriers. This has worked great. No reception problems - I only had one issue with it connecting via Bluetooth with my car but it worked out after I took it to the apple store. Note- this did not come with a pin for the sim card so I had to use a safety pin.
            "
"Read the fine print match your carrier closely
            It was hard to get my carrier to turn on my phone completely. Consumer Cellular just kept saying “ we don’t guarantee that these phones are compatible with our system”. They specifically did not turn on the universal setting. I lost work time and money and could not get my mail for a week. Suggestions when purchasing look at the fine line and make sure your carrier tak s the phone. Ultimately Consumer Cellular (at&t and T-Mobile lines) we’re trying to get me to purchase their own phone. One week later went to Apple Store and about two hours later my phone was operational. CompletelyI do want to purchase the insurance before the 60day warranty ends.

"Phone works, not that refreshed
            Battery life was 90 percent when I got the ‘refreshed’ phone, would have liked that to be 100 percent as the battery is an easier replacement.Phone had a noticeable dent/scratch on the bottom right which doesn’t look great but goofily is just cosmetic, although I wouldn’t be surprised it it affected the water proofing as the mark has to be caused from a fallLastly I think I was sold a phone from Japan because I am unable to take photos silently, which means I wake up my cat every time I try to get cute pictures of him sleeping. Nothing I have tried has allowed the phone to silently take pictures

            Fantastic camera! Terrific pictures I can take with this!  I have had no problems buying from the seller any of the phones I’ve purchased from them. I even returned one that was not compatible and got a complete refund
            "
"Happy, not ecstatic, about entering the iPhone club
            Coming from and Android Moto e4 plus, the slightly higher level of intuitiveness, the integration into a peripheral ecosystem, and the ability to more easily videochat by far outweigh the lower battery life. I can still get through a day on one charge and the difference between 1 and 1.99 days on a charge is meaningless if i have to charge either phone daily because one wouldn't last a full 2 days.
            "
"QA not very good
            I bought this as an upgrade for my iPhone 5s. I had problems with the phone from day one, but since I had brought it back with me to Peru, it was $50-70 to return the phone. I decided to hold onto it and try it out longer. The phone started working again for a few weeks and then stopped working. Then, after a reset, it worked again perfect for a few more weeks. Now the phone won't stay on for more than several minutes and I'm back to using my iPhone 5 and past the warranty. I should have returned it but that ship has sailed. They don't seem to be checking these phones very well in my opinion, you are better off buying a refurbished phone from Apple which is slightly more expensive but offers better support and a longer more reliable warrenty.

"3 months and already needs repair.
            3 months in aand already not working. My husband is currently at Apple getting it repaired for $149.  So now a refurbished iPhone 8 is costing $650 plus all the time that we are putting into this.
            "
"Looked great when I got it . is a durable model. Insides feel unsecured ....from its arrival .
            When the phone is moved back and forth in hand the “ insides” feel like they shift..is that normal for this model? Everything seems to work as expected tho, and I  say it is VERY DURABLE. i DROPPED IT getting out of the car, onto concrete ( before I bought a protective case) and it did not show a mark.I’m at a loss to understand how my granddaughters repeatedly break the screens on their iPhones.Please tell me if I will be able to use this phone with a norwegian cell service SIM card.

"Worth the money
            Looks brand new! Not a scratch.  Works good.  The keyboard doesn’t always come up once in awhile but I wonder if that has to do with possible slow WiFi or cell service?  But I know practically nothing about technical stuff like that.  I was so afraid to spend the few hundred dollars and get a piece of crap that I’d have to send back.  I’m glad I finally took the leap since my old iPhone SE was cracked and was starting not to respond to touch screen

"Arrived defective
            I was hoping that a certified refurbished iPhone would be fully functional when I received it. The earpiece in the iPhone was not functioning and battery service life was within of 10% of needing replaced.  The aesthetic condition of the phone was good...just couldn’t hear the caller. Returned it.
            "
"No complaints
            Switched from Droid to apple earlier this year so my friends would quit mocking me. The refur I ordered was almost brand new not even a scratch. Everything works great AND I checked the ""battery life"" through the settings and it was at 100% . Would definitely recommend!

"Apparently wasn't inspected intensely
            The unit looked mostly new with mild scratches on the back panel.Everything worked sort except for one thing; the screen would during use intermittently go from idle to off to active mode in a cyclical pattern. I return.

"It’s used, you get what you pay for!
            I bought the silver iPhone 8 used here through Amazon, and everything works great on the phone. I haven’t had any issues using my carrier, sound playing, or otherwise. Works as intended which is the important part.However, the back screen was clearly replaced and done so with little care. There’s a  lip on one side, so the glass back isn’t flush like it should be. Not pivotal to the function of the phone itself, but still annoying.

Highly recommend this product and seller. Thank you again.

"Just what I was looking for
            Needed to upgrade from 6 but didn’t need the newest iPhone. Love not being locked into the contract longer. Was able to take my Verizon card out of the old one and put it right in the 8, no activation fee like I would’ve paid in store. Battery lasts way longer than the old phone. Will come back to repurchase a refurbished phone over a new one when needed

"decided to return it immediately
            After seen black all over inside the charge port, I immediately decided to return it. It looks brand new from outside, but the inside might be miserable. If electronic connection once has problem, the phone won't function well. For this reason, I don't have confident to keep it even for 3 months.  Already returned it.

"Just what the doctor ordered
            iPhone 8 is an upgrade from my iPhone 6s.  Such a nice phone I'd swear it was new.  Great battery life and with the help of my 12-year-old grandson the migration from my old to the new phone was a breeze.  Works well with My Ford Sync and Apple watch.  Highly recommend

            There are two models of iPhones, a GSM-only and a GSM/CDMA.  Only CDMA phones are compatible with Sprint, but this phone is a model A1905, which is GSM-only.  Therefore, it's not Sprint-compatible, contrary to what the description.

"Great value for the money.
            This phone is ~40% less that a comparable phone at A. T. & T.  Getting it set up with my carrier was as simple as moving the SIM card from my old phone to this phone.  Once there, all I had to do was get the software upgraded to the latest version of IOS and restore from backup.  It has worked flawlessly since.

"Good for the money 🤞🏻
            Three weeks in and it’s pretty good.The battery holds a good charge and the touchscreen is responsive.It is a Japanese model; so you can’t silence the camera sound. I don’t need to take pictures secretly; do you?

"Versatile and sleek!!!
            It did not came as gold as I would want. Also, battery life is not as good as BlackBerry KeyOne, but is faster in processing, does not freeze on multitasking and you can sync everything (or almost everything) from another Apple iPhone or iPad.

"Stop paying for the same phone since the the six, save your money.
            I have never been more disappointed with a purchase in my life. Besides the battery being terrible, the phone worked great, for about three months. After that, forget it, freezes randomly, if you need to use it for direction, carry a compass, this thing has terrible gps. I work downtown, so I'm use to some issues, but it's so bad I need to find a clear area that I know is fine. That would be ok if it wasn't four blocks away from my office. Don't buy iphones for the price they want, this is 400$ phone tops. Demand more from a company instead of buying the next thing that apple makes, they haven't made improvements since the six and this is just the 6 version 4.

"What model are you buying..heres help a fully unlocked a1863
            e Unlocked iPhone 8 comes in two models for US carriers: A1863 and A1905. There is also model A1906, but it is intended for Japanese carriers so isn’t considered for this article.This post is part of our Unlocked iPhone Buyers Guide meant to answer all your questions about buying an unlocked iPhone.This article will help answer the question: Which unlocked iPhone 8 should I buy for my carrier network? We’ll discuss the model differences, carrier compatibility, and help you choose the right iPhone 8 for Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint or your favorite MVNO.Unlocked iPhone 8: A1863 vs A1905The A1863 is the GSM+CDMA model and works on pretty much any carrier, including Verizon and Sprint. The A1905 is the GSM-only version, sold as the carrier model for AT&T and T-Mobile, and won’t work fully with CDMA networks.A1863 A1905VerizonSprintTingUS CellularAT&TT-MobileCricketInternationalA1863 models have CDMA support which Verizon and Sprint use for 2G and 3G connectivity. The A1905 will not support Verizon’s or Sprint’s CDMA networks, so if you want a phone that works on all four carriers, you need to get the A1863 model.

"ALL I CAN SAY IS DON'T BUY ONE!!! THIS GOES FOR ALL iPhone's
            I've owned 2 iPhone's for the last 10 years. They have great customer service but my last iPhone SE I bought 2 years ago has a  screen that is failing. Here's the problem, it's out of warranty, everyone I talk to says because of Apples updates this phone isn't worth repairing and the only iPhone I should be considering is the iPhone XR or above. So that's $400 down the drain and at least $750 for a phone that's already on it's way heading down the drawn. Apple is way to greedy, just look at it's stock. It doesn't reinvest  or offer less expensive smaller phones. That means that their way to greedy! I just bought a Moto g7 Power for $250 with 2x  the battery life of most phones and the same basic features as the iPhone's. Another problem is that Apple notes is un-compatible with any other platform. So that means if you have a lot of notes on your phone or iCloud you can't move them to Google easily or anything else. THE BOTTOM LINE IS STICK TO ANDROID BASED PHONES AND YOU WON'T HAVE THESE PROBLEMS!!!

"Strongly advise against...
            Apple itself has bad programming annoying promps for passwords that leave you going in circles. Their password recovery process is a joke and takes 2 weeks. They cant remotely access your device and unlock it for you like the other big tech companies. I bought this phone after owning an iPhone and ipad before i sold them out of frustration of not being able to use free ringtones alarms and tones (as apple makes you pay for all these services wich are free on android) also they sent me updates to slow my phone down after the first year or so... after purchasing I realized that someone had gotten into my account and changed my passwords... now I have multiple ways I can verify ownership... I have access to the email the phone number everything on the account they could easily send me a verification text or email that only I can verify as I'm connected to the phone number and the thief doesnt have access to the email... no excuse why I should have to wait 24 hour then another 14 days... as Microsoft or samsung can unlock your device instantly after verification... you cannot call this extra Security measures either because obviously someone is on my account and will remain spending my balances and things for another 14 days and also any government agency can access your phone though them now they changed there policies... for theses reasons I strongly advise against apple and apple products. Also not as custamisable with widgets and things as android

"lose text messages! extremely fragile! Poor Apple support
            Bought a brand new iphone8. Start to not receiving group text messages. Also text messages would be resent every few weeks. Worked with apple support, went to apple stores, spent hours and hours trying to get this resolved and no luck!The worst of all, Apple refuse to admit their software, OS had serious problems. Refuse to provide refund.The hardware is also very fragile. Yesterday, with full armer protection. phone screen still cracked after dropping on CARPET!.Stay away from iphone if you can! the quality and support is very poor.
            "
"Almost indistinguishable from new .. .
            I have no idea how units may vary. Mine had no scratches at all. It had a screen protector glass installed. Perfectly aligned, no bubbles.  Visually it looks 100% new. The battery is at 93% of the capacity of a brand new battery. It came with the tool to get the SIM out. The charger isn't the original Apple charger, but it's just fine.  The phone comes with a warranty and instructions for a free return if you don't like it.

"iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 11. 4. 1 ...
            iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 11.4.1We have a new iphone 8+ and purchased the wireless charging so we can use our wired headphone while wireless charging.  Yet when we put the iphone on  the charging pad the phone automatically switches to speaker phone.  I then have to reconnect my headphones  in order to use the wired headphone.  I am using the apple factory firewire connecter for my headphones.Quick update.  Apple support had me remove all network settings.  Which offered no help.  We replaced our apple firewall to 3.5mm, with no help.  However, the issue is very repeatable that is until apple is on the call with you  So scenario:  1) plug in your headphones via the apple firewire to 3.5mm cable  2) place your i8 on the belkin charge.  The i8 will switch to speaker phone automagically.  In order to use your headphones you must reconnect your headphones ( ie connected to the apple firewire to 3.5mm cable)  One more tidbit...  It appears that when the i8 wirelessly charges it gets a bit warm.  Maybe, the firewire port or firewire cable, has issues with the temp change which causes the firewire connection to tell the OS to switch from headset to speaker?  We called apple support and the rep could see my i8 screen and of course we couldnt repeat the switch from headphones to speaker on the i8.  Rep said it was the headphones, which I discussed w/ him that is not the case.  However, I now have a brand new pair of Sony Noise Canceling headphones, are Sony and Apple working together to sell more gear?  Anyway, first thing this am I plugged in the new Sony wired headset via the Apple cable and voila when i place my i8 on the wireless charger the I8 switched to speaker.  A bit comical really... So I guess its an OS bug ?

            The screen is pretty unresponsive around the edges. It builds temperature and freezes frequently. And now the battery throttling makes it unresponsive. My last iPhone.
