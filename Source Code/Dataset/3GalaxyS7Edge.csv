Window view work. The phone doesn't even have the option...
Works great and looks even better. Got here very fast. Did have a little trouble when it was first opened trying to get it to English and not Chinese. Great choice from many different models.
just found out there is a recall on this phone. bought it as a present and have not opened it yet. trying to find out where to return
Its great and beautiful. FYI the origin seal region is Arab Emirates and it cannot use Samsung pay.
I received the item with Broken seal.
"An excellent phone in every way possible, feels very sturdy and premium when held in your hand."
Very sharp picture and display. The edge makes the picture looks 3D. The slippery glass face does not give me any problem about finger smudge as some people said on internet. However because the glass is slippery so you better get a protective cover not only to protect it but also prevent it from slipping out of your hand.
"Can't put a screen protector on it. Dropped it and it shattered. Now it is useless. Do not buy. I had the screen replaced, 1 month later, a pink vertical line appeared for a day, now the screen is black and won't do anything. DO NOT BUY!!!"
I got tons of compliments over this phone. They kept asking me where on earth and how did I got a pink phone. So far I'm loving it. Thank you
Love it!! No one has the coral so when I took it to AT&T to get my phone set up the were shocked I had it!! It's worth getting it syncs right up with my hearing aids just fine and with my car perfectly and it doesn't stay locked once it connects with your car so u are completely hands free!! Love the fact the rain will not ruin my phone since I work a lot outside!!
"Perfect, exactly as described and without any issues."
"This phone is giving me problems despite being two months in use! Unfortunately I experienced problems with it when the return date has elapsedFacebook App is not working, I tried to reload it so many times but in vainSometimes it switches its self offAnd the battery life is also not good"
"The phone was working just fine for a few months other then the battery draining extremely fast until recently. The s7 edge had a green line that went across the top of the screen and started flashing white while I was using the phone. It later progressed so that the screen would turn white and you whould no longer able to see what was happening on the display. Keep in mind that the phones screen is still in one piece and the touch sensors where still working.I called Samsung technical support and they said that they do not support the international model and for me to contact the country that it was made in, Vietnam. I then messaged Vietnam Technical support and they say they do not support products from the US.If I had known that by buying an international phone, I wouldn't have a warranty through Samsung, I would not have bought this phone, its a waste of money.Seller: Open Group Wireless"
I started to see a bright pink line of the screen which wouldn't disappear. I have been maintaining the product with no impact. Shame!
Very Good phone
this is an amazing phone. best i have ever owned.
"Good buy.Months now.The retailer is too good and had a prompt follow up.The only one issue still haunting me is the charging time,it takes 2-3 hrs to charge from 0-50%.The retailer even send me a new charger free ,which didn't help me.i bought a wireless Samsung charger too ,but in vain.Otherwise the product runs smooth and fast.No hang,hiccups, by Gods grace still going smooth.Thanks for the retailer. All the best for him."
great product
"great camera, great battery life, best screen ive seen.great phone overall"
excelente
"I was immediately dissatisfied with my Galaxy S7 out of the box. The famous fast charger included is only for 'type G' outlets...the kind used in Malta, Cypress, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and parts of the UK with 3 plastic rectangular blades. It's useless to anyone in Europe or the US. And there is no US adapter included that will allow for fast charging. I'm using my old USB type c charger which takes about 4 hours for a full charge!!!Upon setup, I immediately realized that the wifi calling feature was disabled. After doing some research, I learned (from online android blogs, so keep the source in mind) that my phone is an Arab Emerites (UAE) version for which WiFi calling is unavailable, unlike other international versions sold in the UK and China. That will be a HUGE cost for me when traveling internationally.Finally, I'm only on my 3rd charge, but the battery life is nowhere near advertised. I had a 100% charge at 7:30am, and at 10am my battery is down to 66%. It will not go a whole day with moderate/heavy use. This is NOT the 2 day battery S7 sold in the USA....buyer beware."
Excelente
Product was received as advertised. Very pleased with delivery time.
"It's wonderful, exactly what I needed"
muy buen producto
Works very well in Africa - Unlocked
"My phone dead, don't know why? Can't not turn on at all"
every thing went fine according to expectation.
"best phone i had so far, love it"
"Very good telephone with lots of features. I have the dual sim card, and it operates nicely... pictures are great.Only drawback, the dual sim uses the same space for the dual sim and for the memory expansion slot."
Love it.
BEWARE OF BUYINNG FROM AMAZON!THE PRODUCT IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY IN U.S
"Been using it overseas, one US and one foreign prepay sim. Work great, in fact, I don't know why every phone is not like this. I see a lot of trades people with two phones, this is the answer people. When a call or text came in, it tells you through which sim, when you make a call or send a text, you can choose which sim if sends it over. The kicker is that the dual sim is cheapest than the locked single sim. .. the only down side, is that Samsung pay will not work unless you do some surgery, not an issue, I user android pay and that works fine."
"Its a great phone, at first i was a little suspicious about this factory unlocked phone, but it turned out great!! dual SIM, easy to configure and overall great! its the best android phone out there so i highly recommended. it comes with everything listed and i checked the IMEI on the phone and the box and it matches. It does however come with the Europe charger but since i had the wireless charger from my S5 that wasnt an issue."
"It works very nicely, I had my concerns at first. And because of that it took me almost 3 months to decide on which option I should take."
It's nice
ok
what can i say??? greatest smartphone in market rigth now... cant complain on anything... it wonderful!
"After 5 month since I bought mobil phone, is gettting hot and have monitor problems"
Expected one Sims card received phone with two .What should I do now?
"Got this phone for 5 days, like it a lot. run smoothly, good looking, battery is good, as long as you know how to set your phone"
Very good
I was surprised that the unit could only either take 1 sim card and one memory card or two sim cards. Really have to read the fine print these days to know what you're getting. :/
It's so good
Excelente celular. El dual sim me funciona perfecto. Totalmente recomendable
Totally satisfied with this purchase
The phone didnt start .
"I purchased this phone to replace my malfunctioning HTC One M7. At first glance I have to say the screen is gorgeous. I have watched youtube videos and other short clips and was amazed at the crisp color and motion. When taking photos, the pictures were nice. When I zoomed in on the phone I did start to notice some minor pixelation so I will most likely stick to my Sony DSLR if I really what to take distant shots. I have a few games that I play and the controls are seamless and react with un-noticeable delays. I have used the fingerprint login for my phone and other apps but I cant get it to consistently work. Calls are clear and I like the volume boost option although it is disabled for my bluetooth headphones. The battery life is fair with the phone running for a full day with wifi, bluetooth, location and mobile data each being on. There is also a battery save mode that will cause the phone to become grayscale and limit which apps can be open while preserving messaging and calling. That is a huge battery boost. Overall, I am highly impressed with this product and I am hopeful that it will last for many year to come."
"I was thinking to buy the best smartphone out there but the touch screen is not very responsive, the touch screen randomly doesn't react without pressing the screen which make me feel that the phone is very laggy.It seems that it is a common issue.:("
"I dislike that I was deceived thinking that I was purchasing a ""NEW"" phone. Item used and repackaged To be sold as ""NEW""."
Just excellent
"The screen broke and began showing stripes after a month (hardware defect). Possibly related, the battery also needs to be recharged 2-3 times a day with moderate usage (no video or downloads, background apps closed). Judging by the other reviews, this retailer is fine with selling faulty and fraudulent products. Do NOT buy from this retailer."
Awesome phone
"I was a bit dubious after reading a few of the negative reviews but found the phone which arrived to be in a sealed box and exactly as described on Amazon. I purchased from BREED and I am very happy with my new Samsung Galaxy S7 dual sim phone. The only downside was that it was a phone sourced from the United Arab Emirates which in itself is fine but the charger was for a UK type outlet, easily fixed with a US plug adapter."
great phone great service
FINE
All was excelent
Dood jop
"This phone is awesome never had a better phone battery life is absolutely amazing and don't worry this is NOT A FAKE I checked it and my box came brand new, new seal not broken like some people say but the only downside is it comes with a UK charger it's no big deal they include a U.S adapter with the package and my fast charging works just great so no need to go out and buy another charger just make sure u get a good case I have the speck candy shell I recommend it and I have no edge touch issues with a case on"
"I've had this for about 4 months now. I totally love how sleek it feels. Really premium piece of machine. But you need a good case, it feels that fragile. I've had a Samsung phone for over 4 years so using this was no difficult task. Nothing too surprising. There are things I don't use much though....such as the edge screen. Though the night clock really works well for me. It does seem to be waterproof but I will not willingly test that. But I notice I can still use the interface with droplets on the screen. This was not the case with my previous phone. It is still fairly new so the speed is great. Battery life is awesome. I can confidently leave home without the charger for an entire day of heavy use. No overheating. Overall, good purchase. I would buy it again but I have no intention of losing or destroying it and I don't plan on splurging on another upgrade for the next 2-3years. I hung onto my S4 for that long."
"Very good experience with this phone but it came with a cosmetic damage located at the back near the camera, looking like a small paint stain underneath the glass. Which doesn't really mather as it's in a case all the time."
Excelente
"Beautiful device, smooth operation but battery life is a huge disappointment. 3 hours max before recharge needed with heavy use"
AFTER A MONTH OF USAGE THE SCREEN HAS BLURY BLACK LINES WHEN I CHANGE THE LIGHT TO LOW.
"Not as described - it is not equipment with ""Dual-core 2.15 GHz Kryo & dual-core 1.6 GHz Kryo"" (Snapdragon 820). This is the international version that is using a different CPU."
Amazing phone as I'm sure your aware. Taking off a star for its only problem which is the edges can be very annoying when you are holding it and it registers a touch at the side. This is its biggest problem that many people complain about. Possibly a deal breaking issue I would probably go with the s7 tbh if I was buying again. In terms of the international thing it's no big deal exactly the same except it comes with a foreign plug and they include an adapter which is nice. Everything was in English and phone setup went flawlessly. The Asia version is dual sim compatible which is the only difference from the EU version as far as I can tell and find online. So go for that one. Keep in mind it will only work on GSM carriers such as tmobile and at&the and nothe with CDMA like Verizon
Very good
The edge is a terrible design unless you hold your phone in the palm of your hand and never touch the sides.
"I received a fake phone. It doesn't even have a spot for the Sim Card, neither does it charges or turns on. Some S7 details are literally drawn on the plastic. It's just a piece of plastic on a Galaxy S7 shape."
Just as specified....excellent
liked it
"Excellent product. Work on all gsm networks around the world. In USA works great with AT&T and T-Mobile. My comes with UK ac adapter, if you want to use at another countries you need to buy an appropriate Ac adapter."
Excelent!! The box was sealed really new in perfect condition. Congratulation!!
"Outstanding phone. Great features and the curved edge is great. Haven't had issues with this beauty. Most complaints I do not understand, unless they have personal problems. I've attached photo of the adapter that comes with it."
One of the best phones I've ever used. Got the Asian variant. Everything works well. Perfect condition.
"Great phone, so far I have used it in Canada as well as the states. Will see how it works in Europe next. My only gripe is losing one of the sim cards to the SD card for expanded memory. There is a hack for this but I haven't done it yet. It involves sticking the sim chip to the back of the SD card to have a dual slot."
"It's a shame that you have to choose between placing SIM2 or MicroSD. In previous versions of DUOS you could use SIM1, SIM2 and MicroSD simultaneously."
"The most ugly phone on the high end market. Ugly oblong shape, cheap shiny plastic look, ugly design of icons, oversaturated colors even in basic mode, and messy organization of apps and screens. Extra features like pulse sensing have marginal value at best. Good features: dual simm, large screen size to phone size ratio, low weight, waterproofing do not fully compensate for ugly design. Given a chance I would go for any other phone, especially HTC."
Fast and responsive
"Excellent phone, well worth the money over the S7 due to the larger screen. This is not a fake, it is the real deal. The phone I received is an international version (dual sim) from the UAE. It came with a UK charging plug."
"Chose an 'international' model, so I can use while stationed in China and USA... actually, I loved it for 2 months, then it developed a problem which i learned was common, thick gray bars on the screen, and which should easily and clearly be under Samsung's warranty, however I have discovered that the warranty is only good in Singapore, and nowhere outside Singapore. Wasted time on the phone with Singapore, and finally learned that I am out of luck, need to pay to get it repaired. So, BEWARE!!!!!!! I am screwed with a $700.00 POS."
"Hated sending it back but this international version wouldn't work with TMo or ATT SIMs properly. Love the S7 Edge though. This dual SIM version wouldn't handle the two carriers cellular data properly. Once on wi-fi it would rarely transition to cell data without a reboot. Even then it didn't like two SIMs from different carriers. Suspect it is meant for two SIMs from the same carrier only. If I inserted a single SIM only, it worked better, but oddly my TMo SIM only got less than 1Mbps on band 12 LTE when the same SIM in a different phone pulled 15+Mbps consistently. ATT speeds when only 1 SIM inserted were consistent with other phones. If I can only use one SIM I might as well buy a single SIM US version so that wi-fi calling and VoLTE could work too, which they don't on this international version.Beyond the dual SIM issues, the Galaxy S7 Edge was a great phone. Awesome camera. Nice display."
awesome phone
Good
"All good, product (s7), delivering (Amazon.com)"
Got this phone for my husband and he absolutely love it!
"Could bem the right charger, im from brazil and is totaly different, i had to buy a new charger."
Excelente
magnificent
Everything is OK. Except the power plug is not fit to most socket.
Excelente
"another sim or microsd, you can't use two sims and the sd card at the same time"
Just greater Just great
Its gratis.
Incredible cellphone !!!
A good product
"Dual SIM unlocked (DUOS version, SM-935FD), awesome phone !Dual SIM capabilities were key to my purchase decision. This is an international version of the phone, comes carrier unlocked. I just popped my GSM / T-Mobile SIM card from my old phone (HTC One M8) into my new Samsung S7 Edge, and I was on the T-Mobile network in NYC. Do your research on LTE bands, but this phone has all the LTE bands that T-Mobile uses in the US, so I have great reception and 4G LTE available. I highly recommend for anyone who plans to do international travel to get this phone, instead of the carrier locked phones in the USA (no dual SIM available in the US)."
"To give a little back story about myself and phones, I'm that guy who has a new phone every few months. I don't break them, I just haven't been able to find something that I can get on board with for very long. This phone changes that.Pros:-Amazing battery life-Stellar performance from Samsung's exynos processor-Durable screen that is really hard to scratch or crack in general-Great rear camera with improved low-light performance over the S6-Rootable! *This is especially important to me or anyone that's really into android. This is why I no longer buy US variants of phones because carriers are making it more difficult to root and install custom ROM's-Really waterproof-SD expandabiltiy is back, as it should beCons--Edge is kinda annoying if you don't have a case. Your fingers will constantly press the sides of the screen and mess with what you are doing-No 64 or 128GB models for some reason. It's 2016 Samsung, only 32 GB?-Stock Samsung software is always atrocious in my opinion. This is why I use custom ROM's to get rid of most the pre-installed stuff-Lower camera resolution than the S6-Built in speaker sounds horrible after taking its first bath-Horrible to repairOverall, I do really like this phone still. I think I finally have found one that I will keep for some time now."
Great
"Clearly, the best cell I had so far"
The screen quality truly is fantastic and the camera is noticeably better than my family member's Iphones in tough lighting conditions. I had read the international version had a different graphics chip than US domestic. I don't know if its still true but I'm very satisfied.
Does not hold charge. Freezes a lot. Gets hated quickly. Wish I could give no star
It is a good phone.
"I like the the phone so far. Specially for the battery, the charged time is much shorter now. The phone is arriving on time. thanks"
"perfect condition, exactly as described, seal was not broken awesome phone!!"
Great!!!!
Arrived on time and and as expected.
"so far, phone has being working excellently."
Great product! I am rediscovering a true smartphone

"I FIRST EXPERIENCE ONLINE PHONE ORDERBUT REALY GOOD EXCELLENT, I M HAPPY WITH AMAZON SHOPING, AND I REALY LIKE AMAZON SHIPPING ORDER TRACKING SYSTEM."
The phone is exactly wath i expected! The only thing that i can't test if it work in Romania! In rest the phone is awesome!
"Amazing. Been using it for the past few months now. No scratches, no shatters. Perfect. Performance is fast. I dig it."
nice phone I love it
Excellent product.
"This phone appears to be exact same phone as sold in US, but the seller did include a simple plug adaptor so you can plug it into 110 v in US. Otherwise, the plug it comes with looks like the plug they use in Spain households. The phone is Duel Sim card and unlocked, but what itsn't stated is that you can have 2 SIM cards OR, 1 SIM card and 1 microSD card (which I put a 128 GB card in). I expecting it to allow all 3 at the same time. No biggy though.The phone itself looks Spectacular and the screen seems to kind of repel dust, to some extent (I baby the phone, in general). The graphics are great. I haven't registered for Samsung Pay yet, but this phone appears to allow it OK. The battery seems pretty good, and it charges VerY fast!!Also, I had apple iphone before this, and would say this is, so far, quite a bit nicer than the iphone 5 or 6. I would recommend to anyone concerned about switching from Apple to Samsung......Also, one thing that made the change Super easy was that the phone had a very small gadget in the box that allows anyone with an Apple to hook up to the new phone and it will automatically download ALL of your photos, videos and complete set of Contacts.....that was a huge relief, and that's why I hadn't changed in past. Would highly recommend the Galaxy S7 Edge. Hope this info helpful!!"
"Beware of this product guys: I bought this unlocked Samsung Galaxy phone. It is not fully compatible with T-Mobile and I am assuming that AT&T and other carriers will be the same. Important features like LTE support and wifi calling will not work. Moreover, Samsung USA does not support this phone. They asked me to talk their Asian counterparts for any issue. All in all, its waste of money."
"WARNING!! this is a fake cellphone, don't buy"
"Can't turn on/charge after 1 day normal usage. Tried force reboot/safe mode, nothing happened. Should be a FAULTY phone.DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER"
"The package was open, Late shipment,Bag was torn,The seal was broken.I'll return it.No star et all."
"No problems at all, great phone."
All fine
"I was Worried because of the reviews they give to this provider of all the missing phones or damaged phones.but let me tell you that when I received this phone it was ""obviously unsealed"" but in excellent Status no dead pixel, exactly how it was described, because of the International Version I got one from South arabia or some Asian country so it came with manual and charger from that country.But the Phone works perfectly running all the latest Updates."
Phone is amazingly fast but there is something wrong with the battery life. I only have an estimated 8 hours at 80% charged. Not even enough battery to last half a day. Will be submitting for return.
everything perfect
"I ordered Samsung galaxy S7 edge factory unlock international middle east version single Sim card, but I got the wrong order, it is samsung galaxy S7 7edge Duos/ dual Sim."
"I bought this phone in June 16 and it has been a dream. However 3 months down the road, it is bricked. I got a Bootloader Error and Samsung UK refuses to repair the phone even if I want to pay for it.The only solution is to bring it to Samsung Asia to get it fixed or alternatively, jailbreak it so as to reset the phone.Either way I am left with a phone I cannot use and no means to get any sort of refund or warranty"
The phone arrived early. Sealed. Good condition. Great phone and I'm happy with it.
Great looks and performance
By far the best phone I ever owned.
I like the product because it is new and came before the estimated date. I am well please with my order.
"Well the phone rocks, in many aspects are better then i expected but after 4 weeks CAREFUL use i found a scratch at the screen... Its tiny almost not visible actually i can only feel it not see it but its there and have no clue how in heck happened.I just ordered something actually hate it, a screen protector, it supposed S7's screen being scratch proof right? Well isn't :-("
Great Phone! Love it
great phone. cool that it can fit 2 sims. now don't need to worry about loosing sim cards.
"Hi, i bought a samsung galaxy s7 edge when i was in u.s, it is just 2 weeks old and it is really working good, but when i went home to the philippines it is always hanging and should be turn off (by long press of lower volume button and lock button) so i can use it again, at first my phone turns off and the light on top kept open i was scared so i searched for that way of turning it on again.. the second time and the rest it keeps on hanging so i needed to turn it off again that way so it will open again.. it happens to me more than 10x.. it is kinda annoying at the same time make me worried to because im too far from the origin country of the phone... is it normal to happen when you buy your phone from other country and use it here in the philippines? Or is it really the fact that it has something wrong with my phone? Thanks for response!"
The perfect phone.Make the iPhone 6 look and feel like something of the past
excelllent
Love this phone
We bought this S7 Edge to use it in Argentina (Movistar network) and it works perfectly well!
Excellent cell phone I am using two SIMs from México without problemsHighly recommended
very good quality I really like works very wellI give 5 stars
It's a wonderful phone
Wrong chargerScreen problem
It's nice but there's something wrong with the LCD display.
So Good
"I've owned many different phones over the years. My first real smart phone was a Samsung S3 and was a great phone. I recently purchased this S7 Edge and can say it is the best phone I've ever had. I recommend getting the International version like mine. All the chatter about it on the Web is spot on. It is the fastest, smoothest, best of everything in a smart phone that money can buy today. My ONLY complaint is that TouchWiz needs more work. I really want to use it but ended up back to Nova launcher to get basic features, like vertical app drawer scroll and such. TouchWiz needs more features control to truly be useful. However this has nothing to do with how wonderful the S7 Edge International 935FD truly is!"
Great device!
Looks and work beautifully. Recommend to purchase from this vendor
"While my Galaxy S7 Edge order was in transit, I asked this seller (Wireless Place and/or TechnoMaster, not sure what the name story is there) whether this shipped with a USA A/C outlet power adapter (2 flat prongs), or the international adapter (2 round prongs, spaced further apart). They promptly replied that it ships with the latter/international, and added that they'd send me a USA adapter, for free... it arrived 4 days after the phone arrived. Nice.But I found that I was not getting Samsung's ""Quick Charge"" feature, which touts ""Fast battery charging: 60% in 30 min (Quick Charge 2.0)."" Yes, I did have Settings > Fast Cable Charging enabled, and no there was no ""Fast Charging: XX%"" popup message when connecting to A/C power. The phone was only estimating, and achieving, only about 1% charge increase per 2 minutes. I messaged this seller and told of the problem, to which they replied:""this is very normal that the last 30% or so takes a longer time to charge. the phone takes around 2 to 3 hours to charge and that is normal. mine does exactly the same thing. i suggest you do a hard reset but i am sure if you get another S7 that is the same you will get the same result. thanks""I'd already researched this ""common S7 problem"", and resolved it. It turned out the ""Samsung Adaptive Fast Charging"" USA power adapter this seller sent me for free, was fake/counterfeit-- it DID WORK to charge at normal (slow) speed, but DIDN'T WORK for the Quick Charge 2.0 feature, despite having all the right markings. The fake was noticeably lighter weight; different shape; the text color was darker, and the specs side of it was quite different, compared to the genuine (international version) Samsung A/C adapter which came with the S7.Resolution was my buying a simple International-to-USA A/C power outlet adapter, and using it with the (genuine) Samsung Adaptive Fast Charging adapter which came with the phone, with its included USB cable.So this seller did deliver exactly what I ordered; a genuine Galaxy S7 Edge with genuine Samsung Adaptive Fast Charging adapter & USB cable... all on time, so no grievance there. And I can give them the benefit of the doubt as not knowing that the USA A/C adapter they sent me for FREE (above/beyond the call of duty), was in fact fake/counterfeit. Where they disappointed was in their reply to my followup query about Quick Charge not working, telling me only that the slow charging rate (about 2 mins per 1% increase) I was getting, was normal/proper; meanwhile their own S7 Edge product page touts the standard Quick Charge 2.0 feature. I did reply to this seller explaining the (fake Samsung USA adapter) problem and my resolution, including the pic attachments here, but I heard no further reply from them. So ""No Harm No Foul"" with this seller; but if I hadn't done my own research and resolved the Quick Charge problem, I'd be living with slow charging only."
Loving it
"The seal arrived broken, the film protect was scratched and there was a dust between the display and film protection.The mobile is not a new one"
good
Unlocked for sure! Currently using it in Japan with a NTT Docomo chip. Tested the phone by playing music in the shower.
The phone didn't work
"I did quite a bit of research before buying a new smartphone. This phone is a bit pricey, but I decided to purchase it since it was one of the nicest phones that I seen. Also I knew that I would be taking good care of this device and would keep it for a while. I decided to purchase the international version that was unlocked so that I could select my GSM carrier. The phone was in excellent new condition with an adapter for US power supply. The phone is fast and I use the Wi-Fi router in my home for data usage to save on carrier costs. This is an excellent phone and I would highly recommend it."
"Product is good but easily Screen Cracked even was it in case and Samsung Service Center (in INDIA) is not able to replace screen(by paid service) as IEMI number is not visible in Theier system. Samsung Customer Support confirmed this will not be able to fixed in INDIA21-Aug-16: Increased One Start for Amazon , the customer support from Amazon is great and they are able me help."
What a great phone .I'm satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy phone...how could I put insurance on my phone
"I chose this model because it has two slots for nano sim, works perfect in Argentina , highly recommended ORIGINAL"
"Everything as expected, the description readed in reviews and on Samsung webpage, are pretty acurrate."
It seems that his is the best smartphone who was created in this period !
"Perfect! I got everything fast. The box was sealed, phone's excellent! Love it!!!"
returned because it came open the safety seal
It says the phone is not compatible with samsung pay? Why what is the issue
The package is empty.Whats Happened????? I need a explain!
Very fast shipping and very fast phone... Really great!
I upgraded to this phone from a Galaxy Note III and it is loads better - faster; better screen; much better camera (LOVE the camera). The display is so clear and colourful it is simply a joy to hold and behold. Any drawbacks? You do have to hold it carefully so you aren't pressing the wrap-around screen and confusing it with what you want to do. Worth it? you bet
Everything is OK with the phone.only the smart screen shot cant use.i don't know why.i tried a lot of time.
The phone is a phenomenal piece of equipment. I was a previous Note 5 user and have found this phone superior in every way. I only miss the stylus for performing detailed writing task but otherwise I love the speed and display. The battery life is quite good as well. It makes it through an entire day without having to be charged!
"The phones arrived as described factory unlocked, unopened in new condition"
Love love my phone!
"excellent product,works great"
Very good mobile
Cheap flimsy quality.
great phone
"As expected, arrived on time and working perfectly with 2 Simms"
"Had to get rid of my Galaxy Note 7 due to the well publicized issues. Replaced it with the S7 edge. Nice phone but NOT as functional. No Stylus, No screen scroll capture, smaller screen. In general, an ok temporary replacement but SAMSUNG has better get something on the market that has the Galaxy Note 7 features (without the meldtowns)."
Everything ok!!!
"Do not purchase. Bought this phone a few months ago and now I have a row of dead pixels. Never dropped or had water damage. It was fine in the morning and when I took it out of my pocket, I noticed the pixels died. For me, it goes away randomly and always returns in an hour or so."
"Very nice phone except for a MAJOR problem with DUAL SIM operation. The reason for a Dual Sim phone is for the purpose of staying ""connect"" in a fast paced world. This phone does not allow you to have Mobile Data available when both Sims are active, it simply shuts off when both sims are selected. Between T-Mobile and Samsung, the problem could not be resolved. The answer was ""just have ONE SIM active and Mobile Data will work"". Wrong reason for me when I have 3 Asus phones working perfectly fine with Dual sim operation on T-Mobile. VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED."
Excellent product.
Ok. Good. Noticias excellent.
The seller was good at communication . The only problem was tht the seal looked liked tampered but the seller assurred me that it was a new mobile and the seal was broken to unlock the mobile . And you get only 1 month warranty which is bad . Overall the product is ok and running good
"LCD damaged within 2 months, it either flickers a lot or there is a green line a few pixels thick in the curved display.I wish it has stopped working within first month, at least in that case I could have returned the phone.And I handled the phone with utmost care, and yes no water testing or anything of that sort."
Love the phone!! .. I use it with AT&T and works without any problems.
My son loved it
Item was delivered just as advertised! Working just fine with 2 sim cards in Brazil!
the phone was as it was described.great phone.
"I love my phone. The phone is working as I would expect a Samsung smartphone to work.The color is amazing (the picture does not do the phone any justice), the weight and size are just right and the folks from Mobiles International, LLC, did an excellent job describing it.I highly recommend this company and I will definitely buy from them again!"
"S7 edge is an excellent phone, but the seal was broken (hence opened). And I can't download Samsung Pay from Google play store!! Which is a big disappointment! It shows that Samsung Pay isn't compatible with this device!"
"it is no doubt that s7 edge is a good phone,but it is opened by someone,the seal is broken.and i can't download Samsung Pay from Google play store. it shows that Samsung Pay doesn't compatible with this device."
"Back glass got cracked after half a day of use - I didn't even drop the phone - just got it hit the door in the pocket of my hoody. Probably it's not about the phone itself, but about this particular vendor - I've heard there are models on sale with cheaper back. The packaging was strange as well - for international version I would expect something different from singaporian plug."
Arrived timely manner.Great product.
Switched from iPhone 6 ... so much better!!!
Way better than i expected.The battery is the best that I ever saw.
Dual SIM International Version!
"Everything you've read about this phone is true. It is amazing. The screen is second only to the S7 (in terms of ppi), the camera is arguably the best on the market, and it is a monster in battery life and performance. Silver Titanium is undoubtedly the best color. Absolutely stunning. If Samsung found a way to implement stereo audio, it would be perfect, but it makes up for what it lacks in sound quality in its relative loudness and top of the line headphone output. Rest assured that you are buying the best phone on the market right now.--------------------------------Compliment it with a Spigen Neo Hybrid Crystal (I 100% recommend Gunmetal for a Silver Titanium GS7 Edge): http://amzn.com/B01AUORACQand a Armorsuit Case Friendly Screen Shield: http://amzn.com/B01ACXSKAG"
Great
I got my new galaxy s7 duos and the package came on time and good status.
Excellent
Package received without the actual phone which was probably stolen on the way

Awesome. With russian language. 100% official. Love it!
Perfect phone. fast and beautiful
"The Best phone in market at this moment!7 reasons to buy it:1. Most beautiful design in the world2. SuperAMOLED display3. Camera is the best (12mpx, Opt.stab bla bla bla...)4. IP68 waterproof5. Wireless charge, quick charge6. Always on dislpay7. Memory 32Gb (DualSim/MicrSD up to 200Gb)"
"WTF This is should be an International Asia Version .I have a Verizon unlocked !!! Tell me why !!And the first page , shows that somebody has already set up the phone !look at the photos,please. the phone was Sold by: TechnoMaster"
"Good products, good service, excellent price."
"Good battery life, good camera, amazing features."
Very good
I was surprised that the unit could only either take 1 sim card and one memory card or two sim cards. Really have to read the fine print these days to know what you're getting. :/
Very satisfied ans so far so Great.
My phone is broken without drop and water.
I still want the same phone but the USA version of it! I discovered that i can't access so many things with this one in USA and the charger is also different from what we use here.I really need a quick assistance to get another one as replacement.thanks
All perfect
Shipped very fast. Box was sealed.. Only the English charger problem. Buy you can also find a converter for 2$.. Dual sim is working.. thanks.
Increíble!!!
It's good but after I bought then they have the recall for product.
Very Good!
Does not hold charge. Freezes a lot. Gets hated quickly. Wish I could give no star
It is a good phone.

"another sim or microsd, you can't use two sims and the sd card at the same time"
Just greater Just great
AFTER A MONTH OF USAGE THE SCREEN HAS BLURY BLACK LINES WHEN I CHANGE THE LIGHT TO LOW.
"Not as described - it is not equipment with ""Dual-core 2.15 GHz Kryo & dual-core 1.6 GHz Kryo"" (Snapdragon 820). This is the international version that is using a different CPU."
Amazing phone as I'm sure your aware. Taking off a star for its only problem which is the edges can be very annoying when you are holding it and it registers a touch at the side. This is its biggest problem that many people complain about. Possibly a deal breaking issue I would probably go with the s7 tbh if I was buying again. In terms of the international thing it's no big deal exactly the same except it comes with a foreign plug and they include an adapter which is nice. Everything was in English and phone setup went flawlessly. The Asia version is dual sim compatible which is the only difference from the EU version as far as I can tell and find online. So go for that one. Keep in mind it will only work on GSM carriers such as tmobile and at&the and nothe with CDMA like Verizon
Very good
The edge is a terrible design unless you hold your phone in the palm of your hand and never touch the sides.
"I received a fake phone. It doesn't even have a spot for the Sim Card, neither does it charges or turns on. Some S7 details are literally drawn on the plastic. It's just a piece of plastic on a Galaxy S7 shape."
Just as specified....excellent
liked it
Great looks and performance
By far the best phone I ever owned.
It is very intuitive and easy to use.
Why my cell phone is not same with picture of the back
Loved It !
Excellent phone. two thumps up
"Delivered on time, the best cell of all. Great screen, easy and comfortable handling. Great long lasting battery. Incredible pictures. Love my cell!!!!!"
awesome
"Ecxellent seller, high recommended"
I'm still seeing how it works for the Casio men`s
"all very correct, fast , good priducto ."
"I bought mine from NPG USA Store, was shipped from hong kong but everything looks great. Works fine, a adaptor was also included with the phone."
"I FIRST EXPERIENCE ONLINE PHONE ORDERBUT REALY GOOD EXCELLENT, I M HAPPY WITH AMAZON SHOPING, AND I REALY LIKE AMAZON SHIPPING ORDER TRACKING SYSTEM."
The phone is exactly wath i expected! The only thing that i can't test if it work in Romania! In rest the phone is awesome!
"Amazing. Been using it for the past few months now. No scratches, no shatters. Perfect. Performance is fast. I dig it."
nice phone I love it
Excellent product.
"This phone appears to be exact same phone as sold in US, but the seller did include a simple plug adaptor so you can plug it into 110 v in US. Otherwise, the plug it comes with looks like the plug they use in Spain households. The phone is Duel Sim card and unlocked, but what itsn't stated is that you can have 2 SIM cards OR, 1 SIM card and 1 microSD card (which I put a 128 GB card in). I expecting it to allow all 3 at the same time. No biggy though.The phone itself looks Spectacular and the screen seems to kind of repel dust, to some extent (I baby the phone, in general). The graphics are great. I haven't registered for Samsung Pay yet, but this phone appears to allow it OK. The battery seems pretty good, and it charges VerY fast!!Also, I had apple iphone before this, and would say this is, so far, quite a bit nicer than the iphone 5 or 6. I would recommend to anyone concerned about switching from Apple to Samsung......Also, one thing that made the change Super easy was that the phone had a very small gadget in the box that allows anyone with an Apple to hook up to the new phone and it will automatically download ALL of your photos, videos and complete set of Contacts.....that was a huge relief, and that's why I hadn't changed in past. Would highly recommend the Galaxy S7 Edge. Hope this info helpful!!"
"Beware of this product guys: I bought this unlocked Samsung Galaxy phone. It is not fully compatible with T-Mobile and I am assuming that AT&T and other carriers will be the same. Important features like LTE support and wifi calling will not work. Moreover, Samsung USA does not support this phone. They asked me to talk their Asian counterparts for any issue. All in all, its waste of money."
"WARNING!! this is a fake cellphone, don't buy"
I wish there was an outer box for these phone
Legit seller New Sealed Galaxy S7 Dual SIM as PromisedThank you
Exactly as promised. Was worried I wouldn't be able to activate it with an American carrier (since the included documentation indicated that might be a problem as opposed to requiring a European carrier to activate it first) but it worked fine.
Why the phone doesnt say galaxy s7 edge on the back ?
I love it.... it works get on metro pcs. I live in NYC. No complaints
"I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935F in Black from this product page a week ago.A lot of people have asked questions about this particular international version so I'll answer some of those first. For starters, the one I got was the english edition for the Saudi Arabia market (see attached photos, the guides came in english and arabic). From what I can tell, the phone is the same as any other international edition but with different preinstalled apps. Mine came with a SA region specific app ""Shaid"" (seems to be a YouTube-esque app in arabic) that I uninstalled and WhatsApp. Other than that the only remaining bloatware was stock Samsung apps (no carrier apps, thank god), the only other thing I noticed that may be region specific is the S Planner app has a ""Hijri dates adjustment"" setting. Lastly this version ships with a non-us wall charger (aside from the regular stock accessories) shown in my review images. Mine also came with an adapter for use within the U.S., I have tried it and can confirm that it works with fast charging.This phone also uses a different chipset (manufactured by Samsung, called Exynos 8890) than the U.S. version. Reviews I read noted that the phone was actually optimized for this chipset w/ better performance and battery life than the U.S. Qualcomm counterpart (Google it). In the U.S. version the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip is used to support Verizon and Sprint customers whereas this version only supports GSM carriers.To preface the review of the actual use of the phone, I have owned the following devices and used them each as a daily driver for at least a months time: Samsung Galaxy S4 GPE, Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, HTC One M8 GPE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P. The Galaxy S7 Edge has been the most delightful experience of the bunch. I won't go into great detail here but the camera is phenomenal and launches faster than any other phone I've owned w/ a double tap of the home button. The camera's auto focus is super fast and I feel like I'm able to get a capture a lot of moments that my previous phones were too slow to shoot. It's also nice to be able to change the quick launch apps on the lock screen, I have the dialer and snapchat as mine.Continuing a theme of high performance this phone is incredibly fast despite powering a QHD resolution screen. Apps are surprisingly quick to load and multitasking is a breeze (I even found some use in the Samsung's split screen feature). The fingerprint scanner is on par with apple devices (and nexus 6p/5x) although because of it's non-circular shape I find that I place my finger the wrong way more often. The battery is the best of any device I've used as a daily driver, I've been able to get through days of heavy usage like today (unplugged from charger at 5:45am, now at 25% at 9:03pm).The screen is BEAUTIFUL. Not only is it easy to read even in direct sunlight (something I have seen other devices struggle with) but the colors are vibrant and the screen is huge without making the phone too big or bulky. Perfect for watching YouTube videos and browsing instagram.Lastly a few notes if you buy this phone:- If you're not a fan of the stock Samsung launcher you can get the Google Now launcher from the Play Store, it's the same one used on Nexus devices and feels smoother than Samsung's launcher.- This time around Samsung decided to give you bigger icons which drove me nuts, search for ""Get more on your Galaxy S7, S6 or Note 5 screen with hidden DPI scaling settings"" from Android authority to get a 5th column on the home screen and smaller UI elements.- ""Edge functionality"" is just okay. The feature feels a bit less than polished because of the weak offerings in the Samsung app store - I have it turned off.Edit 4/8/2016: sorry about the quality of the photos of the actual phone - they were shot with the wide angle lens of my GoPro whereas the other images were shot with the S7 Edge.Edit 4/10/2016: added some higher quality images from my new camera.Update 5/9/2016: I've been using the phone as a daily driver for over a month now. I'm still impressed by the overall gfx smoothness, how fast apps load, and camera performance.Update 7/25/2016: still in love with this phone. I'm honestly not sure what would compel me to purchase a new phone at this point.. I also rooted the phone and changed the emojis to the iOS 9 set with the Emoji Switcher app from the play store. No more guessing when messaging my iOS friends =)A lot of commenters have asked which seller I purchased mine from: Wireless Everything."
Great phone. Got it today and it's absolutely beautiful. Can't wait to give it to my boyfriend as a birthday present he will love it. So far IL very please and I'm sure I won't regret the purchase!
You must buy this phone!!!! Much better than iPhone!!!!
Very good item and fast shipping
"Although my shipping experience was a bit troublesome, the product itself its amazing! I knew it was international version but was not expecting a UK plug, best part is I get almost not bloatware"
"awesome phone, excellent camera, i bought 3 of these phones"
This is literally my first review because I never had a product that deserved my time...until I got this phone! It's absolutely the most amazing phone I have ever seen!Couldn't be happier!
The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge got here on time and in great conditions it works great.
I'm sure you've seen tons of reviews about the phone so if you are going to get it this is a good place to do so.
"on time ,no problem ."
"Great phone, very happy"
Good
"The phone it is ok.. but the charger dont work it for me, i am from latino america and the charger have an entrance different.. now i am looking for a charger in my country.. i paid 700$ and i can not charge my smartphone......"
"Greatest phone ever.I have used it for 9 days already and it's awesome.My only complaint is the lack of good glass screen protectors.First off the camera,it's awesome,although it's pretty similar to the S6.I wish they stayed at 16mp as it was 16:9 but otherwise, its great.It even has a wider angle,when zooming it had a tiny bit better quality than the S6 and autofocus is extremely fast.Low light was obviously insaneThe battery, this was one of my main concern with my S6 and the S7E battery is very good.The first days which tend to be pretty bad for battery life, where surprisingly good.I even had to drain it's battery sometimes.But to be honest it perfomed a bit worse than I expected, i mean, it's waaay better than the S6,but as a student I thought it would last me a bit more.I read articles on people saying they used their phone heavily and ended the day at 11:30 with 20 percent battery life(that was using bluetooth,nfc,location and wifi/lte on as they said) and in my experience, I have finished days with 35% battery from 7am to 11pm but only using either wifi or mobile data,no bluetooth or nfc,no location services on.So I think mi phone's battery is stabilizing yet(if someone can tell me if im right say it please!).As a student, I don't use my phone for long periods from 7 to 4pm.Maybe 15 min intervals or 30 minutes using gallery for photos,what really surprised me is that battery drained pretty fast sometimes and sometimes it almost didn't drain,which is weird.That's why I think it may be normal for the fist weeks(again,correct me if i'm wrong)BTW, I don't use powersaving,which I did on the s6 alwaysPower wise, It's an extremely powerful phone which can manage literally anything,and there's no lag with power saving on or off.There's not much to say.The phone is a bit bigger than the s6 and s6 edge.I strongly recommend it"
Cause it has everything.
Sleek phone. Looks great! A good size not too large. Fits well in my hand. Great camera and sound quality. Battery lasts for a day.
Phone seems refurbished. Google programs skip and it seems like it has a lapse from time to time. Slower than I expected and because of this I am afraid to test to see if it's waterproof as its supposeductive to be.
Great!
Product doesn't have US warranty! Came with a scratch when I unboxed the phone and 10 days later my display started flickering.
Very good product
It malfunction
Everything was perfect. Customers services is a also great if you need help with something .
I love it
Great Phone!
Despite I ve bought a latam cell phone version The charger is not for any country in this region. Hope when I arrive to my country the phone set works perfectly ....
For the price you can't beat it. However the international phones do not support wifi calling nor does it support android pay. So it's up to you if those are deal breakers to you
I love the phone when it was working. Since it is an unlocked device no one seems to want to take responsibility for repairing it under warranty. I am having the famous grey line problem which seems to be a pretty wide spread problem with this phone.Samsung customer service is terrible. I have spent hours trying to find a way to get my device serviced and keep getting told to call someone else or someone will call me back in 24 to 48 hours and no one ever calls back.For Samsung customer service alone I will not buy another Samsung device ever again.
"Two weeks after I bought it, it got problem. :(it got wet and failing the microphone, I hated it because I was told that the water proof was really good. Take care with SAMSUNG."
I love the phone. Seller ships on time. Brand new unopened box.
"Love this phone, only problem i had was i didn't know you needed a nano SIM card. I had a regular SIM card and it cost me another $20 to go to get. But other than that it's going to be great I love it and I think I might have it for a really long time, unless Samsung comes out with something way better than this."
Best phone ever.
Item came as described.

It's an awesome phone for sure.
Love it.
Excellent mobile phone. Beautiful design with the best camera !
I use this phone good
Great
"I purchased this S7 edge back in March. After two months, it started showing some screen color issues with annoying purple stripes all over the screen and the cellphone itself feels hot. I had to set the brightness to the maximum to temporarily ""avoid"" screen issues. And what's worse, the screen just died completely and I can't even turn off this phone since the screen is no longer functioning. Now I am trying to return this failed S7 edge and get my money back and never gonna buy any Samsung product again."
"excellent product, very good quality, I recommend"
exccelent product
"incredible, very satisfied and recommended"
Seal appeared to be broken when I first opened the package. Phone is the best I have ever experienced so far. Be careful with these international phones if you are a US buyer.
I am still in love with my samsung galaxy s7 edge a month later. I hope nothing will change.
This cell work perfect good.
Amazing unlocked phone! Currently using it in Mexico with a prepaid ATT Sim card and everything is great! Very high quality photos in front and in the back of the phone. The metal finish is very high quality! Love it!
"I got the exynos version. The phone works great. The phone is fast in switching between app and windows. The edge panel can be very useful if u arrange it to your need.Two best thing: the screen is wonderful - vivid colors very high brightness, one of the best screen by far; the battery - so powerful, i can use my phone for all day and the battery will not dead.Overall i am very-very satisfied with my s7 edge."
"Waaaaay better than my iPhone. Can't say enough good things about it so I'll leave it at this: if you don't have one, you're missing out."
Excelente
feels too bulky I'm glad I bought a new iPhone 7 much slimmer and miles ahead in voice quality
Love my phone Samsung is a boss
The charger comes with the UK Plug. Would have been nice to know it before buying it.
I cannot make video call
Excellent!!!!!!
Todo ok..!!
Excellent cellphone. Battery is amazing.
"I received this phone yesterday and instantly fell in love with it. I have owned several Galaxy phones (s3, s4, s4 active, and s5). So far I love it! It came sealed in the original box. I cannot use the charger adapter that came with it, but I expected that as it's an international version.I picked the gold color, it looks and feels elegant and sleek. I love the interface, the phone itself is super fast. The phone has a big, beautifully bright screen. I am still getting used to its size. The fingerprint scanner is noticeably better than that of the gs5. Both cameras take amazing pictures.I am one of those people that are constantly on their phones during most of the day. It has an excellent battery life and charges very fast.I did read a couple reviews where people complained about the phone slipping out of their hands. I have used an Otterbox Symmetry Series case since I took it out of the box and have not had that problem at all.My only complaint about this phone is that it does not have an IR blaster, but I can live with that.I will update my review in the future if anything changes.UPDATE:I have been using this phone for about a month now and it is still just as amazing as when I took it out of the box. It still has amazing battery life. I have a Pocket Juice power bank that I was using around noon every day with my Gs5 but I have not used it at all with this phone. It usually still has 15% after about 12 hours of use.I have not had any lagging or random restarts like I did with my Gs5. The phone is still amazingly fast and responsive.I have slightly tested the waterproofing of this phone. The fingerprint scanner does not work well when wet, but the touch screen is still responsive.I have a Otterbox Symmetry Series case that I use with this phone and I have noticed that it causes the Zagg Dry screen protector to bubble up around the edges (I would like to state that I did NOT allow the protector 24 hours to ""cure"" after applying before putting the case back on, so that could be the reason.) I have heard that with the edges it is hard to find a case/screen protector combination that doesn't cause bubbling at the edges.Overall I would definitely recommend this phone."
excellent service and product
Great
It is a great original phone which registered in United Arab Emirates. That's why that cheap.
Excelent Phone
The phone is great the only thing is that I have a charger for Europe not for the US
It was everything that was expected 👍👍
"When Samsung removed the ability to add removable storage to their line of phones I quickly defected. A short stint was run with LG and Motorola/Lenovo and now, with the S7 Edge I'm happily back in Samsung's court.I've been using Samsung devices since before the Galaxy line and have had each device save for the badly thought out S6 and Note 5. The S7 Edge is superior to the former iterations and I am happy to say that not only is the hardware beyond average but the software has been updated to not only run smoothly but also detracts from the excessive bloatware and creates a much more pleasant overall user experience.The Edge feature, while still gimicky I feel, does have its uses but I feel that like the S-Pen on the Note line you will either use it extensively or not at all. In the end though this is a wonderful upgrade and a welcomed return to the ability of having 200GB in my phone in addition to the onboard storage option."
"wonderful and fast! for those whos out of US, I can advise. sent to Angola and works beautiful..."
phone started to flicker by itself green color and now is just black display.
Excelent product
The best phone ever. Great camera. Buy it.
phone would not work unless plugged into the charger and its got an internal battery so i had to return it brand new phone
Work with metropcs YEAH
It's awesome. Using it now to type this
It's perfect!!
It is easy usage.
It met my expectations
"The best phone you will ever have, can handle many applications in background and it still responds as expected, zero lags and the curved screen is the best.The phone came with the AC adaptor as it's for Africa but I had no problems at all, the quick charge is just amazing and the battery lasts the whole day (5am to 11pm) with no need to additional battery charges.Go for the gold version it's the most classy one. Some photos that I took they look so real. Enjoy!"
"Original, reliable."
"I really like the phone, but nobody mentioned that Samsung Pay does not work with this, the international version - I had to call Samsung Support to find that out.. disappointed and send it back for that reason..."
Great. Fabolous. I love it.
amazing phone and the service from this guys is absolutely exceptional
This phone what can I say .... it's fast nice feel to it .... no lag... Samsung will be samsung they will only get better and better...
I've been using this phone for around a month now and I got hacked 3 times! 3 times!
A really good buy....am impressed with my purchase. Will buy again.
Perfect
Good
Love this phone and lack of AT&T bloatware. Wished Samsung Pay worked with the 935F or at least the firmware/locality I received.
"Got the s7 edge, was working really good. Then suddenly something happened with the screen, the whole right side of the screen is blinking and all the colors look really bad, i wanna return it and get a new one, i think that if after 37 days that happens i deserve to get a new one. Edit :Screen stopped working completely, Samsung USA not taking responsibility, amazon don't take responsibility, don't buy from the seller"
This Is the best phone I ever have. It is a must buy
"Hi guys, I am using my new Galaxy S7 Edge about 1 1/2 month, and your charger stop working, this device have some kind of warranty? i am currently living in Ecuador.Regards."
I love my phone. Good condition. Beautiful. And not too expensive for this item. Thank you.
Good product.
Love my new phone
"Excellent Smartphone. Great Camera, Awesome for multimedia."
"Incompatible with AT&T, no 4G reception"
Solid phone
Received product excellent phone.
This phone is manufactured for Asia market so if you live outside Asia you will not have it fixed by Samsung in you country!
very good
Arrived early!! I was a bit hesitant getting the new S7 on amazon with not many reviews but Amazon hasn't failed me yet so I took the plunge and ordered it. I tested it with the Genuine Galaxy app and its a genuine unlocked Samsung phone. It works with my phone provider (in Jamaica). I am so in love with the phone.Everything is working really good.
"This phone is definitely one of the fastest on the market at the moment. I have dropped it several times on hard floors, and there is no visible damage at all. I have also handled it with wet hands, and it still works flawlessly. Although, the fingerprint scanner doesn't get along with water drips. The edge screen is a great addition, and I have gotten use out of the news feature when the phone is locked. The battery life is great, since it lasts about a day with moderate to heavy use.Also, for those who are wondering, this model supports most LTE bands, and it is also supported by most GSM carriers. I use it with Metro PCS, and it works perfectly."
Awesome
Fast and great
"Is a beautiful design, I a m getting used to it still many apps and actions that I need to control"
excellent! everithing ok! GREAT
The best android phone Samsung has ever made.
The phone is perfect!!!
Excelente
This phone is fantastic. That is all. Everything I can say has been said.
"I usually read reviews bedore ordering anything, and therefore I was very anxious while ordering the phone. Various users various experiences.But for me, i got a good deal on device. I got it whithin a week. And its a Latin American version with US wall charger.And so far device is performing as it should be.10/10"
Excellent Very thank you
Phone stop working in 3 months
"Hello, shipping has come to the House of my friend in Miami. I traveled the day November 15, that day I will know if you are all well. thank you."
"The seal was broken. The phone was completely fine, and it is the original phone. Other than that, all as is to be expected - great product!"
"Everything as expected, better than punctual. I missed that the charger was not compatible with 110w plug but it came with a converter."
It's an excellent phone very fest and he has an excellent reception. Also the battery is very very good doesn't run out but if you have small end it's hard with the hedge
"If I had the option of voting ""Zero"" stars I would. I bought my Galaxy S7 Edge and paid full price for it less than 7 months ago. Now the phone is presenting a hardware problem which was already acknowledged by Samsung that it is a factory problem, what means, they know it is their problem and that they are supposed to get it fixed or exchanged. However, because it is an ""Unlocked International Version"", no Samsung authorized service would even touch the phone. Not even if I am paying for the service. So, now I have a USD 800 paper weight worth nothing at all. I hope Samsung is reading this. I have been a Samsung Loyal customer since Galaxy S II and now I am dropping this ""Loyalty"" for a Windows Phone (yeah, Windows Phone. After wasting my money with a ""Samsung Flagship"", a windows Phone is all I could afford to buy). Thanks Samsung, you have made an (ex) customer really (un)happy !!!!!!"
"My boyfriend got this phone over the summer, and he actually likes it much better than his former iPhone. It comes with earbuds, a charging cable, and a very useful charging adaptor to accommodate different charging ports. I personally think it's too big, but I have small hands haha. Overall, a very reliable phone that works really well."
"phone is good, but the seller is a swindler"
Way better than buying carrier branded and bloated version. Awesome phone!
Amazing phone
package was sent with the warranty seal opened however the seller clarified the reason of that. Phone works fine.My previous phone was a Samsung 5 but this one is amazing.
It is very good
"Love the phone so far, haven't really used it yet. But the charger is not compatible with the outlets here. Really disappointed about that, because now I have to either purchase another or find an adapter. Is there anywhere in the description that stated this was the type of charger used?"
Best mobile ever
"This item was received on April 21. On May 14, I filed a request to return the item since there are problems. Runs hot. Locks up and does not reset. The supplier, Worldwide Distributors responded on May 16, stating that I needed to contact Samsung Tech Support directly, providing no contact information for Samsung. Mind you, this is within the 30 day return window, but they never mentioned this in their response. I have contacted both them and Samsung and ALL i get is a run around. I cannot use the phone and I am not asking for my money back, I need a working phone."
Great phone
"Great device with so much to offer. I recommend buying from the seller, ""Mobiles International LLC."" They sent a new and reliable device and honored a warranty for a defective product on Samsung's behalf. :)"
Worldwide Distributors great job.
The unit tells me IT IS NOT registered On NETWORK and does not allow me to make calls.
"This phone is AMAZING. The display is gorgeous, it takes some time to get used but it totally worth it. This phone works great in argentina's network and i am having a pretty rough time trying to kill the battery it just doesn't want to give up."
all ok
Powerful tool!
Exelent Phone!
Great phone
Thanks amazing
"the phones is a very nice one , works great ..."
Excelent
awesomw...!
Everything is good
Very good quality
Great
"Till now is very good, and I have it for 2 weeks. But I hope to be the same because I have a friend who had the same phone and her display was buried after one month and I heard that other people had the same problem"
cool
"I would like to report the following: 3 days ago after charged my cell phone it had a burst and broke the glass of Case Battery Door Cover the back, after the fact the battery does not hold more charge. Now I would like to know what will happen ?!!!"
Don't buy these phones because you will have to stand the loss like I did. I purchase this phone in July and when I returned home and start using the phone overheated and burnt the screen. I payee 400 USD to get it fixed and it still haven't fix properly and all Amazon did was sent me $150 for my troubles! I had a loss. I'm out of the country and not returning until May. My business with Amazon with Electronics are DONE! Even after fix there are two shades of light in the phone and the technician said it's a software problem. He said I should contact Samsung. I just gave up on everything.
Very nice.
"Shipment arrived on time. So far, the best phone I've owned. Takes some effort to locate and update the device firmware."
"The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a awesome phone, worth the price! Grateful to have compared to other smartphones."
best way of online shopping for people who work on cruise ships
Works great worth the buy
all perfect!
Great phone. Improved battery life. Awesome camera.
"Problems with my product samsung galaxy s7 edge:1. Samsung galaxy s7 edge Box was not sealed2. It was labelled International version at the bottom of the box and also labelled American sim only at the back of the box3. After starting the device, I noticed the bottom right corner of the screen had a little blacked out portion on the display itself. (maybe damaged item was sent)4. When I opened the unsealed box, content was not arranged as it should be ideally. (It was messed up)"
Amazing smartphone. It's highly recommended
Broken phone!!!!!
Because the wife likes it
Good
"I love my S7 edge, the only thing is sometimes gets too hot."
Factory seal was open and phone appears to be tampered with. Not sure if phone is a genuine Samsung phone or a knock off. Also weird software installed on phone as well. Not sure what else is installed. Will be returning ASAP.
It's a really good cell phone. The delivery time was great.
it Was perfect
"Shipped immediately, phone is amazing! Very happy with this purchase!!"

This is an excellent product
NICE

the best
Shipped in a reasonable time frame and worked with my carrier (t-mobile). First time I have ever bought a phone outside my carrier so I did a lot of research and I am well pleased with the result. The processor (this one has the international processor--much faster than the US processor) and battery life is wonderful!!! Right now it's 5:04pm and it's been off the charger & heavy use since 7am and I have 60% battery!
i only had my phone for about 3 weeks and the screen start jumping rapidly
The phone is good except the phone's charger is not the US version.
very good quality Amazon good job
"Telephone edge Dandy Yes, it's a phone in the top extravaganza I've loved phone I am very happy very, very strong"
"Love the phone I bought (black onyx). Works very well. Great camera, great screen sensitvity and charges quickly. The only downside is that I have to use a converter with the fast charging cord. I find it cumbersome although it works well. I guess it was made for a British market."
"It's everything i hoped for in a cellphone. It is fast, beautiful,though the camara doesn't really take great pictures in low light or dark spaces. Eveything else is just perfect!"
You can't go wrong this phone is awesome....
the machine.very good
"Samsung has made an absolutely Spectacular Phone with the Galaxy S7 Edge. Perfect Size; fits and feels well in the hand. Easy to use, the touch screen is brilliant, easy to see even outdoors, clear and crisp and the special edge feature of the screen makes this the most beautiful cell phone ever made. And that is just the beginning.The Camera in the New Galaxy S7 rivals many of the cameras you can buy for hundreds and hundreds of dollars! You can take Incredible photos in low light, great videos, even HD Video recording and much more. Removable Storage has come back with the Galaxy S7 and now you can insert micro SD cards with as much as 200GB of storage.You pay for high quality and the Galaxy 7 isn't cheap. But it is well worth it. BUY The New Galaxy S7 - you won't be disappointed."
"I'm very happy with this phone, fast hasn't fail and I had it for a week, I will update if things change but overall it's a winner"
"I already did wrote a awesome review for this phone, I even inspired myself like I was writing a poem and I gave 4 star to the phone but after 1 month and some days of use it started giving me problems, the phone restarts randomly out of nowhere, that has happened like 5 times and the then today I was just playing music and the lockscreen didn't work and the whole screen went black and none of the buttons were working to turn on the screen so I had it to do a massive restart, good thing it didn't erased all my stuff. I don't know if it has warranty or not but I'll be happy if I get my $850 back that I worked so hard."
Good job! I found my item on time!!
"Great looks, camera, speedy.Overall great device."
was not for me
Amazing phone
Absolutely love the phone. Best purhase I ever made!
"The screen, the edge, pictures are GORGEOUS! What's not to love!"
Like very much.
"I'm really liking this phone. To be fair this is my first flagship phone. I'm coming from a cheap Nokia Lumia 520 but figured for once I'd splurge and see what all the fuss is about on these top tier phones.The first thing I noticed is that the screen is absolutely beautiful. I couldn't get over how clear and lifelike everything looked. Also being able to actually see my phone's screen in the sun was a definite plus haha. OLED is just an awesome technology and I can't wait until TV manufacturers tweak the picture processing a bit. Just a great display.I haven't run benchmarks or anything but everything on the phone is very snappy. Going into the camera, opening/switching apps, playing games, watching movies, etc. all ran smoothly. I didn't notice any warmth or the phone running hot but that probably due to using a case. The call quality was fine and overall I'm really enjoying it.On the down side, I think the phone's a little awkward to hold or picking up from a flat surface. I got this case Galaxy S7 Edge Case, SUPCASE Full-body Rugged Holster Case WITHOUT Built-in Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (2016 Release), Unicorn Beetle PRO Series - Retail Package (Black/Black) and the rubber edges made a world of difference. It's no longer slippery and easy to pick up off of a flat surface. Nothing worse than paying for a phone like this only to drop it while trying to set it up!The only thing I'm hoping is that the battery lasts quite a long time. Not having easy access to it is kind of a bummer. As I just dropped nearly $750 on it and I don't upgrade phones every year I'm hoping it lasts awhile. As much as I really do like this phone I don't think I'll be spending this much on a phone again. The purchase was more to quell my curiosity about these high end phones so I can check that off my bucket list hahaI purchased the phone from Wireless Everything and it arrived brand new in a sealed box with all new components. I popped my SIM card in and I was off to the races. I never purchased an international phone so was a bit nervous but everything went extremely well. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative I would suggest the OnePlus3 or ZTE Axon 7. Very similar specs for 400 smackaroos."
Love it's very nice looking and the camera is outstanding.
"The phone keep freezing ,"
Love my new phone takes amazing pictures battery life is long lasting and works perfectly with straight talk 😊
its arrived and its single sim card not dual that is problem why that's happen ?
Perfect
"Hi WP, Thank you...I love my awesome phone."
"Good, no problems. Its been 4 months."
"I didn't receive the product, I got an empty package."
"My wife loves the phone. No problems with this one and I hope none come about. Other than getting a lemon on the first phone she received, this one seems to be perfect. Samsung is my favorite brand. Love all thier stuff.Amazon is great at helping customers take care of any problems they have with item by ensuring return shipping is easy and refunds are fast."
Thanks for nice and good product
"The cellphone was broken, bad seller"
Amazing
The phone is not working and when i turn it on the screen turns to green color
Outstanding smartphone. I have been using a IPhone 6s and a Galaxy S6 Edge before. This smartphone beats both.
"Just what I want, a perfect gift for my wife"
"Love it, it came with usb adaptor and 110v adaptor!got an European version wich is great for me"
Great phone! My first Samsung and plan to continue with this brand!
"As soon as i got this i have yet to put it down, SUPER FAST, AMAZING SCREEN, its the dream phone i have been waiting for. Easy to transfer my data to the new phone, very thing and light, when i first held it i was like ""omg this thing is super light"" like i would drop it forgetting about the weight of it lol Only thing i was ""eh"" on about getting it was the seal was detached from the box(wasn't broken but the adhesive was rubbed off from shipping/warehouse), and the branding that usually says ""S7 Edge"" on the back is not on this model which i think is a good thing but made me feel for about an hour ""man i got a fake"" but it was not the case at all, it felt like the real deal. I checked the settings and the software is super snappy and easy to use, in the ""about phone"" section of settings it does say model number and the phone type as what it was advertised.PRO:~Amazing screen~Great build~Wireless Charging/Water Resistant(i have tried the water resistance and i say it works, had residue from the stickers and so i ran under tap water and cleaned that right off)(i have yet to try wireless charging yet)NEUTRAL:~Battery(it seems great but at the same time not so great. I woke up at 7am with 100% and then by 8:45am its at 85% so i still great but i feel by the end of the night ill have 10% left or less. I am a heavy user when it comes to my phone)CON:~Charger it comes with is foreign(my seller gave me an adapter with my phone, but i don't know if that's every purchase so be well aware it MAY NOT come with an American Adapter)As far as i can tell that's about it so far, i will update my review when and if anything changes. Yet to test wireless charging but plan on picking one up soon and will add an edit to this."
"It is good phone, came on time. It is not fake. Everything was good but my messanger is not working properly."
The phones features are great. The only thing is that... I've had the phone for a week and not dropped it once. Today the phone cracked when I dropped it... I was sitting on the floor when it slipped from my hand less than a foot up and the entire screen cracked. This material that it's made from is terribly fragile.
Great!
Vera Good!
Goodd nice
"Phone is very sleek. it looks nice and it has a lot of things going for it.- Water Resistance- Amazing and Fast Camera- amazing screen- pretty fast charging- Good Battery- Fast Charging- Fingerprint Scannerand others.but for all of its pro's it has a few Big Faults. The big one for me was how hot the phone got. For just using google Maps, to even playing Pokemon go for a little bit in the park, the phone got so hot I could barely hold on to it. I couldn't even imagine using this with a case on it might melt. Then when the phone detects that it gets too hot then it makes that big beautiful display lowers it brightness to where I can not see in the daylight anymore. I am having a lot of issue with it in the Sun.I have heard of these issues with other Samsung phones. Maybe its just the ones with this certain processor, I am unsure if the SnapDragon ones have this issues but the reason I got the international is that it could go to any carrier more or less and I could get the added performance of the Exynos Processor. Turns out it was a bad idea and the phone got so unreasonably hot that I could barely hold on to it. The phone also got noticeably slower as it got hotter. Probably because the processor was limiting itself.Maybe this could be fixed with a software update but I think this is more of a hardware issue. Maybe I just got unlucky and got a defective phone as i don't see many other people mentioning these problems. I do not blame Samsung or have any bad feelings for them. I just got unlucky with my device and will be returning it to Amazon."
"5 stars to the phone, 0 stars to ATT. ATT was not able to get 4G connection going on this phone. Blamed hardware. IMEI checked good. Phone would show 4G AP but could not establish data connection with it. Was only working with 3G AP at 3G speed.The thing that did the trick was temporarily inserting SIM card from friend's phone that was connecting 4G. My phone made 4G connection right away. Means hardware is good. Put back my own SIM card. Voila, phone still connects at 4G!"
"nice product, easy to use, but both front and back crack very easily."
Everything perfect
Great product! Got the Italian version. Doesn't seem to be any different. Good battery life.
"Works perfect with the Brazilians (GSM) carriers. Nice and solid finishing. Noticeable improvement from version S6 (I have one). I wish it was for two SIMs, but's ok."
"EDIT: So after owning this for a few months, I'm dropping the rating solely because of the Edge touch screen. The fact is that I find it very annoying to use. The side of your hand touches it really easily, and it it makes typing or playing games on the phone very frustrating. The edge apps themselves are very few and far between and not that useful either. It's a pity since the phone itself is great, runs programs well, has great visuals and camera but actually using the thing is just frustrating. I'd suggest getting just the S7 to save yourself some money and comfort.The phone that arrived is the genuine article and works great--I'm thrilled with how well the battery and fast charging works even when playing Pokemon Go all the time. Also, I have T-Mobile and the phone works perfectly fine.However, even though the app is on your phone, the international model is not compatible with Samsung Pay. If you want that you need to get the American version of the phone. I wish I'd known this, but to me it was worth the savings in price and you can still use Android Pay. But I didn't realize this before buying it and I would have liked to have known."
"After a few hours of use,unexpectly turned off,then it begins lagging and acting weird,just talk to amazon for help, they didn't help me because it was bought through a freight forwarder.i really feel like a wasted my savings for nothing"
The cellphone is not unlocked like the wibsite describes. The cwllphone is locked by T-Mobile carrier

"I live in the UK, but had this delivered to a friend's address while I completed a road trip from Miami to San Francisco. The delivered product was well packaged and was originally intended for the Middle East market. A big bonus for me is that the supplied charger uses a UK-style 3-pin plug. While hardly a big deal as I, like most people, have the world's supply of USB power adapters. Considering that this purchase has saved me quite a bit of cash over outright purchase in the UK, I'm very happy.Powering up the phone for the first time shows a single application for the intended market which was deleted as I have no use for it. I've owned Android phones previously, but have been using an iPhone 6 Plus for the last year. I've since fallen out of love with iOS as it's just too inflexible and is becoming somewhat childish in terms of interface. Samsung's implementation of the Android platform is smooth, highly-polished and commendable. It's not as fast as the pure product in the Nexus lineup, but does not suffer as all as a result.The octacore processor in the non-US model is just pure sweeping power. It's a good thing that the battery is a hefty 3500mAh unit or it wouldn't last the day. That said, if you're the kind of user who has multiple applications running all day long - and I'm among that userbase - this phone will take it all in its stride and not break a sweat. The screen is absolutely beautiful without being too highly saturated, the cameras (both front and back) are immensely capable and the return of expandable storage through cheap and capacious micro-SD cards is very welcome.Physically, the phone is svelte, lightweight and sits in the hand beautifully. Even without a case, there's no feeling that you'll drop it at any moment. One of the finest physical features is the waterproofing that doesn't require that you slap chunks of rubber into the ports to maintain its integrity. no more panics when you're caught in that torrential downpour about your phone suffering a premature demise.I haven't tried any of the included accessories such as the micro-USB cable, charger or earbuds as I already have very high quality 3rd-party versions. From the look of them, they appear to be reasonable quality.For anyone in the US who's concerned about losing out on network connectivity by using a phone from an overseas market, rest assured. I used a SIM card linked to T-Mobile's 4G network and had absolutely no issue anywhere with obtaining a good strong 4G signal. The Exynos processor in the US market model, while likely perfectly adequate, will almost certainly be that touch slower than the beast in the overseas market product.If you're like me, fear running out of power when you're away out all day and carry a power bank, know that the quick charge 2 feature has this from about 5% to fully charged in around an hour. The genuine Samsung quick charge puck may be slower to re-add the juice, but it's utterly convenient when you're a tired and then don't have to worry about not quite plugging the phone in to charge.If you're seeking to buy a phone without the burden of a contract, do yourself a big favour: Save some money, get this model, use one of the probably five or six wall chargers you already have and enjoy this incredible handset. It may be coming from outside of the US, but it's delivered quickly and I have no doubt whatsoever that it'll be loved every bit as I love mine. This is the best phone I've ever had, and the added bonus of saving on the cost of purchasing outright through Best Buy, etc is the icing on an already very delicious cake."
Got horizontal lines on display within few days of usage. Unable to return it because the timeline to return has expired :(
perfect
excellent
"The phone is amazing! the screen is simply the best on the market right now. I read different comments about unreliable sellers selling fake or refurbished phones. I was lucky I bought mine from seller, theCoos. Got the phone new as described without problem."
"AWESOME phone. Came prepackaged, sealed, Turned on in English. There was an Arabic file of some sort - which I deleted. The model number matches correctly. No issues or problems getting it going and activated. Took it to my local AT&T store for the sim card and it took a little extra time and a couple of restarts, but after that everything is working great. I'm still learning some of the little tricks that come with it. The cell coverage shows ""4G"", not ""4GLTE"". I don't know the difference. The ATT guy said some would say it was better, LOL. I have no idea but, whatever. There are a few pre-installed samsung/google things. Smart Switch uploaded many things, but some things like ringtones were not backed up. I had to go looking for them. In the process, I also discovered some new ones. Battery is doing just fine and lasts as expected. It has it's own Samsung factory warranty - 1 year. I haven't been able to find any way to tell for sure if this is the snapdragon or xynos processor, but as I stated earlier, the model number matches, so....my first experience with an unlocked phone purchase on Amazon has gone well, IMHO. Thus far."
"The Samsung Galaxy S7 is perhaps the best mobile device right now. With so much technology, it has boosted the Galaxy S series. It is very easy to use and it makes you feel as if you don't have a mobile, instead you have so much more."
do not have samsung pay for international version. which is the main reason why I select samsung.
Device works fine and is fully unlocked and shipped in two days. All around good service
I'm kind of afraid that I wasted my money buying this considering all of the negative reviewsi just read. I surely hope that it works out when I receive it
Good
I didn't like the fact that the phone came with a charger that can't be used because it doesn't have the prongs for this country and all instructions were in another language
"I paid for a new phone, but the phone I received was already set up and displays 7 voicemails from the 19th of April thru the 13th of May, and the plastic film was put back on upside down. WTH! Sadly not only are they thieves, but they are incompetent thieves!"
"Liked a lot the device. Only thing that came with very low, cheap quality was the AC adaptert. Look like the one you buy in grocery shop at half dollar. All accesories came within sealed box (headphones, sim remover, usb adapter, charger, device, etc)"
"Excellent and awesome phone! I think I won't upgrade this phone 2 years 'cuz it has everything! micro SD, OUTSTANDING battery! water and dust resistance and AMAZING and colorful screen! and flawless performance! It's just magnificent!"
Not sure why the reception is so weak Bad antenna ?
"Hands down the best cell phone I have ever owned. I have a iPhone 6 for work which I love, but this S7 beats it by a mile. Battery life is outstanding unlike so many Android phones, and the display and camera are top notch. I like this international version with the non-US processor and it seems to be getting better battery life than the Snapdragon processor for the domestic market. Either version though is still the best on the market."
The Q&A said this comes with a US power adapter. Mine did not. I got the German pin-type power connector without any adapters for the US.
Excelente
This cell phone is so pretty，I love the edge！But sometimes it will overheat.
"Love my phone, but I wish they came out with a bigger internal memory. Can't store the downloaded Amazon Videos on the external memory. So I can only keep a few movies then delete them after watching it. I don't want to steam videos or it will eat my data, and I'm not at a Wi-Fi hotspot all the time. That so far is the downside. Also, my phone did freeze once, but I was able to hard boot it by holding down the power button and the volume up and down button at the same time for a few seconds."
"I'm not one who generally uses my phone. I'm a pay-as-you-go type of person. I use my phone for calls and texts. I see no need to pay extra for internet with the number of places with free wifi. My last phone was the Samsung Gravity, so this was a large step for me. For my needs, this phone is extremely oversized... with that being said, the display size makes it great for other things. I try to use my phone minimally. I use apps for the weather because I own a convertible and love the beach. I also chat with some friends using LINE. I was holding out for the 64GB version, but didn't see any availability for it and needed the phone for work... so I can download and read email... and chat using Lync/Skype.PROS- 12 MP camera for nice crisp pics.- excellent display for viewing photos and movies- extremely fast and smooth opening and switching apps. I notice no lag whatsoever.- expandable storage- battery can last me two daysCONS- size- easy to accidentally press button on sides- internal memory options for the U.S.- color choices by cell phone carrierIf there is one regret, it's that I wish I had bought the dual sim version just in case I wanted two carriers so I can maintain my grandfathered price plan and still pay separately for wifi should I ever need it."
Excelent all
"Exynos processor. ISOCELL camera sensor. No Carrier bloatware. Suspiciously missing the Galaxy S7 Edge logo on the back shown in the photo. Aida64 shows the correct info, though.I've used the phone for over a week, now. I'm very happy with it. Still getting used to some aspects of the interface, but what it does, it does incredibly quickly. No lag in anything. Samsung has some nice features included. I love the health suite. I love the battery life.Cons: the duplicate apps. I want the ability to remove the browser, email app, etc. Things that I don't use. Things that Google also includes. Can't uninstall those either, surprisingly. Also, the whole Edge thing... There aren't enough ways to customize it or the edge notifications which display with the always on display. Also, the built-in so to transfer app data from your old phone didn't work with my HTC One."
I have been using this phone for three days now. I was impressed that the phone was delivered sooner than expected. The box was sealed and everything was intact. My only problem is that this phone came with a plug you use in Europe and where I live we use the plugs used in the US. Not a big problem since I can charge the phone with other chargers. I bought the international version since I read that the Exynos chip is better than Snapdragon. I previously used a Samsung S3 which recently died and it wasn't a difficult transition. I also have a P8 Lite which in my opinion takes better selfies. I'd still buy the S7 edge again though. The phone is very fast. Battery life is exceptional. I have only charged it once so far and it still has 52% of battery life left! I also love that the phone is very loud. The phone fits easily in my small hands and is pretty light. I also love being able to unlock the phone with my fingerprint. I also love that the speaker is very loud. For someone who's hard of hearing like me that is a plus!
"Less than ONE MONTH after I purchased this, it's gone wonky...randomly restarting even when I'm not using it, freezing then re-starting when I AM using it...I LOVE the S7 Edge, but I knew buying on Amazon was a BAD IDEA.If there's any way to exchange this item without having to go without a phone for a week, I want to exchange it...but I work from my phone and this is a real crap-storm right now."
"The device is a 100% win. The only aspect that I didn't really understand is that at the back of the phone it doesn't say ""Galaxy s7 edge"". Other than that it's a pretty awesome deal."
"I have received my Samsung Galaxy S7 G935F satisfactorily, NGP Store you are the Best! Thank you for the order. I will have present you for make more purchases in the future."
"The phone that was sold to me as unlocked is asking for a network unlock code.... this is BS, the phone is not actually unlocked. Wireless Everything is not telling the truth about this. If I don't receive any contact I can only conclude that I was taken to the cleaners and my money is down the rat hole."
"For reference, my previous phones were not flagship phones but rather they call under the budget/mid-range smartphone category. This may skew my review a bit since I'm going from mid range to flagship, but I think the Galaxy S7 Edge has so much going for it that it doesn't matter too much about my previous reviews.PREVIOUS PHONESNexus 5, OnePlus One, OnePlus Two, Nexus 5x, Honor 5xDESIGNThis phone is beautiful. Honestly, I love looking at this phone and I find myself wiping down the phone to maintain it's reflective silver reflection. In the day and age of large phones, the Galaxy S7 edge finds the perfect size.(To Be Continued. I'm writing this on my lunch break)SUPER AMOLED DISPLAYThe display on thisPERFORMANCECAMERABATTERY LIFE IS FOREVERWATERPROOFINGFINGERPRINT READERIf I had to fault this phone for anything, it would be the fingerprint reader. For some reason, my phone doesn't always recongnize my fingerprints. I've reset them a couple times and it still doesn't always read it correctly. My last three phones had fingerprint readers and they were all quicker or more accurate than the S7 Edge. I suspect that it's because the home button is very short (height-wise) and that the home button is raised.FEATURES FEATURES FEATURES"
Good.. thanks...
"This is a great phone! screen, design, camera, you won't have complains. Except that there are options almost as good as that for a lot less money."
except samsung pay everything is good
"Buyers Be AwareThis shipper has send me 'FAKE"" Samsung cell phone.Everything looks almost similar to the original Samsung but many features do not work especially the Camera makes terrible low pixel pictures, no screen stability, always lagging behind and many more.... buyers be aware.Although I send it back immediately, I am still working to get my money back."
just what I was looking for
Best phone I've ever bought!
It was to expensive. And it does not get fully charged in 4 hours and it does not stay charged more than 12 hours. I like my LG flex better.
Excellent product!!!!
It was good
I LIKE PHONE PROBABLY MORE THAN ANY I HAD SO FAR ESPECIALLY CAMERA AND IT FUNCTIONS GOOD SO FAR'
Very good
Everything was ok the phone is great :)
The best smartphone.I feel like a baby with new toy.

good
Best cell phone ever. *****
"It's an awesome phone. The edge takes a little getting used to, but that's a small issue. Great camera, awesome sound in music and talking. Love the anti-glare. Seriously no glare from any angle. Even the headphones were great. Clear, crisp sounds. I bought the unlocked version and it works perfectly. Just had to insert the sim card and that was it. (And that's in the Caribbean) so for those customers wandering, it's definitely an Unlocked International Version. Highly recommended."
Over heating
This is a fantastic device. Works well in my country and costs $350 less than in my country. I know you won't believe it but it is a sad fact.
Great phone! Everything I use so far is good.Unblocked version it's so better than cell comapnies version because you save a lot of time non uninstalling app that you'll never use
The screen broke the first time I tried to use it.
A complete garbage! ! ! Don't buy it! You will lose a big amount of money! . After 2 month the screen became complete black. I contacted the seller and he said that the warranty with them was just for one month but he told me that I had one year of warranty with Samsung. .... I tried to contact to Samsung warranty in United States and in my country (Argentina ) and they both said that the year of warranty was only with the country where the phone was manufactured (Vietnam. ....seriously? ??)Well I wasted almost uss 700 in a phone that after 2 months stopped working and the only solution that I have gotten was to fly to Vietnam or spend uss 330 more tax to fix it in a no official cellphone center of technical support
I love my new cel phone.Fer
perfect
Excelente
"Everything is good. Would be amazing, if my microphone worked though. Supermely annoying I can't make calls. Would have gotten a 5 star but because of this problem UT gets one"
OK
too much advertisement and getting hot too past.
Perfect
I hope this one can use a long time.....
"Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G935F- Black OynxAbsolutely disappointing, the charging port was hurt at 4 days, and today after 10 days has begun to smoke and smell of burning. I'll have to repair the ""new"" cell. I'm angry and I'll never buy in this shop."
"It is perfect this phone . First time that I bought a phone online and I had a very good experience . It's in very good condition and I got the phone next day . The only thing it's that on the back doesn't say ""galaxy s7 edge"""
"Bought this phone and have had it for several weeks. Absolutely love it ! fast and smooth, battery life is amazing. I'm with AT&T and if you can sacrifice wifi calling... this is the way to go. although it doesn't have all the LTE bands I have absolutely no trouble. My job requires me to travel often and I get great coverage everywhere, even in the gulf of mexico. I am now an exynos s7 edge fan boy."
Excelente Producto. Vendedor Recomendable
"if u have tmobile by this with confidence I was very hesitant at first people saying this is designed for a different region, until i remembered that I am middle eastern and the phone I previously bought was designed for middle east and worked great here in the US until I decided to upgrade, the only difference you will notice is the pre installed apps for the region and that chargers may have different inputs because it was designed for Europe or middle east, my seller that i bought from solved the charger issue by providing a complementary connectorgo for it, be brave for once."
"Everything went well, excelent product. Hope do not explode!"
i love my galaxy s7 i have no words
Excelent smartphone
The speaker does not work. The headset is not heard for calls. Does not emit any sounds. Try updating firmware. Clean the terminal. But unfortunately it is the hard. Is a beautiful and expensive paperweight. It has no international guarantee. The phone is from the Saudi Arabia region.
"It was perfect for a month until just yesterday, it suddenly crashed while I was using it and will no longer properly boot up. Going to try calling Samsung for servicing tomorrow, hopefully the warranty works.**Edit update 11/19: Samsung said that their US warranty does not cover for international versions and fixing it myself did not work. Luckily, I called Amazon and they very kindly allowed me to return the phone for a full refund! If you are facing the same problem you might want to try this asap!"
Good value for the money
It's good so far
The rear glass is broken. The headphone does not work. I guess that's why it's cheap.
"Phone arrived OK it functioned fine. After one month problems started. Phone constantly reboots. Some times gets stuck, no hard reset is possible, only need to wait for battery to die. Next thing phone died altogether. There is no warranty from the shipper TheCoos !!!. Now I am stuck with this brick and do not know how to fix it. I did not expect such a poor performance from a supposedly top of the line phone. Maybe this ""International version"" is fishy. I strongly advise: Do not buy this phone!!!."
The product start to have problems with the screen and the vendor dosen't have any to say about that
"I like the S7 Edge a lot. Very sold phone, good battery life. Nice looks."
Works great! excelent product!
"Beautiful cell phone, light weight, thin, good screen size, lots of functions. As soon I inserted the SIM card it gat connected to my provider. Its working fine"
"International phones can not be repaired in the US. Despite the cost of this phone, it is a piece of crap. Samsung customer support will not help. LCD problem in less than 3 months with minimal use, and NO damage. Not even a scratch on the phone, yet it is almost useless. There are smart phones selling for $10.00. This one cost me $850.00 and did not last long. BUYER BEWARE."
"Excellent! Great design, smart, camera is wonderful even in the night time with bad light. Sensitive screen, fast internet... no problem. Thank you.Delivery in time."
ok
thanks very good
Perfect!!
All that I expected
"I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 and am absolutely Amazed by this phone. It can go for over two days before charging. It has none of the typical bloatware. It's supposedly waterproof but I don't plan on testing that on purpose. It's painful to have to pay the full price up front but it's worth it to not be at the mercy of your cell phone provider. I will never buy a locked cell phone from a cell phone provider again. I'm glad they brought back the SD memory slot, but I wish it had a removable battery. Other than that, I think the Galaxy S7 is one of the best phones on the market at this time."
"Excellent phone, I just wish it had all the band's of the phones so you can switch to any carrier like the nexus phones, and Samsung pay wish it had but I know because it's international it couldn't, but we'll made. :)"
Have had the phone for a month and just love it.
"I bought this phone in August for my wife, the phone has been a hassle from the get go. Two weeks after purchase the volume button started moving erratically on its own. Then the phone started hanging and will not reset by just switching off the phone, we need to hold the power button and the decrease volume button at the same time. The frequency of hanging just kept increasing, even after the doing a factory reset the phone continued to deteriorate. I am highly disappointed! I would have returned the phone if the window had not elapsed. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"
"Excelente Product!! No objections, just get a antislip case cause is like silk"
Its a bad experiencie because I Lost almost $120
Good item.
FRAUD!!!... Phone is from Brazil and does not work.
ok
ok
good every thing
"great deal, great seller!"
it is an excellent cellphone
very good
"Did not come with charger adapter as expected, otherwise its PERFECT"
Fast delivery. Product awesome.
The mother board came broken and I cant do anything
"It's a great phone, i recomend!"
Cost-effective.Product delivered exactly as advertised.
No stars if I could I got a GS7 no edge
"I'm really pleased with the product,Met my expectations and the information provided by the seller is correct as the photos.I really recommend the product because for me it was very useful.I hope my comments were helpful"
I dislike this product is not working good
"Great display, good battery life"
"I purchased this phone for the expressed purpose of developing VR projects for Gear VR and Google Cardboard. I never expected or intended to use the phone features of the device. So I never added a SIM card much less carried it around or away from my office. After a couple of weeks the OS seemed to have crapped out and got itself stuck on some green terminal looking boot screen. Despite all my attempts to force a restart, perform a system restore, drain/charge the battery or whatever Android lets you do by holding in button X while closing one eye and whistling a happy tune, the phone just won't get past that Bootloader exception screen.I'm not an Android guy and since the purpose of the phone was to test apps, the device was required to be as close to stock as possible to adequately replicate the experience someone might have on their own device. By that I mean I didn't ""root"" the phone or mess with the OS beyond letting Android run all those auto updates it seems to do on a daily basis.I contacted Samsung US support and they said my phone didn't exist as far as they were concerned because it was obviously an international device. They told me to determine the country of origin and arrange service there.How convenient.I looked for some type of local resource that can service phones but it appears all that can be done are screen or battery replacements. Anything heavier has to go to the manufacturer...in Spain...or Antartica...or the Moon.I contacted the Amazon Marketplace vendor (Mobiles International LLC) that I purchased the phone from and they we nice enough in their correspondence and said:""Unfortunately Samsung does not provide warranty service on international unlocked phones. If you sent it to us in Miami, we can get a quote from a Samsung authorized service center to get the phone repaired. It looks like a software issue and should be fixable.""I FedEx'd them the phone and waited and waited. After two weeks or so I sent them an email wondering if there was any update.""At this time we have not received a quote unfortunately, the Samsung repair center here cannot repair your device because it is not Latin. We have one other option that we are trying. We will contact you as soon as we get a response.""And waited and waited...till about a month and half had passed and got this:""We received the unit back from Samsung this week. They returned the unit saying the warranty was void. We have shipped back to your address yesterday.""Huh? Is Samsung saying that I dropped it in a toilet? Or that I used my considerable phone hacking skills to circumvent their awesome software and install my own custom OS? No idea.So the lesson being, read the fine print. International unlocked phones may or may NOT come with a warranty. And even if you work yourself past that little detail and decide to roll the dice...if something goes wrong with your device there appears to be no recourse to have it repaired.Even if you expect to pay for said repair because the assumption being that a repair would cost less than the cost of a new phone there doesn't seem to be any reasonable way to facilitate getting it fixed. Waiting weeks and weeks to get some vague note about the warranty being void is hardly a workable solution."
announcer says that phone waterproof . He entered the water to photograph and phone filled with water and stopped working.
Love the phone but the front glass cracked within the first month with no foreseeable way of having ii repaired for much less than the cost of a new phone.
Best phone I ever had. Period.
Love it
I love it. It's beautiful
I didn't even download one app and the phone started heating up to the point that I couldn't touch the sides of the phone. I reset it twice and the phone was leggy as if it was an s2. I'm getting another one and after that one doesn't work which it obviously won't seeing that this crappie one almost melted I'm reporting them as frauds.
Best phone ever u till the note 7
I love it
The cel phone came with a burned pixel that didnt fix... the rest was ok
Best
"Amazing phone, super fast and terrific camera"
"Incredible Smartphone. Every single detail you must want ina phone, it comes with it."
It's Samsung! :)
Very good
There is a mark on screen from the day it came and there is lot of heating issue with phone
"The phone was unlocked but was formerly a Sprint serviced phone. It turned out to be a stolen product and Sprint was able to disable the voice and messaging functions. However Amazon did back it up with a refund for me. Next, I bought the same phone but used, not refurbished, with a different service provider, thru Amazon. It has my carrier on it (t-mobile) and have had no issues with it. It is also unlocked.Great camera. Except it gets fuzzy at max zoom."
Excelente. Recomendamos
I Bought this phone as a gift for my sister and brother in Europe. The phones arrived in brand new condition with seal and in a timely manner. They absolutely love the Samsung over their previous phones( iPhone6). They have stated the phone is absolutely amazing and beautiful. It works wonderfully for their purpose and the quality is good. Watching videos look great and the photo quality is gorgeous. They are happy with the expansive memory.
Satisfied.
Package was not damaged and I loved the box of the phone. Appearance mean everything and the seller passed with that.
"Great Phone, great price, recieved Phone on time as promised. Thank you."
"this is the best cell phone I have. The size is almost the same as Samsung S5, except the format edge give us a very pleasant touch and view! The camera is exceptional, have auto focus and it is impossible to have bad pictures. The only problem is that it is so sensitive that a single harder touch can become multiple pictures..This is definitely the BEST SAMSUNG S series phone, and if the money is not the problem, forget the S7 and go to the S7 Edge!!!"
Great product so far..
S7 edge is the best
So far no!!!!!! I ordered the Samsung galaxy s7 EDGE GOLD and received the regular s7 in silver like wtf
"Very good phone. It's an international version, with adapter."
Excellent
Excelent!!
Excelente gracias
"Mailed out fast! Got it a day early! So glad i got the international version! And there is 4 reasons why.....Reason 1 - NOT FILLED WITH A TON OF BLOATWARE! No At&t crap apps. It does have a few like facebook and instagram. But most people use them and other than that just disable it....Reason 2 - Because it's the international version... We have the GALAXY LAB! Where you can get the app draw remove! which I enjoy. American Carriers Took it out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Reason 3 - Paying full price, I am not stuck in a contract for 2 years where the bill doesn't lower after the 2 years are up. OR not stuck in a monthly contract paying off the phone paying interest.Reason 4 - I HAVE NO STUPID CARRIER LOGO ON MY PHONE!!!! Such an EYE SORE and aggravation for a company to put there logo on another companies devise thats is sold off to the consumer.... its s***ty graffiti."
great phone
Awesome phone....
As advertised
Very good phone
The screen times out while I am using the phone. And my low light camera isn't functioning properly.
"Excellent product I love it. No regret for price paid, it really worth it."
I like it nothing was wrong with my phone the seal wasn't broken it the real Samsung galaxy s7 edge not fake so thanks
Amazing phone from a hardworking seller. Thanks!
Ok
Switched from an iPhone 5 and so glad I did. This is an amazing phone!
Good products
Excellent
Love it
The charger which was sent with the phone does not apply to the USA setting.it is really giving me a hard time to charge and I also expected the phone to come with a memory card but it does not have one.
Everything as should be... would buy from them again
nice phone very good
"Amazing phone. Bought it to use it in Argentina, 4G works perfectly. Packaging was inmaculate."
"Love Love Love this phone. The screen is crisper than anything I have seen, it's fast and beautiful. Life is good"
All excellent
Excelente
Loved!
Best Galaxy ever. Amazing.
"Updating my review. I specifically ordered the LATAM version as I work in South America. Constant connection drops and errors on my home network in Peru (Claro). Claro has replaced my SIM twice and the problems still arise. Couldn't connect in Ecuador on a standard GSM network that my S5 had connected to for years. Guatemala, couldn't hold a connection either that my S5 had used for years as well. I have a $700 top of the line network only device. Thankfully I still have my S5. I would not trust this seller to send you the specific version you need for your region."
"Dropped once, front and back completely shattered, >300$ repair costNot only did the front and back glass spiderweb after a single drop, the phone itself started glitching and now it won't even turn on. Apparently dropping it voids the warranty so now I have a 600$ paperweight. This will be my final Samsung phone."
Good.
Yes. Everything was perfect . Thanks
Birthday gift for my brother. He loved it too death.
"so far so good,loving the phone,genuine and clean"
I got this phone and it was not working properly. I called and spoke with a representative and he stated he would send out another phone but never did and I waited a week then had to call back and get another phone. The screen stopped working.
"Good phone, nice design as almost everyone would agree. But it is very fragile! I drop mine from 2-3 feet high and got the screen edge shattered."
Wonderful
Good product
I love it
Love it. Using it with MetroPCS.
Amazing
very fantastic am really enjoying the it
Excellent!
"I wouldn't recommend buying it online, the phone I got came good but then started acting weird. When I would send out pictures it would not send. Another thing is that when i plug in my earbuds they only work on one side. I checked with many other earbuds and its still the same side, so therefore the phone is defected. The warranty isn't good as well, they would not provide you with a replacement phone while they have it for repairs. Me as a business owner, I can't go without my phone over 12 hours."
Very happy with the purchase.
"I will never again buy a phone through a cell service provider. Buying unlocked through Amazon or some other reputable source saves you about 20%, and here's the really great part: no bloatware! Be careful to ensure that the phone will work with your service provider, but if it will this is the way to go without a doubt."
Awesome phone!
Good
"I use StraightTalk with this phone. It took no more than an hour to transfer my phone number to this phone, and I had exactly 0 issues with it since. If you want a brand new unlocked phone, I would recommend no further than this. It did come with some sort of foreign software, and Facebook and Instagram seem to be installed and non-removable, but they were trivial to disable."
good
"Easily the best phone I've owned. Period. Great battery life compared with my last 3 phones (xperia Z2/Note 4/LG G4) Extremely fast, reliable, easily manages all my applications (55), great camera, waterproof.. And on and on... Great phone.. Really worth the price. Chose it over the S7 due screen size and battery life expectancy."
no 4G LTE .. Wireless PLACE..w
Those black lines showed up from no where. I don't know what is the problem . I would like to get an exchange please
I'like. Good product.
It's not working. I need new one Tuesday. Wednesday I'm going back to Turkey. If I can't get one till Tuesday it doesn't matter what I liked or disliked about this
"Be careful , It comes with UK Plug ."
"Excellent screen, fast, good battery life, has met my expectations."
"Good seller, product as per description."
"First of all this phone did not have DUAL SIM, but that is the seller's fault for the bad description. However the screen quickly shattered even with a protector on and without even dropping it. Something just bumped my leg and it was done. Screen replacement is very high as well. not having airdrop and imessage really takes away ease of use."
"Perfect service, Quick delivery, Great product.Thanks!"
Cracked after 4 months. Great phone but very easy to break
"Phone was already opened when I received it. Factory seal was broken and a cheap white sticker stuck over it to make it look like it was sealed, but the original broken seal was still underneath. The protective cover had also been removed because it wasn't on straight and there were bubbles and lint under it. Factory unlocked means unlocked from the factory, there should have been no reason for anyone to have opened it to unlock it as it said it came that way from the factory. Good part was returning it to Amazon was very easy, though I had to wait several days to get the $ back on my credit card to be able to buy another phone."
IT stopped working after 1 day. Major disappointing
This phone stopped working after 3 months. It reboots the on its own and freezes constantly.
"*** FRAUD *** I ORDERED THIS FROM ""BEST PRICE MOBILE"" AND RECEIVED A DUMMY PHONE NO USB CABLE *** JUST A PLASTIC DUMMY PHONE GAMESTOP CHARGER AND ARAB MANUALS *** BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!!! *** FILED FRAUD COMPLAINT WITH AMAZON"
"Phone works well for two months. Then the display turned off. I tryed to get support from Samsung, and they said is an International version, it has not warranty in the US. Needs to be sent to Australia for warranty service. Very ugly experience"
All ok
Unrepairable in USA
ExcellentI bought it for a friend he got it today and is very very happy with his gift
Very nice product.
"so far is amazing, fast, awesome screen. I haven't try the unlocked since I need new Sim card, now it uses the nano simple card, but I'm expecting to work."
"I'm a bit disappointed with my shipment. Only got European socket charger but no american charger or adapter like people say they got on other reviews. Also seal of packaging was already broken! And also packaging was kind of workn. Still phone looks great, bummer I will have to get a proper charger before using it! To nake things worse now phone is almost 10 dollars cheaper than when I bought few days ago."
great value product!
Awesome phone. Would recommend it highly
This phone works perfectly thus far.. I'm loving it!!
thank you for my phone
Only head the phone a few days and already it has glitches. The volume will randomly turn itself back on from vibrate without anyone even touching the device and also the power button sometimes woulnt work
Great phone but charger was not original everything else it great
Phone that I have received was broken. Whenever I take a picture under any kind of artificial light I get bright yellow/orange spot at the center which also shows up in pictures.
Optimo!
At first I gave this 5 stars. Now I'm giving it one because it has a vertical pink line going up and down the phone. I spent a crap load of money on this phone for it to be doing this. I will give it 5 stars again once the problem is fixed or phone is replaced
A+
"I have been a Samsung Galaxy owner before, but decided to make a change to a phone that started good then got worst.I used to own the s3 and I'm glad I made a comeback to Samsung once again.The international version seems to be faster and have a longer battery life than the last phone I used to own. With one charge it'll last me all day, while on the other phone I had to recharged it when I got home from work.The graphics are amazing and I haven't had any glitches or problems with the phone so far.I did buy a screen protector and phone case since I seem to break phones quite easy.The screen itself seems to be scratch resistant.As for water resistant I can't say anything since I haven't used my phone in the water, I don't feel confident enough to drop my phone in the water or have it in the shower.This is so far the best phone I've owned, it does not heat up as bad as my other phone and it has an elegant view."
 I Thought that the galaxy S7 edge is the best product but after just one week of use (it was not a massive use because it was my secondary phone) a black lines appeared on the screen when I change the brightness I reset the phone but I noticed it's a hardware issue not a software problem and I found myself unable to do anything because I am leaving the country
Amazing!!!
Beautiful phone
Good phone.
"Great phone and camera. Seems to slow as you load on more apps, but still faster than my S5"
"I was very surprise when I turn on the phone it seems that it was not new because it was already configured, I dont see the first time I turn on de Willkommen screen. It was configures in Dubai. The phone work, Also de charger is very sttrange , very big and with rare conectors.......The phone is very good but Im conserned that you send me something used whe I paid the full price."
"Great phone, though can be very buggy at times."
The phone is solid but I can't stand the edges. I ended up going back to the Note 5
"It seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves, who break the phone's box seal, open the box, and unlock the phones themselves (note that Samsung says ""do not accept if seal is broken""). Hence, technically, most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new. I bought a lot of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phones from Amazon, and most (not all) had the seal broken.On the phone itself, interestingly, the S7 Edge feels lighter than the S7 (even though it is 3% heavier ... maybe because the weight is distributed differently). The bigger screen is good for people with vision issues, but the resolution is the same as with the S7. The edges are highly annoying, making one touch them by mistake constantly. Furthermore, the edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case. I do not like this phone. I love the regular S7."
I received a wrong version...
The best Phone
"I'm so upset the phone keeps freezing and it just jumps from one app to the next without me selecting anything. Sometimes it don't allow me to restart it or turn it off. It also restart by itself sometimes, I'm very disappointed having me thinking if it's a refurbished phone."
Has lots of cool and helpful features. Performance is very good. I highly recommend purchase if you are considering switching or upgrading
I received the wrong power plug. Did not get the US type.
This phone is absolutely stellar. Amazing screen even in direct sunlight. Battery life is tremendous. The ONLY drawback is this version isn't compatible with Samsung Pay at this time in the US.
"Awesome phone and amazing camera I mean this is the camera to beat. S7 edge due to the bigger battery almost has 2 day battery life, touch wiz has been heavily refined, but nova is still the way to go. Design is slick and still a head turner and feels great in the hand. Number 1 of the top 3 Android phones , and I highly recommend only con is no Samsung Pay for international."
I'm satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy s7 EdgeIt's very good product beautiful. I truly loved.
"Buying this unlocked international Galaxy S7 Edge had me worried at first, it was in Spanish when I turned it on. You need to have your sim card inserted before you can change the language! After getting it to English I am totally please with it. I had the Galaxy S5, and compared to that phone, this Galaxy S7 Edge is AMAZING! There are so my new and cool features. I took 4 days to receive the phone. I'm totally satisfied with this purchase."
Love it. Exynos processor is much faster than us versionAlso I travel a lot to Mexico so be able to switch SIM cards is awesome
Excellent vendor. Product is exact as described. All Perfect.Recommend to all.
Great service. No issues .
Excelente
Rather expensive but meet all your expectations
Increíble! Gracias!
Fantastic
I rate this as a 100 % not a fake fun everything is fully clean
"the phone was good, the packaging was terrible"
Do not like it very much
Great phone. I just love it
Nice seller and excellent product.
Good phone

so much better than getting the ATT version of the phone no bloat ware and you can teather with out having to buy the extra service from ATT
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CJU9BBM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
Legit Company. The phone is brand new no issues... & these guys are fast!!!
Great
I have it for a about a year and works great!
"Screen failed in under 4 months. No warranty, no repairs. You are paying for a future $600 brick."
Works with American AT&T no problems. The 4g lte symbol does not show up but I know I get the speeds. Very happy that I purchased it
"Love this phone so far. It has been reliable and works as advertised. This is the international version, which means certain apps, like Samsung Pay, don't work. It's only come up a couple of times, but it is annoying. Not a negative on the phone, it's clear that this is the case. Just wanted to spread awareness."
"do not buy a international phone some features will not work,,,,,,,,, This seller is slow on returns"
"Good product, but a little defect. The home button make big noise when pressing it."
Thanks very good
Great product.... great seller
It said the phone was unlocked and I can't even use it with Verizon very upset
beautiful good
Perfecto
Good
beautiful and fast
"This phone is the best and has no problem, it works perfectly in Ecuador."
I am a bit concerned about the battery I was expecting it to last longer than it does
This is the first phone I've had that didn't annoy me with its sluggishness. Battery lasts a long time.
I got what I was expecting. Thanks
All is great
"Everithing it's ok, the cell phone is amazing."
Because I think it is the best to have
great
"1) Great phone. Works as expected.2) Giving 5 stars for the great customer support, helped me to solve my issue really fast."
"Excellent product, it did came unlocked as mentioned with no trash applications pre-installed. It comes in the sealed Samsung box and comes with charger adaptor for America since it comes with a different charger for European wall plugs."
Amazing phone. Completely satisfied.
everything is perfect except the battery that doesn t last a complete day...
Exelente
Best phone I've ever owned!
got the phone works great
Shipped very fast.Great phone.The only thing i'm not satisfied is my unit have that so called front facing camera out of focus. I wonder if I can ask for a replacement for this and how long is the return/replacement window for this item. It would be very nice if this can be addressed. Thank you.
Love it!
Wow I love this phone and it was shipped the the very next day I ordered it.
My best phone ever.
amazing
Like it
"First of all, this product came delayed in shipping. One week late to be exact.Second, the cable charger usb that comes with the product is missing a line, slowing down my charging. Another small issue is that the charger plug is big and doesn't fit in most power extension cords.There is also a small heating problem with the phone when using it to play games or for long periods of time.For my personal preferences, I dislike the phone because all the buttons are very sensitive; even the power and volume buttons are sensitive and easy to press on."
Great product won't regret buying.
good excelent.
Amazing one
"Sooo ummm I got it the next day after ordering it, which is crazy. I done my personal testing and I'm really Impressed makes my note 1 feel like a brick.... edited part: I dropped it in a huge puddle today sat for a good 7 mins under water, pulled it out and still works great"
Excellent
good
"Came in perfectly fine, works fine. Is sexy. Yes."
Love the phone I was a little scare at first because some of the paper instructions were in arabic but I put the phone to work without trouble manage to change the settings to english and spanish .It is a great phone charge really fast the adapter came for middle east kind of current but they were kind and send a travel adapter for it works great so far I am really happy thank you.
The phone was working pretty awesome then it just crashed and wouldn't turn on. Did all the troubleshooting I could and it still wouldn't turn on. So I had to return item.
"Excellent product, it cover al my expectations and more. The seller has a great attention."
"I am kind of angry to buy this and now I realized what the hack does international version mean. This is an international version which is far inferior to US counterpart. What I got is an Italian version. Some stupid Italian company's apps were pre-installed and cannot uninstall them.1. You cannot use Samsung pay with this version2. CPU is VFPv4 Neon which is far interior to the US version made by Qualcom3. I performed benchmarks with AnTuTu apps: SM-G935F (this model) is very under-performed. especially in graphics score 20781 (this model) vs 33831(Original US version) - this phone is around 35% under-performed than US conterpart.4. As I said, you cannot uninstall some stupid foreign cell-phone company's apps. Starting with foreign languages is a bonus.I hate Samsung to build these variations all the time to fool around the customers. Please check everything possible before you buy the Samsung products. AND buy US version all the time. This would not happen to Iphone which I used right before this one."
Switched from iPhone to this phone. After 1 week...No regrets.
<3 Great phone love it so far.
"I am coming from Note 3. Tried and returned the following phones:Nexus 6 – very poor battery life for massive screen, but overall quite good;Nexus 6P – very bad sound quality (low volume, very low volume), build quality (headphone jack broke in 10 days)I did not want to go with Samsung just for the fact that they do not stand behind their products and make their products obsolete and not supported after 2 years. Not acceptable for me, and my Note 3 still works great even though it is running in KitKat.But anyway, I was getting tired finding a good Android phone. By that time every manufacture has to produce a great phone, which has great OIS camera, good CPU, bright screen and be nice looking with strong materials. But looks like every manufacture is failing to do that. Some have good screens, bad build quality, some just bad battery, or bad internals. I see only Samsung is making something decent I can live with: Great design, strong body, good and stable software and have ability to root.So after multiple tries with others, I decided to go back to Samsung.Let me start with things I do not like about it.1. Edge screen is too sensitive and I think there should be an option to disable edge touch, or make it app specific. Forget about quality typing with one hand. You will always hit backspace or other keys on your right (if you are right-handed) with your palm. Waiting for a case to see if this going to help. This is huge -1 star for this device);2. Home button is still sticking out of the body. Why not to flash it so there are no accidental wake ups while in the pocket or somewhere else?3. Fingerprint is not good. Nexus 6P had the best and was fastest. Here it fails to recognize in a lot of occasions even while trying to set it up. BTW, why only 4 fingerprints can be setup. Why not more? I was setting up the same finger touching with different sides of the finger in case I need to unlock from different angles.Now what I like:1. Screen brightness – great. The best among all the phones on the market;2. Sound quality (music) over headphones and Bluetooth. BUT. Sound quality is not that good using original signal processing. I am very peaky for bass and treble. That is why I was looking for a phone, I can root and install Viper4Android to make phone sound perfect.3. Like headjack on the bottom, now you can slip you phone in the pocket without flipping it over to make headjack on the top while it is in your pocket.4. Completely unlocked phone vs Snapdragon model where bootloader is locked. I installed Custom Recovery, rooted phone, installed Wanam Xposed framework and Viper4Android. These pieces of software is a must for me. Wanam provided me with long press back button to kill process, long press volume keys to switch tracks, remove annoying popup when headset volume is high and some other features. And Viper4Android makes sound like no one else can produce.5. Always On Screen – love it. Does not look like it drains a lot of battery if at all;6. Build quality – gorgeous. Back does not feel glass though. But I am going to put case on it anyway.7. Battery – very easy to make though the day or two. Used it with Navigation and screen ON for 2 hour drive. Battery went down only 15%.8. Taking pictures – very good and I like the fact that it is wide angle. Both front and back camera took very good pictures even indoors, while at the dance competition. Focus is lightning fast.9. Connectivity – very strong and where my Note 3 or Nexus 6P were struggling for LTE signal (AT&T), Galaxy S7 was fine.10. Call quality – it feels like a person is just next to you. Very clear and solid.11. Glad that Samsung did not remove the option to scale screen. Unfortunately they only provide 2 options: Standard and Condensed, but at least something. Nexus 6P gave me more options from 400 dpi to 640 dpi. But I had Cyanogenmod running on Nexus 6P.12. Performance – very fast, no lags at all.13. Google Pay is working on it even I am rooted and have Wanam installed. Made first payment today and it was good.Overall looks like it is a keeper, but if edge screen sensitivity is not fixed, I will exchange that phone to Note 6 in the near future. (Hope they will not make it with curved edge – I hate it)."
"I just bought this phone a few weeks ago and Im just lovin it, great performance, awesome pictures, I love the display and how smooth is"
"I moved from ios to android and i felt like coming back home. Phone display , camera clarity amazing. Gold colour looks superb. Iphone 6 was so borning and this phone feels very exciting. Price was also good for unlocked international verson. Battary easily works for day and half with moderate data usage throught day"
thieves 😠
Best phone ever
Love mine it's awesome😍
I love it so much thank you! Cant believe I bought this expensive fone as a reward to myself. Too expensive but its ok I am very satisfied and happy! Thank you Amazon!
"I bought this phone for my dad and he is in love with it. It has fast-charging and all the high end specs that you could ask for in a top tier device. I don't know much about it, besides the fact that there hasn't been any issues thus far. It's got some interesting features and is a pleasure to use, I can tell you that much!"
Love this phone. Super fast. Screen is nice and big. Loaded with a bunch of great features.I connected it with cricket. Only 55 a month get great signal (cricket uses att towers)So i get nice fast connection with a low monthly cellphone bill.
"Love this phone. I upgraded from a galaxy s5 and it was well worth it. Aside from its design, what I love the most about this phone is its battery life. I can easily go a whole day, with moderate use of course, without having to charge the phone. The screen size is also perfect for my taste, not too big or too small. Strongly recommend."
"I bought this phone one week ago... I have no idea why there're some black stripes on my screen. When I increase the light, it's smaller..."
"I by the phone , and the screen have black point in corner left side..is damage.."
When I purchased this phone I was under the impression that it was unlocked. Now I find that it only works with at&the This is a scam . This phone only works on the AT&T network. It will not work on Verizon. Do not be fooled. This phone is not unlocked.
"Awesome device, water resistant, pretty fast. It's going to work with a lot of carrier all over the world. Beautiful external case made of glass. Samsung did it pretty good this time, for sure. The product came with an adapter for if you want to use it in the US. Another important feature is that you can still use this in the US and have the 4G compatibility, the only thing that you are going to miss it is the processor as the other US version has a better processor using the snapdragon 820. However, the Samsung exynos is pretty powerful too, so you probably wont feel the difference."
I received my package with no phone just a charger and headphones. Complete rip off!
Best phone ever it was easy to activate in my mobile service.
"This phone is the best i've ever had so far! If you have the cash and looking for a new phone, do not hesitate on buying it!"
Nice phone
"Mejor, IMPOSIBLE!"
Phone came nice and all but won't hold charge. I need to charge it twice or sometime 3 times a day. I am thinking about doing a reset and see where it will lead me. But now I am away from home and won't be back for 2 to 3 weeks in other to exchange it. Grrrr I hate this
I purchased this phone from world wide distributors early last month and I have had the phone for just little over a month and it is defective!!!! My screen keeps blanking out and there are lines which are running through the screen which proofs that the phone had some underlying screen issues prior to being purchased by me. As you can see from the picture you can swe the lines which for under the screen and each time I try to complete an action the screen is forever blanking out and having lines. I am requesting an immediate of my money as this has been a waste. Do not buy
"Love this phone, great battery life and it's silky smooth UI."
"I bought it six months ago. Now it has overheating problems and the screen is flickering. Without warranty service, buy this phone is a waste of money."
"Perfect!!, just as adviced"
it made for middle east so there is Muslim holidays in calendar and other apps installed
Excelent product.. love it.
Was completely understand impression it would work on US Verizon. It did not.
nice phone
Was as expected
Fantastic
"Love it!!! its so beautiful, so fast!!! I love it love it love it!!!"
Works great
"Arrived in great shape, very fast setup, works great! I have used over 3 weeks and this is a fantastic device."
It à good phone
"Great phone, everything looks nice, thank you. I'll be testing it and let everybody know how it goes. But so far it's awesome.It's been a while now and in gotta say this phone is fantastic. I've had a galaxy phone since the G-S2 till this one and believe me, this one is by far the phone I've ever had. Yes it can improve for example, the back cover would be great in aluminum (kinda like iphone) it'll prevent from cracking in minor accidents. The speakers can always be louder I guess. Oh yeah I forgot, the battery... Omg is the best thing ever, thank you Samsung you did great."
I've had nothing but issues with this phone since I got it. I have apps randomly opening and closing on it's own. I've read online that it is due to the screen being too sensitive. I've been waiting for a update from Samsung on this matter but it seems like my phone was from Egypt and I have not received an update yet. Pretty much the phone has been unusable for me because I can't even type or navigate the phone without it closing me out of applications or opening up ones randomly. I am very disappointed in this. What are my options?
"It is a great phone overall. It is running exynos processor, which was made by samsung. The packaging also include the American plug adapter since the device was made for European country. It is unclocked and works well of tmobile. It should work with other services as well."
It's ok 52%
"Good phone, works great on AT&T. They can't block WiFi Hotspot with this phone. I have unlimited data grandfathered but was never able to use my phone as a Hotspot with an AT&T phone. Only drawback is it comes with a European wall plug."
I was completely satisfied!
My seller Wlaphones did all as promised. They sent the phone in 2 days and had no problem no change the delivery address since I moved and totally forgot to make the change. 5 stars to the seller and 5 stars to the phone. I've had it for around 2 weeks and had no problems to activate it in TMobile. Amazing phone and great seller
"Is not a Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE.(SM-G935F) .It's a regular Galaxy S7 (SM-G930F)..accidental mistake or intentional error , But it's not the product that I payed for..I'am realy furious ..Be Carefully .."
The seller was good. They send me a sealed box. The problem is the phone. I bought it to use in Argentina. When I opened the phone in Argentina there was a pink line on the screen. It's a full pixel dead line across the screen. Y search on internet and it is a common problem with the edge phones and the solution is a new module/screen. There is no guaranty for me here.
"This phone is absolutely amazing. I could go on about the class leading camera, the all-day battery life, the amazing screen, the unquestionably useful Always On Display. That's probably not the most impressive thing about this phone though. Think about an iPhone 6/6S/7 Plus. Now think of the most annoying problem with that phone. If you're like me then the most annoying problem is undoubtedly the ENORMOUS bezels on the side of the phone. For those of us who want a bigger screen (because it usually means more features/a better viewing experience) the iPhone is damn near impossible to hold in the hand because after the screen ends, there is a huge swath of space on the sides that add several critical millimeters to the width of the phone. Not with this phone. The curved display not only looks amazing, but serves to give the phone a very compact footprint for the 5.5"" screen you are getting.That being said, there are things I don't like. Samsung still needs to make their software more stable and less energy inefficient. The longevity is more a virtue of the large battery than the software. Additionally the software can sometimes have funny quirks. Nothing too bad, but just things that are a little weird or slow sometimes.I also recommend that you buy a case for this phone. More than anything else on the market it's a work of art and you'll want to preserve it. I personally recommend this: Spigen Thin Fit Galaxy S7 Edge Case with SF Coated Non Slip Matte Surface for Excellent Grip for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 2016 - Black. This case is thin and almost feels like it isn't there. It'll make your phone easier to grip and give you piece of mind while you're out all day with it."
Received the phone and it was cracked
"Don't buy anything from this seller/company. I bought a Samsung Galaxy s7 edge, not even 2 months after the cell phone stopped working, Plus they don't accept returns."
Pretty nice phone. it looks great. it is very fast and i love the camera.
I am not happy with the phone because according to the phone description your website the phone should have two slot sin your website the phone should have two slot for SIM card as was described for the middle east and African version. So I send the form back home which is Ethiopia for my sister so she will be able to use it for school but now she can't use it for school. And I bought that phone for $660 and I have no use for it now thanks
As described
"Marvellous phone! Just as expected. Arrived some days late but I'm sure it was because the company ships all their orders in an specific date and that's why they offer several days or hours to order for the Prime Shipping. The first day I used it, It overheated A LOT, I was worried because I didn't want to return it after all the days I waited and the complication of waiting again for another one. But i searched the problem up and its normal for it to occur the first day, its setting up anyways, first day of startup. Until now, I've had it for about 2 months. The S7 Edge, exceeds expectations. Runs games smoothly and fast! The ability to switch apps and for them to stiill be active is amazing. Great phone, I'll update this soon with more information on how I'm doing with it."
"I really liked this phone, also I am so glad about amazon's services thank you for everything."
all according to expectations
Came with scratches on the lower right hand corner. Everything else was in good shape.
the phone just lasted two weeks then starts going freeze and doesnt turn on again
"Everything is perfect with the device but one of the sides of the box was ripped. Plus they gave me an adapter that works for England, not the US version."
the best phone out there
"excellent product smartphone came as I wait for Maracaibo, Venezuela 100% recommended"
ExcellentI bought it for a friend he got it today and is very very happy with his gift
Very nice product.
"so far is amazing, fast, awesome screen. I haven't try the unlocked since I need new Sim card, now it uses the nano simple card, but I'm expecting to work."
"I'm a bit disappointed with my shipment. Only got European socket charger but no american charger or adapter like people say they got on other reviews. Also seal of packaging was already broken! And also packaging was kind of workn. Still phone looks great, bummer I will have to get a proper charger before using it! To nake things worse now phone is almost 10 dollars cheaper than when I bought few days ago."
great value product!
Awesome phone. Would recommend it highly
This phone works perfectly thus far.. I'm loving it!!
"very good product and perfect delivery, thanks"
Excelent phone
"Bought this specifically because I wanted the Exynos processor instead of the Snapdragon and so that I can root if I wanted to. I'm on T-Mobile US and did my research to ensure that my bands are supported - which they all are except for some 3G. I bought this phone from a seller named 'lifeline###' and the box the phone came in had the factory seal. As another reviewer pointed out, my phone originated from the United Arab Emirates so this came with a non-US friendly charge adapter and the manual appears to be in English & Arabic. In any case, the phone is great working order and I was able to just pop in my T-Mobile SIM card with no configuration needed, nor a visit to the T-Mobile store!I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 so all I had was the regular charging block which doesn't support the fast charge. I went ahead and purchased the Aukey QC 3.0 block and I'm fast charging away!"
Good product.
Love my new phone
"Excellent Smartphone. Great Camera, Awesome for multimedia."
"Incompatible with AT&T, no 4G reception"
Solid phone
Received product excellent phone.
This phone is manufactured for Asia market so if you live outside Asia you will not have it fixed by Samsung in you country!
very good
Factory seal was open and phone appears to be tampered with. Not sure if phone is a genuine Samsung phone or a knock off. Also weird software installed on phone as well. Not sure what else is installed. Will be returning ASAP.
It's a really good cell phone. The delivery time was great.
Legit Company. The phone is brand new no issues... & these guys are fast!!!
Great
I have it for a about a year and works great!
"Screen failed in under 4 months. No warranty, no repairs. You are paying for a future $600 brick."
Works with American AT&T no problems. The 4g lte symbol does not show up but I know I get the speeds. Very happy that I purchased it
"Love this phone so far. It has been reliable and works as advertised. This is the international version, which means certain apps, like Samsung Pay, don't work. It's only come up a couple of times, but it is annoying. Not a negative on the phone, it's clear that this is the case. Just wanted to spread awareness."
"do not buy a international phone some features will not work,,,,,,,,, This seller is slow on returns"
"I bought this phone in August for my wife, the phone has been a hassle from the get go. Two weeks after purchase the volume button started moving erratically on its own. Then the phone started hanging and will not reset by just switching off the phone, we need to hold the power button and the decrease volume button at the same time. The frequency of hanging just kept increasing, even after the doing a factory reset the phone continued to deteriorate. I am highly disappointed! I would have returned the phone if the window had not elapsed. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"
"Excelente Product!! No objections, just get a antislip case cause is like silk"
Its a bad experiencie because I Lost almost $120
Best phone ever.
Item came as described.
Like
It's an awesome phone for sure.
Love it.
Excellent mobile phone. Beautiful design with the best camera !
I use this phone good
Perfect phone except for the fact I cannot connect to 4GLTE in Texas on AT&T. I may try out TMobile and see if that network will connect @ 4GLTE. Anyone with suggestions on how to connect to AT&T 4GLTE please let me know. I have used the APN settings from AT&T website to no avail. I would give it 5 stars if not for the LTE issue. It will connect as 4G only NOT 4GLTE (San Antonio Texas)
"this model doesn't support samsung pay!!before you buy, you should know it!!"
I sm really happy with the product and the service provided
perfect
excellent
"The phone is amazing! the screen is simply the best on the market right now. I read different comments about unreliable sellers selling fake or refurbished phones. I was lucky I bought mine from seller, theCoos. Got the phone new as described without problem."
"AWESOME phone. Came prepackaged, sealed, Turned on in English. There was an Arabic file of some sort - which I deleted. The model number matches correctly. No issues or problems getting it going and activated. Took it to my local AT&T store for the sim card and it took a little extra time and a couple of restarts, but after that everything is working great. I'm still learning some of the little tricks that come with it. The cell coverage shows ""4G"", not ""4GLTE"". I don't know the difference. The ATT guy said some would say it was better, LOL. I have no idea but, whatever. There are a few pre-installed samsung/google things. Smart Switch uploaded many things, but some things like ringtones were not backed up. I had to go looking for them. In the process, I also discovered some new ones. Battery is doing just fine and lasts as expected. It has it's own Samsung factory warranty - 1 year. I haven't been able to find any way to tell for sure if this is the snapdragon or xynos processor, but as I stated earlier, the model number matches, so....my first experience with an unlocked phone purchase on Amazon has gone well, IMHO. Thus far."
"The Samsung Galaxy S7 is perhaps the best mobile device right now. With so much technology, it has boosted the Galaxy S series. It is very easy to use and it makes you feel as if you don't have a mobile, instead you have so much more."
do not have samsung pay for international version. which is the main reason why I select samsung.
Device works fine and is fully unlocked and shipped in two days. All around good service
I'm kind of afraid that I wasted my money buying this considering all of the negative reviewsi just read. I surely hope that it works out when I receive it
"Good product, but a little defect. The home button make big noise when pressing it."
Thanks very good
"Hi WP, Thank you...I love my awesome phone."
"Good, no problems. Its been 4 months."
"My wife loves the phone. No problems with this one and I hope none come about. Other than getting a lemon on the first phone she received, this one seems to be perfect. Samsung is my favorite brand. Love all thier stuff.Amazon is great at helping customers take care of any problems they have with item by ensuring return shipping is easy and refunds are fast."
Thanks for nice and good product
"The cellphone was broken, bad seller"
Amazing
The phone is not working and when i turn it on the screen turns to green color
Nice smartphone. Nice experience with seller.Maybe could be different type of charger. Anyway it's all right.
Works Perfect
"i bought this as a gift, my girlfriend loved it. she had an iphone 5, and dindt want to use android.But now, 1 month later, she regrests not making the transition before.great phone. i had no problem using it on tmobile or cricket network."
Good
"I use StraightTalk with this phone. It took no more than an hour to transfer my phone number to this phone, and I had exactly 0 issues with it since. If you want a brand new unlocked phone, I would recommend no further than this. It did come with some sort of foreign software, and Facebook and Instagram seem to be installed and non-removable, but they were trivial to disable."
good
"Easily the best phone I've owned. Period. Great battery life compared with my last 3 phones (xperia Z2/Note 4/LG G4) Extremely fast, reliable, easily manages all my applications (55), great camera, waterproof.. And on and on... Great phone.. Really worth the price. Chose it over the S7 due screen size and battery life expectancy."
no 4G LTE .. Wireless PLACE..w
Those black lines showed up from no where. I don't know what is the problem . I would like to get an exchange please
I'like. Good product.
It's not working. I need new one Tuesday. Wednesday I'm going back to Turkey. If I can't get one till Tuesday it doesn't matter what I liked or disliked about this
Samsung android phone is the best way to go. So glad they put the mini-sd storage back in.
"Amazing phone, totally better than the s7 normal. The edge rocks and is si much better in every aspect!!!"
i can not use samsung pay and video calling facility in it.
Nice
It is working perfectly. I love it
very great phone i was abit worried when i ordered this but after recieving it using it i love it allot just some buyers know that with some carriers when u goto activate ur signal may just say 4g or lte or 4glte depends on where u r and ur carrier as for mine i have at&t usa and my signal says 4g i was hoping it would say 4glte maybe over time it will i dunno
good
Best cell phone ever. *****
"It's an awesome phone. The edge takes a little getting used to, but that's a small issue. Great camera, awesome sound in music and talking. Love the anti-glare. Seriously no glare from any angle. Even the headphones were great. Clear, crisp sounds. I bought the unlocked version and it works perfectly. Just had to insert the sim card and that was it. (And that's in the Caribbean) so for those customers wandering, it's definitely an Unlocked International Version. Highly recommended."
excellent service and product
Great
It is a great original phone which registered in United Arab Emirates. That's why that cheap.
"this is the best cell phone I have. The size is almost the same as Samsung S5, except the format edge give us a very pleasant touch and view! The camera is exceptional, have auto focus and it is impossible to have bad pictures. The only problem is that it is so sensitive that a single harder touch can become multiple pictures..This is definitely the BEST SAMSUNG S series phone, and if the money is not the problem, forget the S7 and go to the S7 Edge!!!"
Great product so far..
S7 edge is the best
So far no!!!!!! I ordered the Samsung galaxy s7 EDGE GOLD and received the regular s7 in silver like wtf
"Very good phone. It's an international version, with adapter."
Excellent
Excelent!!
Excelente gracias
Has lots of cool and helpful features. Performance is very good. I highly recommend purchase if you are considering switching or upgrading
I received the wrong power plug. Did not get the US type.
"It was perfect for a month until just yesterday, it suddenly crashed while I was using it and will no longer properly boot up. Going to try calling Samsung for servicing tomorrow, hopefully the warranty works.**Edit update 11/19: Samsung said that their US warranty does not cover for international versions and fixing it myself did not work. Luckily, I called Amazon and they very kindly allowed me to return the phone for a full refund! If you are facing the same problem you might want to try this asap!"
Good value for the money
It's good so far
The rear glass is broken. The headphone does not work. I guess that's why it's cheap.
"Phone arrived OK it functioned fine. After one month problems started. Phone constantly reboots. Some times gets stuck, no hard reset is possible, only need to wait for battery to die. Next thing phone died altogether. There is no warranty from the shipper TheCoos !!!. Now I am stuck with this brick and do not know how to fix it. I did not expect such a poor performance from a supposedly top of the line phone. Maybe this ""International version"" is fishy. I strongly advise: Do not buy this phone!!!."
The product start to have problems with the screen and the vendor dosen't have any to say about that
"I like the S7 Edge a lot. Very sold phone, good battery life. Nice looks."
Works great! excelent product!
Over heating
This is a fantastic device. Works well in my country and costs $350 less than in my country. I know you won't believe it but it is a sad fact.
Terrible can i return it?
Everything was perfect
i love it. i used my unlocked phone in Ecuador it worked fantastic.

"This phone is so much faster than the Galaxy S6 Edge I upgraded from. The biggest difference I noticed was the battery life lasts double what the last phone did. Plus, the screen is big. Can't go wrong with the Ultra HD resolution. The only problem I have with it is that it's the Italian version and won't let me use the Samsung Pay like my American S6 Edge did. Kind of a bummer, but we still live in a time where I have to lug my driver's license around, so my credit card might as well come along for the ride."
"I bought my phone in June. I live in Boston, MA where the weather has started to get cold now. I'm a commuter and tend to spend a lot of time outside, and I believe its been the change in temperature that has caused some intrusive, glitchy streaks to appear very boldly along my screen, which interupts my view of everything on my screen."
"I have just got the phone and I am very happy with the quality so far. Great camera, fast processing. Compatible with an AT&T Go Phone SIM card. I will update this review once I try inserting an international SIM card as well."
The best phone I ever owned... great stuff!
Great product won't regret buying.
good excelent.
Love Samsung phone and tablets
This phone is really fast and there is no lag for multitasking.
It is working fine just like the seller descrived
This phone is absolutely amazing. Everyday I learn something new about it. Amazing
I was nervous about purchasing an international version of this phone but I'm happy I did. I actually owned a US AT&T version prior to this model and I can confirm the following after several days of use and testing:1) The International version has the faster Exynos 8890 vs Snapdragon 820.2) Battery life appears to be better than the Snapdragon 820 US model.3) No problems with AT&T LTE 4G.4) No AT&T bloatware!So far I highly recommend it!

"Beautiful phone, features are awesome! Still discovering something new about this phone daily. The camera quality is the best I've seen yet.It's very difficult getting a screen protector that fits , bought 2 and they didn't fit the edges (although it stated that it was designed for S7 edge!!!) Still trying to get one that fits.Very expensive phone though 🙁!!! But I am really enjoying it..."
"Great phone , just as advertising, delivery on time , everything was A+"
"Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G935F- Black OynxAbsolutely disappointing, the charging port was hurt at 4 days, and today after 10 days has begun to smoke and smell of burning. I'll have to repair the ""new"" cell. I'm angry and I'll never buy in this shop."
"It is perfect this phone . First time that I bought a phone online and I had a very good experience . It's in very good condition and I got the phone next day . The only thing it's that on the back doesn't say ""galaxy s7 edge"""
"Bought this phone and have had it for several weeks. Absolutely love it ! fast and smooth, battery life is amazing. I'm with AT&T and if you can sacrifice wifi calling... this is the way to go. although it doesn't have all the LTE bands I have absolutely no trouble. My job requires me to travel often and I get great coverage everywhere, even in the gulf of mexico. I am now an exynos s7 edge fan boy."
Excelente Producto. Vendedor Recomendable
"if u have tmobile by this with confidence I was very hesitant at first people saying this is designed for a different region, until i remembered that I am middle eastern and the phone I previously bought was designed for middle east and worked great here in the US until I decided to upgrade, the only difference you will notice is the pre installed apps for the region and that chargers may have different inputs because it was designed for Europe or middle east, my seller that i bought from solved the charger issue by providing a complementary connectorgo for it, be brave for once."
"Everything went well, excelent product. Hope do not explode!"
i love my galaxy s7 i have no words
Great
"I purchased this S7 edge back in March. After two months, it started showing some screen color issues with annoying purple stripes all over the screen and the cellphone itself feels hot. I had to set the brightness to the maximum to temporarily ""avoid"" screen issues. And what's worse, the screen just died completely and I can't even turn off this phone since the screen is no longer functioning. Now I am trying to return this failed S7 edge and get my money back and never gonna buy any Samsung product again."
exccelent product
Awesome phone....
As advertised
Very good phone
The screen times out while I am using the phone. And my low light camera isn't functioning properly.
"Excellent product I love it. No regret for price paid, it really worth it."
I like it nothing was wrong with my phone the seal wasn't broken it the real Samsung galaxy s7 edge not fake so thanks
Amazing phone from a hardworking seller. Thanks!
Ok
"Great looks, camera, speedy.Overall great device."
was not for me
Excelent phone very recomended seller
Works perfectly and the product came nicely packed.
Perfect. Great phone
I already have this phone for about a month and I haven't found any problem with it. Is legit and works perfectly.
"I wanted to write this review mainly to share information on this product. The product reached well before said time. It was delivered in good condition. The phone is as equivalent to buying a samsung galaxy s7 edge in a carrier store.Only disadvantage that I have come across so far is - The samsung pay app doesn't work in this phone.So if you are interested in Samsung pay, you should consider other options."
Phone is faulty screen stopped working after 1month
Excelent product.
"I am very satisfied with S7 Edge, I have the international version. Fast charging, great photos and great screen."
"Hi guys, I am using my new Galaxy S7 Edge about 1 1/2 month, and your charger stop working, this device have some kind of warranty? i am currently living in Ecuador.Regards."
I love my phone. Good condition. Beautiful. And not too expensive for this item. Thank you.
Fantastic
I rate this as a 100 % not a fake fun everything is fully clean
"the phone was good, the packaging was terrible"
Do not like it very much
Great phone. I just love it
Nice seller and excellent product.
Good phone
Perfect
It's ok 52%
"Good phone, works great on AT&T. They can't block WiFi Hotspot with this phone. I have unlimited data grandfathered but was never able to use my phone as a Hotspot with an AT&T phone. Only drawback is it comes with a European wall plug."
feels too bulky I'm glad I bought a new iPhone 7 much slimmer and miles ahead in voice quality
Love my phone Samsung is a boss
The charger comes with the UK Plug. Would have been nice to know it before buying it.
I cannot make video call
Excellent!!!!!!
Todo ok..!!
Excellent cellphone. Battery is amazing.
"I received this phone yesterday and instantly fell in love with it. I have owned several Galaxy phones (s3, s4, s4 active, and s5). So far I love it! It came sealed in the original box. I cannot use the charger adapter that came with it, but I expected that as it's an international version.I picked the gold color, it looks and feels elegant and sleek. I love the interface, the phone itself is super fast. The phone has a big, beautifully bright screen. I am still getting used to its size. The fingerprint scanner is noticeably better than that of the gs5. Both cameras take amazing pictures.I am one of those people that are constantly on their phones during most of the day. It has an excellent battery life and charges very fast.I did read a couple reviews where people complained about the phone slipping out of their hands. I have used an Otterbox Symmetry Series case since I took it out of the box and have not had that problem at all.My only complaint about this phone is that it does not have an IR blaster, but I can live with that.I will update my review in the future if anything changes.UPDATE:I have been using this phone for about a month now and it is still just as amazing as when I took it out of the box. It still has amazing battery life. I have a Pocket Juice power bank that I was using around noon every day with my Gs5 but I have not used it at all with this phone. It usually still has 15% after about 12 hours of use.I have not had any lagging or random restarts like I did with my Gs5. The phone is still amazingly fast and responsive.I have slightly tested the waterproofing of this phone. The fingerprint scanner does not work well when wet, but the touch screen is still responsive.I have a Otterbox Symmetry Series case that I use with this phone and I have noticed that it causes the Zagg Dry screen protector to bubble up around the edges (I would like to state that I did NOT allow the protector 24 hours to ""cure"" after applying before putting the case back on, so that could be the reason.) I have heard that with the edges it is hard to find a case/screen protector combination that doesn't cause bubbling at the edges.Overall I would definitely recommend this phone."
Nice phone
"Mejor, IMPOSIBLE!"
The best smartphone.I feel like a baby with new toy.
"Perfect size, amazing front camera and super fast phone..."
I received my phone on time and it's working perfect
Why does this phone have different features than my friends like this one say about device and my friends says about phone and MA you more stuff too but why
Amazing and beautiful!
"Best phone available today. Stunning 4K display, amazing camera and water proof....whaaaaatttttttt. Awesome."
Best phone ever! Happy and satisfied!
really nice phone
Great. Fabolous. I love it.
amazing phone and the service from this guys is absolutely exceptional
Great product.
It's a good one
Excellent performance. A superb phone
This phone is way too fragile. It fell from less than a foot and was totaled. The edge design must make the glass thin and fragile. I’m seeing people complain about the phone breaking without even being dropped.My other phones were never in a case and took many falls from 3-4 feet and only incurred scuffs. I dread the day my replacement breaks because I know it’s going to happen; it’s way too fragile.
Ok
excellent phone
Nice phone i like it
"Mailed out fast! Got it a day early! So glad i got the international version! And there is 4 reasons why.....Reason 1 - NOT FILLED WITH A TON OF BLOATWARE! No At&t crap apps. It does have a few like facebook and instagram. But most people use them and other than that just disable it....Reason 2 - Because it's the international version... We have the GALAXY LAB! Where you can get the app draw remove! which I enjoy. American Carriers Took it out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Reason 3 - Paying full price, I am not stuck in a contract for 2 years where the bill doesn't lower after the 2 years are up. OR not stuck in a monthly contract paying off the phone paying interest.Reason 4 - I HAVE NO STUPID CARRIER LOGO ON MY PHONE!!!! Such an EYE SORE and aggravation for a company to put there logo on another companies devise thats is sold off to the consumer.... its s***ty graffiti."
great phone
Awesome phone....
"DO NOT TRUST this product on this seller.I bought TWO WEEKS AGO and the device showed:1.) problems with fingerprint lock. Basically this feature adds 30 seconds of waiting time before using your phone, since it consistenly does not work, and it locks your phone after 3 tries.2.) Phone would consistenly freeze (once a day) with the watch on. The only solution is restaring the phone. and the freezed clock is an extra because it made me lose a few meetings.3.) ""unbreakle glass"" screen broke after ONE WEEK OF USE, in my FRONT pocket, without never even even falling on the flor. it was ONE SINGLE coin that made the damage."
"My husband and I bought these as an upgrade from our previous Galaxy S5s. I got the rose gold and he got the black one. The rose gold color wasn't as rosy as I thought it would be, it's more of a champagne color. The black one looks very sophisticated and elegant. I must say that I was not a fan of Samsung borrowing Apple's idea of no memory storage and making it difficult to put the sim card in but it was an easy fix with being able to send all of my extra photos to my Samsung account. Upon arrival, the packaging makes sure the product is not harmed whatsoever (lots and lots of bubble wrap). In all honesty I was afraid the phone was not going to hold up very long because of the glass edge and because I'm prone to dropping my phone...a lot. However even with out a case it has held up quite well. The photo quality of the front and rear camera is amazing, definitely a step (or two) up from the S5. We decided to buy on amazon because the price listed was $200-$300 cheaper than buying in stores, plus free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime. All in all I would highly reccommend this phone if you're a Samsung lover like myself."
LED screen started to flash in and out and show a blue screen after 3 weeks. Battery is already over heating after 3 weeks of use. Battery life sucks.
Inserted AT&T and works absolutely fine.Great phone.
"I bought the cellphone as gift for my brother, and to honest, he's really happy.Service was really good, I'm really satisfied about the product and also the serviceGood job!"
I love it
CAME WITH A WRONG CHARGER FOR EUROPE VERSION
You have background colors in it but the second one that I received it worked perfect
"I will never again buy a phone through a cell service provider. Buying unlocked through Amazon or some other reputable source saves you about 20%, and here's the really great part: no bloatware! Be careful to ensure that the phone will work with your service provider, but if it will this is the way to go without a doubt."
Awesome phone!
Amazing one
"Sooo ummm I got it the next day after ordering it, which is crazy. I done my personal testing and I'm really Impressed makes my note 1 feel like a brick.... edited part: I dropped it in a huge puddle today sat for a good 7 mins under water, pulled it out and still works great"
Excellent
good
"Came in perfectly fine, works fine. Is sexy. Yes."
Love the phone I was a little scare at first because some of the paper instructions were in arabic but I put the phone to work without trouble manage to change the settings to english and spanish .It is a great phone charge really fast the adapter came for middle east kind of current but they were kind and send a travel adapter for it works great so far I am really happy thank you.
The phone was working pretty awesome then it just crashed and wouldn't turn on. Did all the troubleshooting I could and it still wouldn't turn on. So I had to return item.
"Excellent product, it cover al my expectations and more. The seller has a great attention."
Excelente
Loved!
"Incredible Smartphone. Every single detail you must want ina phone, it comes with it."
It's Samsung! :)
Very good
There is a mark on screen from the day it came and there is lot of heating issue with phone
"The phone was unlocked but was formerly a Sprint serviced phone. It turned out to be a stolen product and Sprint was able to disable the voice and messaging functions. However Amazon did back it up with a refund for me. Next, I bought the same phone but used, not refurbished, with a different service provider, thru Amazon. It has my carrier on it (t-mobile) and have had no issues with it. It is also unlocked.Great camera. Except it gets fuzzy at max zoom."
Excelente. Recomendamos
I Bought this phone as a gift for my sister and brother in Europe. The phones arrived in brand new condition with seal and in a timely manner. They absolutely love the Samsung over their previous phones( iPhone6). They have stated the phone is absolutely amazing and beautiful. It works wonderfully for their purpose and the quality is good. Watching videos look great and the photo quality is gorgeous. They are happy with the expansive memory.
Satisfied.
Great Phone !
"All issues regarding the Galaxy S7 edge were well received except for the app Samsung Pay. It doesn't seem to be available, tried to download and was presented with a Not compatible with this device warning. But for the most part, it meet all qualifications as advised."
"The delivery of the phone was before time and the phone works flawlessly.. Do not worry about anything, you will never regret buying this device"
"I bought the S7 Edge and received it a few weeks ago. It is an excellent phone, however, it did freeze and had to be replaced. There are software flaws in the S7. Wireless Everything provided prompt service and I would definitely buy from them again."
It did meet my expection and I am so sati
product is as expected! had to return and the return pricess was also smooth
Decent phone no problems but at that price a warranty would of gave it 5 stars
"Be wary of the Edge phones. My husband dropped his from about 1 foot and the screen shattered. I have heard about this happening with other Samsung Edge products, but I have had so many phones and not once have the screens cracked so I thought I would be fine. I was wrong. I should have listened to others."
same as the one I would have gotten from AT&T except unlocked. The only difference is that samsung pay won't work yet.
"excellent product, highly recommendedClosed box wine"
Samsung> Iphone
Love Samsung phone and tablets
Its a bad experiencie because I Lost almost $120
Good item.
FRAUD!!!... Phone is from Brazil and does not work.
ok
ok
good every thing
"great deal, great seller!"
it is an excellent cellphone
Great
"Although this phone was advertised as being unlocked, it would not connect to the AT&T network when we took it to get it activated. The AT&T employee told us that it was not unlocked or it would connect immediately. He even restarted it to double check. The Amazon representative who started the returns process gave us the name and phone number of the company that actually sold it. When we called that number, a Verizon automated service answered the phone. So my conclusion is that the phone must be locked to Verizon. My 15 year old son worked all summer and saved his money to buy this brand new phone on his own and took great pride in that fact. He is so disappointed."
"Arrived on time, came in sealed box, looked new an outside. I wish I could see an inside. Samsung Manufacturer/assembly in Vietnam. Works fine with T-Mobile. I will try on others carriers."
DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!! THEY ARE SELLING FAKE GALAXY S7 EDGES!!!! The box will be opened and not sealed. When the phone is on you will notice that there is a black line around the screen that should also not be there. Those are two dead giveaways that this is a cheap Chinese fake.
Thanks all is perfect
"Everything perfect, I recomend!"
I was a little hesitant that this phone wasn't going to be what I ordered but I was wrong. The first time opening the box was truly amazing I tried the phone out for two week and I'm loving the phone. Everything works fast and I'm very happy that I got it in the white version. The only problem for me was delivery but it is not the fault of the seller. I would've liked it if the left it on my porch because I had to drive and get it from the nearest ups store. Overall the best smartphone of 2016 I don't care what anybody says.
Love this.
Before buying refurbished phone from seller MASTERTRONICS. I had asked if it was compatible with my provider and if it had large scratches. He assured me full compatibility and no scratches. I have to say he was right phone works perfectly and have not one scratch I would definitely recommend this seller I will definitely purchase from seller again thank you for this amazing buy it could not ask for more.
Matt every expectation shipped quickly got here well and was easy to set up
"I bought the white version of the Samsung S7 edge and it is a amazing and gorgeous phone. It was really difficult to find it because it's not available for the US but it totally worth the trouble. I got the italian edition of it and it works nice and smooth with my Mexican SIM card, it doesn't has any preloaded content which is great and the preinstalled apps are the same as the US version. The only ""issue"" might be that the power connector of the charger is European, but the seller solved it in a great way by including an American adapter. I love my new phone and the whole experience was excellent with this seller.I used to be an iPhone lover, but Samsung did a great jog with this one and I'm perfectly happy of having taked the risk. Totally recommended!"
Works fantastic. Arrived on time. Thanks for a great product and purchasing experience.
Found severe OVER-HEATING problem.
I've gotten this phone twice. One for my wife and one for myself and both come two days earlier from the date it was suppose to come. The phone itself is wonderful and works great nothing off from it. I recommend to buy this phone from here
Excellent
I need to know how I can return my phone is warming muchI like but need another phone on the brink of both heating esplotar phone?
phone did not connect to AT&T 4G network. Provides basic internet access only. Cannot use.
the touch screen sometimes does not work
"Phone came broken, charger ports are faulty. This is the second faulty phone i have recieved. Dont know if the issue is samsung or the seller, but I would advise everybody not to buy this phone. If you are buying a european phone in the US, samsung usa will not be able to help you."
I've always been a fan of the iPhone series. In fact the last one I had was the iPhone 6s Plus. But I recently traded it out for the Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge. This phone is AMAZING and is lightning quick. It's very responsive to your touch and the 5.5 inch screen makes it a breeze to read whatever your doing on the phone. I am HIGHLY SATISFIED by this phone. I think Samsung really outdid themselves this time.
"Awesome, customizable, and Stylish !!!"
Screen was half green when it arrived. Do not buy.
i love it!!!!!!
"I've always been at the front of the smartphone market, usually replacing yearly, and I can say this phone is amazing. Pure and simple. Highly recommend."
"Excellent smartphone for discerning people who want the very best features and user experience.Comes factory unlocked and compatible with all major US carriers (Both GSM and CDMA) and with complete US Warranty. Zero bloatware. Beautiful silver design looks stunning and will grab everyone's attention. As soon as I inserted the SIM card, it automatically installed all special features from my carrier (Supports Wi-Fi calling & Hotspot from T-Mobile).I bought this device after extensive research to upgrade my aging Galaxy Note 2 smartphone. The Galaxy S7 Edge has arguably the best camera among flagship smartphones, water resistant, excellent battery life, access to all apps and content in Google Play Store, Amazon App Store, and Galaxy App Store. The user interface is very customizable thanks to free and premium themes in Samsung's store and custom launchers. You can extend storage space up to 256 GB via SD Card (Pro Tip: Get the best possible SD card in order to be able to record hours of crisp 4K video footage).If you're on the fence between this and another flagship smartphone (I was looking at the iPhone 7), what will win you over is the amount of productivity and creativity that is possible with this device due to unparalleled multitasking features and sheer computing power. Try doing two things at once on an iPhone and you will be sorely disappointed, maybe Google Pixel is a contender in this department."
Incredible phone!
"For the most part I think its a fantastic phone but especially with the curved screen, it is a bit slippery and hard to hold so a case is a must. Also, the battery life isn't quite as good as I was expecting but still decent. Otherwise, as far as performance and everything goes, I'm really happy with it, especially the beautiful camera! The only real complaint is the tiny amount of internal storage. There are some things like Google Play Music that store downloads on the internetal memory rather than an external card so it fills things up very fast and can cause issues. If they doubled the internal memory, that would be enough for me to bump it up to 5 stars."
Awesome phone
Phone came exactly as advertised. Was able to activate it with no problems and runs like the wind. No complaints.
The only thing...the seal was broken upon arrival! The phone appear to be in new condition.
Got Perfect product..
retired my s6 and am very happy with all the advanced features and organization of the aps. really intuitive.
I give the Galaxy S7 Edge a 5 star rating. It does everything I want from a cell phone.
The phone is amazing. I can't get the white one in North America so I ordered it through Amazon. The only thing is that it came with a eroupean charger which can easily be fixed by buying a piece to change it to North American styled plugs.
"Is a Korean version, works perfect in Agentina with 4g.LTE Claro network ..every thing goes find except por same apps and menues, that aperars in Korean..I disabed in order do not disturb. Upgrade also are working ok."
"I must say this first; this phone does not play nice with Sprint. It continuously goes through this activation loop with Sprint. It activates (Hands Free Activation), restarts, then activates again in a continuous loop. I don't know if it's on Sprint's end, or if its their UICC SIM card. I'm not even sure if it's the phone itself because it's doing the same thing on the replacement phone that Amazon sent to me.However, it works fine with T-Mobile, and the VoWiFi calling feature works well straight out of the box without any user configuration.I haven't tried it on AT&T or Verizon yet.Otherwise, other than the Sprint problem, the phone works great. The Wi-Fi works well; the display is bright, crisp, clear and brilliant; it's speedy fast (no lag); and it's basic (no carrier bloatware). It has 23 GB of available space out of the box.Another thing, I must say the phone gets really hot and the battery drains quickly, but, then, again, it could be entirely due to the Sprint Hands Free Activation looping thing. I don't know. I called Samsung, Samsung tells me to contact Sprint. I called Sprint, Sprint tells me to contact Samsung. This is frustrating !I have model number SM-G935UZSAXAA."
Excelent!
Very pleased with this purchase.
Great phone! Love it
excelent I like so much!!
Phone wasn't unlocked to be used in Asia. Had to pay for unlocking.
I saw a black spot/dent on the bottom left of my new S7 edge while unwrapping! I need a refund or replacement!
Really like this phone. I get a lot of compliments from others. The clarity of this screen is unbelievable. Great for video playback and gaming
Great phone. Edge not only aesthetic but also functional.
Couldn't have a better phone!
I received the phone on time but the phone kept on restating by itself.
"Upgrading from the Emerald Green s6 Edge to this was amazing! It feels great in the hand and runs smooth! Its extremely fast and eye catching! Everyone always asks where I got it and which stores sell it since it isn't available here in the US. My phone carrier is Metro PCS and I haven't had any problems with the phone or service since getting it activated/registered.Just know that you HAVE to bring it into the store to get it activated. Otherwise, popping in a SIM card that you already have and trying to use the phone will only last for so long until they realize your SIM is in a different phone. Part of their security shuts off your service if you do this without registering your new device with Metro PCS so please take your new phone in to get it activated. I hope that makes sense. Plus the employee at your local phone store will be amazed because they have probably never seen a white s7 Edge if you live in the states, haha! :P"
"The cellphone is amazing, it was shipped and delivered quickly. Mine is the US version unlocked (SM-G935U) and it works excellent with Metro PCS. Mine has warranty until September next year. You can check that with your imei when you get the phone on info.imeiBut...The phone didn't come with the Sim extraction tool, and the packaging was very bad, just a big cardboard box with another cardboard box and the phone inside, the should of put some air bags or something for couchon. Anyway the phone is in great condition and it hasn't given me problems so far. My phone came with the Samsung earphones, quick charger and cable. I truly recommend to get the phone a case. I got one from spigen, you should check it out, they do very nice cases."
Great Phone. Awesome camera. Exceed expectations.
This is the best phone ever. The size is perfect and it's a very quick operating system
New phone came out of case with data transfer adapter missing. Other accessories like charger cable and charger adapter were in the case. Not happy but did not want to go through the process of a return.
excelent
"I love the phone but I hate how some features aren't available such as android pay (Not available in my area), and also the changing time. It takes approx 40 min to charge from 30 percent using fast charge and fast charge products.If anyone can recommend a solution it would be greatly appreciated.Using a European version GS7 Edge in the USA. I don't know if it's the voltage."
So far so good. The only thing I just found out is that since it's an international unlocked phone from Italy I don't have warranty here for the phone in the US.
"This phone exceeded my expectations. I did some research beforehand about the 2 different chips that were put in the phones. I will have to say the international version has lived up to the hype. I've had this phone for about 3 weeks and there has only been one day where the battery was about to die. But this was after a 10 hour trip running Google maps, taking pictures, videos, games and other things. The phone was off the charger at 630 am and had 9% left at 830. Not bad going from a HTC One M7 that couldn't make it to 4pm without a charge. The camera is fast and takes great pictures. I've had a few compliments on how amazing the screen looks. The only thing I have heard other people complain was about not having Samsung Pay, I have never used it and I don't think it's a deal breaker."
Very nice phone. Son says it does a lot.
"If your LTE is not working on AT&T on this phone, you need to tell them to keep your old phone's IMEI in their system instead of putting the edge's IMEI in there. If you put the edge's IMEI in their system, for some dumb reason their system won't recognize the phone because it's international, and the system will automatically provision you down to 3G only. Also europe's 4G logo doesn't say ""LTE"", the logo just says 4G but it is in fact 4G LTE, just FYI. For more than a day I thought I was going to have to return this because I wasn't getting LTE, then I went to a different store the next day where I figured out to keep my old phone's IMEI in the system so I could get LTE on the international edge.I have had the phone for 4 weeks now I think, zero problems so far, nothing was wrong with the packaging. My edge came from Italy. Purchased from vendor ""Wireless Everything"", thank you."
"This is without a single doubt, the best smart phone on the market. I have played with the LG G5 and the HTC 10, and I can tell you neither are in the class of the S7, and especially not the S7 Edge Exynos version. The Exynos version has better battery life than the Snapdragon 820 version, and it does a much, much, much better job with power and memory management. The white one is my favorite, and I had to look high and low to find one. But I have it now, and it's very cool to have what almost nobody else has. Great phone! It's stylish, well built, beautifully sculpted with the best screen in the industry. Even touchwiz is light, fast and smooth. This phone has ZERO lag. Everything's better on the Edge. And don't let people tell you that the edge feature is gimmicky. It is EXACTLY what you make it. If you don't spend a minute learning what it can do, it will do little for you. But, if you decide to learn all of its features, and employ them fully, this feature can be one of the best on the device. I also didn't find it useful at first, because I allowed all of the reviewers to influence me that it is just a gimmick. But then I watched a review where the guy really laid out what it could actually do, and decided to look into it further. In the end, I have found it to be a vital part of my functions on this phone. So if you are part of the ""too lazy to discover"" generation, then you might not find it useful. But if you want to get all you can out of this device, it can become vital.One last thing, get a case for this phone immediately. The biggest drawback of this device is that if you break it, the waterproofing is gone, even after repair."
Excellent cell phone and Great service!! thank you so much
delivered fastgood phone so farthough many apps in chinese/korean that i cannot uninstall
"I have never bought a phone outside a carrier. That and the fact the label said International and No Warranty really had me concern. Not having ATT branding and stuff cluttering my new expensive phone was enticing though. Not having ATT block or delay my phone updates also was interesting. Having a white phone was a small but nice benefit too. So I cancel my ATT purchase and bought from Mercate Group. ATT said it would ship at the end of month, Mercate said I would have my phone by the end of month. Reality was Mercate quickly sent me my phone within a week. Did not have to pay extra for quick shipping either. When I contacted seller about warranty they said they would honor the 1 year warranty. With no sales tax through Amazon I saved $55, got my preferred phone unbranded and unlocked, quicker and cheaper than ATT. Though I must say ATT activated the phone to my GOPhone account quickly and easily with no charge either. So far I am extremely satisfied with everything regarding this purchase. As far as warranty we will have to wait and hope not to need it. Another thing is that the AC charger included has a European plug but an adapter was included, I think by Mercate,"
"Arrived on time, came in sealed box, looked new an outside. I wish I could see an inside. Samsung Manufacturer/assembly in Vietnam. Works fine with T-Mobile. I will try on others carriers."

Works fantastic. Arrived on time. Thanks for a great product and purchasing experience.
"Hated sending it back but this international version wouldn't work with TMo or ATT SIMs properly. Love the S7 Edge though. This dual SIM version wouldn't handle the two carriers cellular data properly. Once on wi-fi it would rarely transition to cell data without a reboot. Even then it didn't like two SIMs from different carriers. Suspect it is meant for two SIMs from the same carrier only. If I inserted a single SIM only, it worked better, but oddly my TMo SIM only got less than 1Mbps on band 12 LTE when the same SIM in a different phone pulled 15+Mbps consistently. ATT speeds when only 1 SIM inserted were consistent with other phones. If I can only use one SIM I might as well buy a single SIM US version so that wi-fi calling and VoLTE could work too, which they don't on this international version.Beyond the dual SIM issues, the Galaxy S7 Edge was a great phone. Awesome camera. Nice display."
awesome phone
Good
"All good, product (s7), delivering (Amazon.com)"
Got this phone for my husband and he absolutely love it!
"Could bem the right charger, im from brazil and is totaly different, i had to buy a new charger."
Excelente
magnificent
Everything is OK. Except the power plug is not fit to most socket.
Excelente
Good
I love my phone
Switched from iPhone 6 ... so much better!!!
Way better than i expected.The battery is the best that I ever saw.
Dual SIM International Version!
"Everything you've read about this phone is true. It is amazing. The screen is second only to the S7 (in terms of ppi), the camera is arguably the best on the market, and it is a monster in battery life and performance. Silver Titanium is undoubtedly the best color. Absolutely stunning. If Samsung found a way to implement stereo audio, it would be perfect, but it makes up for what it lacks in sound quality in its relative loudness and top of the line headphone output. Rest assured that you are buying the best phone on the market right now.--------------------------------Compliment it with a Spigen Neo Hybrid Crystal (I 100% recommend Gunmetal for a Silver Titanium GS7 Edge): http://amzn.com/B01AUORACQand a Armorsuit Case Friendly Screen Shield: http://amzn.com/B01ACXSKAG"
Great
I got my new galaxy s7 duos and the package came on time and good status.
Excellent
Package received without the actual phone which was probably stolen on the way
"Excellent product. Work on all gsm networks around the world. In USA works great with AT&T and T-Mobile. My comes with UK ac adapter, if you want to use at another countries you need to buy an appropriate Ac adapter."
Excelent!! The box was sealed really new in perfect condition. Congratulation!!
"Outstanding phone. Great features and the curved edge is great. Haven't had issues with this beauty. Most complaints I do not understand, unless they have personal problems. I've attached photo of the adapter that comes with it."
One of the best phones I've ever used. Got the Asian variant. Everything works well. Perfect condition.
"Great phone, so far I have used it in Canada as well as the states. Will see how it works in Europe next. My only gripe is losing one of the sim cards to the SD card for expanded memory. There is a hack for this but I haven't done it yet. It involves sticking the sim chip to the back of the SD card to have a dual slot."
"It's a shame that you have to choose between placing SIM2 or MicroSD. In previous versions of DUOS you could use SIM1, SIM2 and MicroSD simultaneously."
"The most ugly phone on the high end market. Ugly oblong shape, cheap shiny plastic look, ugly design of icons, oversaturated colors even in basic mode, and messy organization of apps and screens. Extra features like pulse sensing have marginal value at best. Good features: dual simm, large screen size to phone size ratio, low weight, waterproofing do not fully compensate for ugly design. Given a chance I would go for any other phone, especially HTC."
Fast and responsive
"Excellent phone, well worth the money over the S7 due to the larger screen. This is not a fake, it is the real deal. The phone I received is an international version (dual sim) from the UAE. It came with a UK charging plug."
"Chose an 'international' model, so I can use while stationed in China and USA... actually, I loved it for 2 months, then it developed a problem which i learned was common, thick gray bars on the screen, and which should easily and clearly be under Samsung's warranty, however I have discovered that the warranty is only good in Singapore, and nowhere outside Singapore. Wasted time on the phone with Singapore, and finally learned that I am out of luck, need to pay to get it repaired. So, BEWARE!!!!!!! I am screwed with a $700.00 POS."
"This phone is giving me problems despite being two months in use! Unfortunately I experienced problems with it when the return date has elapsedFacebook App is not working, I tried to reload it so many times but in vainSometimes it switches its self offAnd the battery life is also not good"
"The phone was working just fine for a few months other then the battery draining extremely fast until recently. The s7 edge had a green line that went across the top of the screen and started flashing white while I was using the phone. It later progressed so that the screen would turn white and you whould no longer able to see what was happening on the display. Keep in mind that the phones screen is still in one piece and the touch sensors where still working.I called Samsung technical support and they said that they do not support the international model and for me to contact the country that it was made in, Vietnam. I then messaged Vietnam Technical support and they say they do not support products from the US.If I had known that by buying an international phone, I wouldn't have a warranty through Samsung, I would not have bought this phone, its a waste of money.Seller: Open Group Wireless"
I started to see a bright pink line of the screen which wouldn't disappear. I have been maintaining the product with no impact. Shame!
Very Good phone
this is an amazing phone. best i have ever owned.
"Good buy.Months now.The retailer is too good and had a prompt follow up.The only one issue still haunting me is the charging time,it takes 2-3 hrs to charge from 0-50%.The retailer even send me a new charger free ,which didn't help me.i bought a wireless Samsung charger too ,but in vain.Otherwise the product runs smooth and fast.No hang,hiccups, by Gods grace still going smooth.Thanks for the retailer. All the best for him."
great product
"great camera, great battery life, best screen ive seen.great phone overall"
excelente
"I was immediately dissatisfied with my Galaxy S7 out of the box. The famous fast charger included is only for 'type G' outlets...the kind used in Malta, Cypress, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and parts of the UK with 3 plastic rectangular blades. It's useless to anyone in Europe or the US. And there is no US adapter included that will allow for fast charging. I'm using my old USB type c charger which takes about 4 hours for a full charge!!!Upon setup, I immediately realized that the wifi calling feature was disabled. After doing some research, I learned (from online android blogs, so keep the source in mind) that my phone is an Arab Emerites (UAE) version for which WiFi calling is unavailable, unlike other international versions sold in the UK and China. That will be a HUGE cost for me when traveling internationally.Finally, I'm only on my 3rd charge, but the battery life is nowhere near advertised. I had a 100% charge at 7:30am, and at 10am my battery is down to 66%. It will not go a whole day with moderate/heavy use. This is NOT the 2 day battery S7 sold in the USA....buyer beware."
Very good
I was surprised that the unit could only either take 1 sim card and one memory card or two sim cards. Really have to read the fine print these days to know what you're getting. :/
It's so good
Excelente celular. El dual sim me funciona perfecto. Totalmente recomendable
Totally satisfied with this purchase
The phone didnt start .
"I purchased this phone to replace my malfunctioning HTC One M7. At first glance I have to say the screen is gorgeous. I have watched youtube videos and other short clips and was amazed at the crisp color and motion. When taking photos, the pictures were nice. When I zoomed in on the phone I did start to notice some minor pixelation so I will most likely stick to my Sony DSLR if I really what to take distant shots. I have a few games that I play and the controls are seamless and react with un-noticeable delays. I have used the fingerprint login for my phone and other apps but I cant get it to consistently work. Calls are clear and I like the volume boost option although it is disabled for my bluetooth headphones. The battery life is fair with the phone running for a full day with wifi, bluetooth, location and mobile data each being on. There is also a battery save mode that will cause the phone to become grayscale and limit which apps can be open while preserving messaging and calling. That is a huge battery boost. Overall, I am highly impressed with this product and I am hopeful that it will last for many year to come."
"I was thinking to buy the best smartphone out there but the touch screen is not very responsive, the touch screen randomly doesn't react without pressing the screen which make me feel that the phone is very laggy.It seems that it is a common issue.:("
"I dislike that I was deceived thinking that I was purchasing a ""NEW"" phone. Item used and repackaged To be sold as ""NEW""."
Just excellent
"Can't turn on/charge after 1 day normal usage. Tried force reboot/safe mode, nothing happened. Should be a FAULTY phone.DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER"
"The package was open, Late shipment,Bag was torn,The seal was broken.I'll return it.No star et all."
"No problems at all, great phone."
All fine
"I was Worried because of the reviews they give to this provider of all the missing phones or damaged phones.but let me tell you that when I received this phone it was ""obviously unsealed"" but in excellent Status no dead pixel, exactly how it was described, because of the International Version I got one from South arabia or some Asian country so it came with manual and charger from that country.But the Phone works perfectly running all the latest Updates."
Phone is amazingly fast but there is something wrong with the battery life. I only have an estimated 8 hours at 80% charged. Not even enough battery to last half a day. Will be submitting for return.
everything perfect
"I ordered Samsung galaxy S7 edge factory unlock international middle east version single Sim card, but I got the wrong order, it is samsung galaxy S7 7edge Duos/ dual Sim."
"I bought this phone in June 16 and it has been a dream. However 3 months down the road, it is bricked. I got a Bootloader Error and Samsung UK refuses to repair the phone even if I want to pay for it.The only solution is to bring it to Samsung Asia to get it fixed or alternatively, jailbreak it so as to reset the phone.Either way I am left with a phone I cannot use and no means to get any sort of refund or warranty"
The phone arrived early. Sealed. Good condition. Great phone and I'm happy with it.
"Everything as expected, the description readed in reviews and on Samsung webpage, are pretty acurrate."
It seems that his is the best smartphone who was created in this period !
"Perfect! I got everything fast. The box was sealed, phone's excellent! Love it!!!"
returned because it came open the safety seal
It says the phone is not compatible with samsung pay? Why what is the issue
The package is empty.Whats Happened????? I need a explain!
Very fast shipping and very fast phone... Really great!
I upgraded to this phone from a Galaxy Note III and it is loads better - faster; better screen; much better camera (LOVE the camera). The display is so clear and colourful it is simply a joy to hold and behold. Any drawbacks? You do have to hold it carefully so you aren't pressing the wrap-around screen and confusing it with what you want to do. Worth it? you bet
Everything is OK with the phone.only the smart screen shot cant use.i don't know why.i tried a lot of time.
The phone is a phenomenal piece of equipment. I was a previous Note 5 user and have found this phone superior in every way. I only miss the stylus for performing detailed writing task but otherwise I love the speed and display. The battery life is quite good as well. It makes it through an entire day without having to be charged!
"another sim or microsd, you can't use two sims and the sd card at the same time"
Just greater Just great
Its gratis.
Incredible cellphone !!!
A good product
"Dual SIM unlocked (DUOS version, SM-935FD), awesome phone !Dual SIM capabilities were key to my purchase decision. This is an international version of the phone, comes carrier unlocked. I just popped my GSM / T-Mobile SIM card from my old phone (HTC One M8) into my new Samsung S7 Edge, and I was on the T-Mobile network in NYC. Do your research on LTE bands, but this phone has all the LTE bands that T-Mobile uses in the US, so I have great reception and 4G LTE available. I highly recommend for anyone who plans to do international travel to get this phone, instead of the carrier locked phones in the USA (no dual SIM available in the US)."
"To give a little back story about myself and phones, I'm that guy who has a new phone every few months. I don't break them, I just haven't been able to find something that I can get on board with for very long. This phone changes that.Pros:-Amazing battery life-Stellar performance from Samsung's exynos processor-Durable screen that is really hard to scratch or crack in general-Great rear camera with improved low-light performance over the S6-Rootable! *This is especially important to me or anyone that's really into android. This is why I no longer buy US variants of phones because carriers are making it more difficult to root and install custom ROM's-Really waterproof-SD expandabiltiy is back, as it should beCons--Edge is kinda annoying if you don't have a case. Your fingers will constantly press the sides of the screen and mess with what you are doing-No 64 or 128GB models for some reason. It's 2016 Samsung, only 32 GB?-Stock Samsung software is always atrocious in my opinion. This is why I use custom ROM's to get rid of most the pre-installed stuff-Lower camera resolution than the S6-Built in speaker sounds horrible after taking its first bath-Horrible to repairOverall, I do really like this phone still. I think I finally have found one that I will keep for some time now."
Great
"Clearly, the best cell I had so far"
The screen quality truly is fantastic and the camera is noticeably better than my family member's Iphones in tough lighting conditions. I had read the international version had a different graphics chip than US domestic. I don't know if its still true but I'm very satisfied.
Very good
Excellent
It is very intuitive and easy to use.
Why my cell phone is not same with picture of the back
Loved It !
Excellent phone. two thumps up
"Delivered on time, the best cell of all. Great screen, easy and comfortable handling. Great long lasting battery. Incredible pictures. Love my cell!!!!!"
awesome
"Ecxellent seller, high recommended"
I'm still seeing how it works for the Casio men`s
"I like the the phone so far. Specially for the battery, the charged time is much shorter now. The phone is arriving on time. thanks"
"perfect condition, exactly as described, seal was not broken awesome phone!!"
Great!!!!
Arrived on time and and as expected.
"so far, phone has being working excellently."
Great product! I am rediscovering a true smartphone
Everything ok
Perfect Product
Works great and looks even better. Got here very fast. Did have a little trouble when it was first opened trying to get it to English and not Chinese. Great choice from many different models.
just found out there is a recall on this phone. bought it as a present and have not opened it yet. trying to find out where to return
AFTER A MONTH OF USAGE THE SCREEN HAS BLURY BLACK LINES WHEN I CHANGE THE LIGHT TO LOW.
"Not as described - it is not equipment with ""Dual-core 2.15 GHz Kryo & dual-core 1.6 GHz Kryo"" (Snapdragon 820). This is the international version that is using a different CPU."
Amazing phone as I'm sure your aware. Taking off a star for its only problem which is the edges can be very annoying when you are holding it and it registers a touch at the side. This is its biggest problem that many people complain about. Possibly a deal breaking issue I would probably go with the s7 tbh if I was buying again. In terms of the international thing it's no big deal exactly the same except it comes with a foreign plug and they include an adapter which is nice. Everything was in English and phone setup went flawlessly. The Asia version is dual sim compatible which is the only difference from the EU version as far as I can tell and find online. So go for that one. Keep in mind it will only work on GSM carriers such as tmobile and at&the and nothe with CDMA like Verizon
Very good
The edge is a terrible design unless you hold your phone in the palm of your hand and never touch the sides.
"I received a fake phone. It doesn't even have a spot for the Sim Card, neither does it charges or turns on. Some S7 details are literally drawn on the plastic. It's just a piece of plastic on a Galaxy S7 shape."
Just as specified....excellent
liked it
Great looks and performance
By far the best phone I ever owned.
very good quality I really like works very wellI give 5 stars
It's a wonderful phone
Wrong chargerScreen problem
It's nice but there's something wrong with the LCD display.
So Good
"I've owned many different phones over the years. My first real smart phone was a Samsung S3 and was a great phone. I recently purchased this S7 Edge and can say it is the best phone I've ever had. I recommend getting the International version like mine. All the chatter about it on the Web is spot on. It is the fastest, smoothest, best of everything in a smart phone that money can buy today. My ONLY complaint is that TouchWiz needs more work. I really want to use it but ended up back to Nova launcher to get basic features, like vertical app drawer scroll and such. TouchWiz needs more features control to truly be useful. However this has nothing to do with how wonderful the S7 Edge International 935FD truly is!"
Great device!
Looks and work beautifully. Recommend to purchase from this vendor
"The phones arrived as described factory unlocked, unopened in new condition"
Love love my phone!
"Its a great phone, at first i was a little suspicious about this factory unlocked phone, but it turned out great!! dual SIM, easy to configure and overall great! its the best android phone out there so i highly recommended. it comes with everything listed and i checked the IMEI on the phone and the box and it matches. It does however come with the Europe charger but since i had the wireless charger from my S5 that wasnt an issue."
"It works very nicely, I had my concerns at first. And because of that it took me almost 3 months to decide on which option I should take."
It's nice
ok
what can i say??? greatest smartphone in market rigth now... cant complain on anything... it wonderful!
"After 5 month since I bought mobil phone, is gettting hot and have monitor problems"
Expected one Sims card received phone with two .What should I do now?
"Got this phone for 5 days, like it a lot. run smoothly, good looking, battery is good, as long as you know how to set your phone"
"This phone is giving me problems despite being two months in use! Unfortunately I experienced problems with it when the return date has elapsedFacebook App is not working, I tried to reload it so many times but in vainSometimes it switches its self offAnd the battery life is also not good"

Very satisfied ans so far so Great.
My phone is broken without drop and water.
I still want the same phone but the USA version of it! I discovered that i can't access so many things with this one in USA and the charger is also different from what we use here.I really need a quick assistance to get another one as replacement.thanks
All perfect
Shipped very fast. Box was sealed.. Only the English charger problem. Buy you can also find a converter for 2$.. Dual sim is working.. thanks.
Increíble!!!
It's good but after I bought then they have the recall for product.
Very Good!
Does not hold charge. Freezes a lot. Gets hated quickly. Wish I could give no star
It is a good phone.
I like the product because it is new and came before the estimated date. I am well please with my order.
"Well the phone rocks, in many aspects are better then i expected but after 4 weeks CAREFUL use i found a scratch at the screen... Its tiny almost not visible actually i can only feel it not see it but its there and have no clue how in heck happened.I just ordered something actually hate it, a screen protector, it supposed S7's screen being scratch proof right? Well isn't :-("
Great Phone! Love it
great phone. cool that it can fit 2 sims. now don't need to worry about loosing sim cards.
"Hi, i bought a samsung galaxy s7 edge when i was in u.s, it is just 2 weeks old and it is really working good, but when i went home to the philippines it is always hanging and should be turn off (by long press of lower volume button and lock button) so i can use it again, at first my phone turns off and the light on top kept open i was scared so i searched for that way of turning it on again.. the second time and the rest it keeps on hanging so i needed to turn it off again that way so it will open again.. it happens to me more than 10x.. it is kinda annoying at the same time make me worried to because im too far from the origin country of the phone... is it normal to happen when you buy your phone from other country and use it here in the philippines? Or is it really the fact that it has something wrong with my phone? Thanks for response!"
The perfect phone.Make the iPhone 6 look and feel like something of the past
excelllent
Love this phone
"Hated sending it back but this international version wouldn't work with TMo or ATT SIMs properly. Love the S7 Edge though. This dual SIM version wouldn't handle the two carriers cellular data properly. Once on wi-fi it would rarely transition to cell data without a reboot. Even then it didn't like two SIMs from different carriers. Suspect it is meant for two SIMs from the same carrier only. If I inserted a single SIM only, it worked better, but oddly my TMo SIM only got less than 1Mbps on band 12 LTE when the same SIM in a different phone pulled 15+Mbps consistently. ATT speeds when only 1 SIM inserted were consistent with other phones. If I can only use one SIM I might as well buy a single SIM US version so that wi-fi calling and VoLTE could work too, which they don't on this international version.Beyond the dual SIM issues, the Galaxy S7 Edge was a great phone. Awesome camera. Nice display."
awesome phone
"The seal arrived broken, the film protect was scratched and there was a dust between the display and film protection.The mobile is not a new one"
good
Unlocked for sure! Currently using it in Japan with a NTT Docomo chip. Tested the phone by playing music in the shower.
The phone didn't work
"I did quite a bit of research before buying a new smartphone. This phone is a bit pricey, but I decided to purchase it since it was one of the nicest phones that I seen. Also I knew that I would be taking good care of this device and would keep it for a while. I decided to purchase the international version that was unlocked so that I could select my GSM carrier. The phone was in excellent new condition with an adapter for US power supply. The phone is fast and I use the Wi-Fi router in my home for data usage to save on carrier costs. This is an excellent phone and I would highly recommend it."
"Product is good but easily Screen Cracked even was it in case and Samsung Service Center (in INDIA) is not able to replace screen(by paid service) as IEMI number is not visible in Theier system. Samsung Customer Support confirmed this will not be able to fixed in INDIA21-Aug-16: Increased One Start for Amazon , the customer support from Amazon is great and they are able me help."
What a great phone .I'm satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy phone...how could I put insurance on my phone
"I chose this model because it has two slots for nano sim, works perfect in Argentina , highly recommended ORIGINAL"
It a very nice phone
Love this phone. So fast and smooth. Lots of great features.
Ok. Good. Noticias excellent.
The seller was good at communication . The only problem was tht the seal looked liked tampered but the seller assurred me that it was a new mobile and the seal was broken to unlock the mobile . And you get only 1 month warranty which is bad . Overall the product is ok and running good
"LCD damaged within 2 months, it either flickers a lot or there is a green line a few pixels thick in the curved display.I wish it has stopped working within first month, at least in that case I could have returned the phone.And I handled the phone with utmost care, and yes no water testing or anything of that sort."
Love the phone!! .. I use it with AT&T and works without any problems.
My son loved it
Item was delivered just as advertised! Working just fine with 2 sim cards in Brazil!
the phone was as it was described.great phone.
"I love my phone. The phone is working as I would expect a Samsung smartphone to work.The color is amazing (the picture does not do the phone any justice), the weight and size are just right and the folks from Mobiles International, LLC, did an excellent job describing it.I highly recommend this company and I will definitely buy from them again!"
"another sim or microsd, you can't use two sims and the sd card at the same time"
Just greater Just great
"I was a bit dubious after reading a few of the negative reviews but found the phone which arrived to be in a sealed box and exactly as described on Amazon. I purchased from BREED and I am very happy with my new Samsung Galaxy S7 dual sim phone. The only downside was that it was a phone sourced from the United Arab Emirates which in itself is fine but the charger was for a UK type outlet, easily fixed with a US plug adapter."
great phone great service
FINE
All was excelent
Dood jop
"This phone is awesome never had a better phone battery life is absolutely amazing and don't worry this is NOT A FAKE I checked it and my box came brand new, new seal not broken like some people say but the only downside is it comes with a UK charger it's no big deal they include a U.S adapter with the package and my fast charging works just great so no need to go out and buy another charger just make sure u get a good case I have the speck candy shell I recommend it and I have no edge touch issues with a case on"
"I've had this for about 4 months now. I totally love how sleek it feels. Really premium piece of machine. But you need a good case, it feels that fragile. I've had a Samsung phone for over 4 years so using this was no difficult task. Nothing too surprising. There are things I don't use much though....such as the edge screen. Though the night clock really works well for me. It does seem to be waterproof but I will not willingly test that. But I notice I can still use the interface with droplets on the screen. This was not the case with my previous phone. It is still fairly new so the speed is great. Battery life is awesome. I can confidently leave home without the charger for an entire day of heavy use. No overheating. Overall, good purchase. I would buy it again but I have no intention of losing or destroying it and I don't plan on splurging on another upgrade for the next 2-3years. I hung onto my S4 for that long."
"Very good experience with this phone but it came with a cosmetic damage located at the back near the camera, looking like a small paint stain underneath the glass. Which doesn't really mather as it's in a case all the time."
We bought this S7 Edge to use it in Argentina (Movistar network) and it works perfectly well!
Excellent cell phone I am using two SIMs from México without problemsHighly recommended
"S7 edge is an excellent phone, but the seal was broken (hence opened). And I can't download Samsung Pay from Google play store!! Which is a big disappointment! It shows that Samsung Pay isn't compatible with this device!"
"it is no doubt that s7 edge is a good phone,but it is opened by someone,the seal is broken.and i can't download Samsung Pay from Google play store. it shows that Samsung Pay doesn't compatible with this device."
"Back glass got cracked after half a day of use - I didn't even drop the phone - just got it hit the door in the pocket of my hoody. Probably it's not about the phone itself, but about this particular vendor - I've heard there are models on sale with cheaper back. The packaging was strange as well - for international version I would expect something different from singaporian plug."
Arrived timely manner.Great product.
The best phone in the world
All ok
excellent
Loving this phone more and more
good
"Came perfect, works great, and is so beautiful. I had no problems with switching my sim card over to this. I am so in love with this phone. It's beautiful, amazing and takes phenomenal photos. It's so beautiful."
I really like this product. It's so powerfull.
I like it. ... :D
"Excellent product. Work on all gsm networks around the world. In USA works great with AT&T and T-Mobile. My comes with UK ac adapter, if you want to use at another countries you need to buy an appropriate Ac adapter."
Excelent!! The box was sealed really new in perfect condition. Congratulation!!
Its great and beautiful. FYI the origin seal region is Arab Emirates and it cannot use Samsung pay.
I received the item with Broken seal.
"An excellent phone in every way possible, feels very sturdy and premium when held in your hand."
Very sharp picture and display. The edge makes the picture looks 3D. The slippery glass face does not give me any problem about finger smudge as some people said on internet. However because the glass is slippery so you better get a protective cover not only to protect it but also prevent it from slipping out of your hand.
"Can't put a screen protector on it. Dropped it and it shattered. Now it is useless. Do not buy. I had the screen replaced, 1 month later, a pink vertical line appeared for a day, now the screen is black and won't do anything. DO NOT BUY!!!"
I got tons of compliments over this phone. They kept asking me where on earth and how did I got a pink phone. So far I'm loving it. Thank you
Love it!! No one has the coral so when I took it to AT&T to get my phone set up the were shocked I had it!! It's worth getting it syncs right up with my hearing aids just fine and with my car perfectly and it doesn't stay locked once it connects with your car so u are completely hands free!! Love the fact the rain will not ruin my phone since I work a lot outside!!
"Perfect, exactly as described and without any issues."
Excellent!
"disappointed, phone developed 3 grey lines across screen after two months and no mishandling of device"
"It's wonderful, exactly what I needed"
muy buen producto
Works very well in Africa - Unlocked
"My phone dead, don't know why? Can't not turn on at all"
every thing went fine according to expectation.
"best phone i had so far, love it"
"Very good telephone with lots of features. I have the dual sim card, and it operates nicely... pictures are great.Only drawback, the dual sim uses the same space for the dual sim and for the memory expansion slot."
Love it.
Very good
Excellent
"excellent product,works great"
Very good mobile
Cheap flimsy quality.
great phone
"As expected, arrived on time and working perfectly with 2 Simms"
"Had to get rid of my Galaxy Note 7 due to the well publicized issues. Replaced it with the S7 edge. Nice phone but NOT as functional. No Stylus, No screen scroll capture, smaller screen. In general, an ok temporary replacement but SAMSUNG has better get something on the market that has the Galaxy Note 7 features (without the meldtowns)."
Everything ok!!!
"Do not purchase. Bought this phone a few months ago and now I have a row of dead pixels. Never dropped or had water damage. It was fine in the morning and when I took it out of my pocket, I noticed the pixels died. For me, it goes away randomly and always returns in an hour or so."
"Can't turn on/charge after 1 day normal usage. Tried force reboot/safe mode, nothing happened. Should be a FAULTY phone.DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER"
"The package was open, Late shipment,Bag was torn,The seal was broken.I'll return it.No star et all."
"I FIRST EXPERIENCE ONLINE PHONE ORDERBUT REALY GOOD EXCELLENT, I M HAPPY WITH AMAZON SHOPING, AND I REALY LIKE AMAZON SHIPPING ORDER TRACKING SYSTEM."
The phone is exactly wath i expected! The only thing that i can't test if it work in Romania! In rest the phone is awesome!
"Amazing. Been using it for the past few months now. No scratches, no shatters. Perfect. Performance is fast. I dig it."
nice phone I love it
Excellent product.
"This phone appears to be exact same phone as sold in US, but the seller did include a simple plug adaptor so you can plug it into 110 v in US. Otherwise, the plug it comes with looks like the plug they use in Spain households. The phone is Duel Sim card and unlocked, but what itsn't stated is that you can have 2 SIM cards OR, 1 SIM card and 1 microSD card (which I put a 128 GB card in). I expecting it to allow all 3 at the same time. No biggy though.The phone itself looks Spectacular and the screen seems to kind of repel dust, to some extent (I baby the phone, in general). The graphics are great. I haven't registered for Samsung Pay yet, but this phone appears to allow it OK. The battery seems pretty good, and it charges VerY fast!!Also, I had apple iphone before this, and would say this is, so far, quite a bit nicer than the iphone 5 or 6. I would recommend to anyone concerned about switching from Apple to Samsung......Also, one thing that made the change Super easy was that the phone had a very small gadget in the box that allows anyone with an Apple to hook up to the new phone and it will automatically download ALL of your photos, videos and complete set of Contacts.....that was a huge relief, and that's why I hadn't changed in past. Would highly recommend the Galaxy S7 Edge. Hope this info helpful!!"
"Beware of this product guys: I bought this unlocked Samsung Galaxy phone. It is not fully compatible with T-Mobile and I am assuming that AT&T and other carriers will be the same. Important features like LTE support and wifi calling will not work. Moreover, Samsung USA does not support this phone. They asked me to talk their Asian counterparts for any issue. All in all, its waste of money."
"WARNING!! this is a fake cellphone, don't buy"
I wish there was an outer box for these phone
Legit seller New Sealed Galaxy S7 Dual SIM as PromisedThank you
i received your device and was excellent thanks a lot
"Great phone, just as it was hyped/ reviewed by the many tech and phone experts out there. Would recommend it to anyone looking for the best overall phone out there right now."
Awesome. With russian language. 100% official. Love it!
Perfect phone. fast and beautiful
"The Best phone in market at this moment!7 reasons to buy it:1. Most beautiful design in the world2. SuperAMOLED display3. Camera is the best (12mpx, Opt.stab bla bla bla...)4. IP68 waterproof5. Wireless charge, quick charge6. Always on dislpay7. Memory 32Gb (DualSim/MicrSD up to 200Gb)"
"WTF This is should be an International Asia Version .I have a Verizon unlocked !!! Tell me why !!And the first page , shows that somebody has already set up the phone !look at the photos,please. the phone was Sold by: TechnoMaster"
"Good products, good service, excellent price."
"Good battery life, good camera, amazing features."
Very good
I was surprised that the unit could only either take 1 sim card and one memory card or two sim cards. Really have to read the fine print these days to know what you're getting. :/
I started to see a bright pink line of the screen which wouldn't disappear. I have been maintaining the product with no impact. Shame!
Very Good phone
this is an amazing phone. best i have ever owned.
"Good buy.Months now.The retailer is too good and had a prompt follow up.The only one issue still haunting me is the charging time,it takes 2-3 hrs to charge from 0-50%.The retailer even send me a new charger free ,which didn't help me.i bought a wireless Samsung charger too ,but in vain.Otherwise the product runs smooth and fast.No hang,hiccups, by Gods grace still going smooth.Thanks for the retailer. All the best for him."
great product
"great camera, great battery life, best screen ive seen.great phone overall"
excelente
"I was immediately dissatisfied with my Galaxy S7 out of the box. The famous fast charger included is only for 'type G' outlets...the kind used in Malta, Cypress, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and parts of the UK with 3 plastic rectangular blades. It's useless to anyone in Europe or the US. And there is no US adapter included that will allow for fast charging. I'm using my old USB type c charger which takes about 4 hours for a full charge!!!Upon setup, I immediately realized that the wifi calling feature was disabled. After doing some research, I learned (from online android blogs, so keep the source in mind) that my phone is an Arab Emerites (UAE) version for which WiFi calling is unavailable, unlike other international versions sold in the UK and China. That will be a HUGE cost for me when traveling internationally.Finally, I'm only on my 3rd charge, but the battery life is nowhere near advertised. I had a 100% charge at 7:30am, and at 10am my battery is down to 66%. It will not go a whole day with moderate/heavy use. This is NOT the 2 day battery S7 sold in the USA....buyer beware."
"The screen broke and began showing stripes after a month (hardware defect). Possibly related, the battery also needs to be recharged 2-3 times a day with moderate usage (no video or downloads, background apps closed). Judging by the other reviews, this retailer is fine with selling faulty and fraudulent products. Do NOT buy from this retailer."
Awesome phone
Its gratis.
Incredible cellphone !!!
A good product
"Dual SIM unlocked (DUOS version, SM-935FD), awesome phone !Dual SIM capabilities were key to my purchase decision. This is an international version of the phone, comes carrier unlocked. I just popped my GSM / T-Mobile SIM card from my old phone (HTC One M8) into my new Samsung S7 Edge, and I was on the T-Mobile network in NYC. Do your research on LTE bands, but this phone has all the LTE bands that T-Mobile uses in the US, so I have great reception and 4G LTE available. I highly recommend for anyone who plans to do international travel to get this phone, instead of the carrier locked phones in the USA (no dual SIM available in the US)."
"To give a little back story about myself and phones, I'm that guy who has a new phone every few months. I don't break them, I just haven't been able to find something that I can get on board with for very long. This phone changes that.Pros:-Amazing battery life-Stellar performance from Samsung's exynos processor-Durable screen that is really hard to scratch or crack in general-Great rear camera with improved low-light performance over the S6-Rootable! *This is especially important to me or anyone that's really into android. This is why I no longer buy US variants of phones because carriers are making it more difficult to root and install custom ROM's-Really waterproof-SD expandabiltiy is back, as it should beCons--Edge is kinda annoying if you don't have a case. Your fingers will constantly press the sides of the screen and mess with what you are doing-No 64 or 128GB models for some reason. It's 2016 Samsung, only 32 GB?-Stock Samsung software is always atrocious in my opinion. This is why I use custom ROM's to get rid of most the pre-installed stuff-Lower camera resolution than the S6-Built in speaker sounds horrible after taking its first bath-Horrible to repairOverall, I do really like this phone still. I think I finally have found one that I will keep for some time now."
Great
"Clearly, the best cell I had so far"
The screen quality truly is fantastic and the camera is noticeably better than my family member's Iphones in tough lighting conditions. I had read the international version had a different graphics chip than US domestic. I don't know if its still true but I'm very satisfied.
Excelente
Product was received as advertised. Very pleased with delivery time.
"Outstanding phone. Great features and the curved edge is great. Haven't had issues with this beauty. Most complaints I do not understand, unless they have personal problems. I've attached photo of the adapter that comes with it."
One of the best phones I've ever used. Got the Asian variant. Everything works well. Perfect condition.
"Great phone, so far I have used it in Canada as well as the states. Will see how it works in Europe next. My only gripe is losing one of the sim cards to the SD card for expanded memory. There is a hack for this but I haven't done it yet. It involves sticking the sim chip to the back of the SD card to have a dual slot."
"It's a shame that you have to choose between placing SIM2 or MicroSD. In previous versions of DUOS you could use SIM1, SIM2 and MicroSD simultaneously."
"The most ugly phone on the high end market. Ugly oblong shape, cheap shiny plastic look, ugly design of icons, oversaturated colors even in basic mode, and messy organization of apps and screens. Extra features like pulse sensing have marginal value at best. Good features: dual simm, large screen size to phone size ratio, low weight, waterproofing do not fully compensate for ugly design. Given a chance I would go for any other phone, especially HTC."
Fast and responsive
"Excellent phone, well worth the money over the S7 due to the larger screen. This is not a fake, it is the real deal. The phone I received is an international version (dual sim) from the UAE. It came with a UK charging plug."
"Chose an 'international' model, so I can use while stationed in China and USA... actually, I loved it for 2 months, then it developed a problem which i learned was common, thick gray bars on the screen, and which should easily and clearly be under Samsung's warranty, however I have discovered that the warranty is only good in Singapore, and nowhere outside Singapore. Wasted time on the phone with Singapore, and finally learned that I am out of luck, need to pay to get it repaired. So, BEWARE!!!!!!! I am screwed with a $700.00 POS."
"Everything as expected, the description readed in reviews and on Samsung webpage, are pretty acurrate."
It seems that his is the best smartphone who was created in this period !
It is very intuitive and easy to use.
Why my cell phone is not same with picture of the back
Loved It !
Excellent phone. two thumps up
"Delivered on time, the best cell of all. Great screen, easy and comfortable handling. Great long lasting battery. Incredible pictures. Love my cell!!!!!"
awesome
"Ecxellent seller, high recommended"
I'm still seeing how it works for the Casio men`s
"all very correct, fast , good priducto ."
"I bought mine from NPG USA Store, was shipped from hong kong but everything looks great. Works fine, a adaptor was also included with the phone."
It's so good
Excelente celular. El dual sim me funciona perfecto. Totalmente recomendable
Totally satisfied with this purchase
The phone didnt start .
"I purchased this phone to replace my malfunctioning HTC One M7. At first glance I have to say the screen is gorgeous. I have watched youtube videos and other short clips and was amazed at the crisp color and motion. When taking photos, the pictures were nice. When I zoomed in on the phone I did start to notice some minor pixelation so I will most likely stick to my Sony DSLR if I really what to take distant shots. I have a few games that I play and the controls are seamless and react with un-noticeable delays. I have used the fingerprint login for my phone and other apps but I cant get it to consistently work. Calls are clear and I like the volume boost option although it is disabled for my bluetooth headphones. The battery life is fair with the phone running for a full day with wifi, bluetooth, location and mobile data each being on. There is also a battery save mode that will cause the phone to become grayscale and limit which apps can be open while preserving messaging and calling. That is a huge battery boost. Overall, I am highly impressed with this product and I am hopeful that it will last for many year to come."
"I was thinking to buy the best smartphone out there but the touch screen is not very responsive, the touch screen randomly doesn't react without pressing the screen which make me feel that the phone is very laggy.It seems that it is a common issue.:("
"I dislike that I was deceived thinking that I was purchasing a ""NEW"" phone. Item used and repackaged To be sold as ""NEW""."
Just excellent
Excelente
"Beautiful device, smooth operation but battery life is a huge disappointment. 3 hours max before recharge needed with heavy use"
"Perfect! I got everything fast. The box was sealed, phone's excellent! Love it!!!"
returned because it came open the safety seal
It says the phone is not compatible with samsung pay? Why what is the issue
The package is empty.Whats Happened????? I need a explain!
Very fast shipping and very fast phone... Really great!
I upgraded to this phone from a Galaxy Note III and it is loads better - faster; better screen; much better camera (LOVE the camera). The display is so clear and colourful it is simply a joy to hold and behold. Any drawbacks? You do have to hold it carefully so you aren't pressing the wrap-around screen and confusing it with what you want to do. Worth it? you bet
Everything is OK with the phone.only the smart screen shot cant use.i don't know why.i tried a lot of time.
The phone is a phenomenal piece of equipment. I was a previous Note 5 user and have found this phone superior in every way. I only miss the stylus for performing detailed writing task but otherwise I love the speed and display. The battery life is quite good as well. It makes it through an entire day without having to be charged!
"While my Galaxy S7 Edge order was in transit, I asked this seller (Wireless Place and/or TechnoMaster, not sure what the name story is there) whether this shipped with a USA A/C outlet power adapter (2 flat prongs), or the international adapter (2 round prongs, spaced further apart). They promptly replied that it ships with the latter/international, and added that they'd send me a USA adapter, for free... it arrived 4 days after the phone arrived. Nice.But I found that I was not getting Samsung's ""Quick Charge"" feature, which touts ""Fast battery charging: 60% in 30 min (Quick Charge 2.0)."" Yes, I did have Settings > Fast Cable Charging enabled, and no there was no ""Fast Charging: XX%"" popup message when connecting to A/C power. The phone was only estimating, and achieving, only about 1% charge increase per 2 minutes. I messaged this seller and told of the problem, to which they replied:""this is very normal that the last 30% or so takes a longer time to charge. the phone takes around 2 to 3 hours to charge and that is normal. mine does exactly the same thing. i suggest you do a hard reset but i am sure if you get another S7 that is the same you will get the same result. thanks""I'd already researched this ""common S7 problem"", and resolved it. It turned out the ""Samsung Adaptive Fast Charging"" USA power adapter this seller sent me for free, was fake/counterfeit-- it DID WORK to charge at normal (slow) speed, but DIDN'T WORK for the Quick Charge 2.0 feature, despite having all the right markings. The fake was noticeably lighter weight; different shape; the text color was darker, and the specs side of it was quite different, compared to the genuine (international version) Samsung A/C adapter which came with the S7.Resolution was my buying a simple International-to-USA A/C power outlet adapter, and using it with the (genuine) Samsung Adaptive Fast Charging adapter which came with the phone, with its included USB cable.So this seller did deliver exactly what I ordered; a genuine Galaxy S7 Edge with genuine Samsung Adaptive Fast Charging adapter & USB cable... all on time, so no grievance there. And I can give them the benefit of the doubt as not knowing that the USA A/C adapter they sent me for FREE (above/beyond the call of duty), was in fact fake/counterfeit. Where they disappointed was in their reply to my followup query about Quick Charge not working, telling me only that the slow charging rate (about 2 mins per 1% increase) I was getting, was normal/proper; meanwhile their own S7 Edge product page touts the standard Quick Charge 2.0 feature. I did reply to this seller explaining the (fake Samsung USA adapter) problem and my resolution, including the pic attachments here, but I heard no further reply from them. So ""No Harm No Foul"" with this seller; but if I hadn't done my own research and resolved the Quick Charge problem, I'd be living with slow charging only."
Loving it
Switched from iPhone 6 ... so much better!!!
Way better than i expected.The battery is the best that I ever saw.
Dual SIM International Version!
"Everything you've read about this phone is true. It is amazing. The screen is second only to the S7 (in terms of ppi), the camera is arguably the best on the market, and it is a monster in battery life and performance. Silver Titanium is undoubtedly the best color. Absolutely stunning. If Samsung found a way to implement stereo audio, it would be perfect, but it makes up for what it lacks in sound quality in its relative loudness and top of the line headphone output. Rest assured that you are buying the best phone on the market right now.--------------------------------Compliment it with a Spigen Neo Hybrid Crystal (I 100% recommend Gunmetal for a Silver Titanium GS7 Edge): http://amzn.com/B01AUORACQand a Armorsuit Case Friendly Screen Shield: http://amzn.com/B01ACXSKAG"
Great
I got my new galaxy s7 duos and the package came on time and good status.
Excellent
Package received without the actual phone which was probably stolen on the way
"Very nice phone except for a MAJOR problem with DUAL SIM operation. The reason for a Dual Sim phone is for the purpose of staying ""connect"" in a fast paced world. This phone does not allow you to have Mobile Data available when both Sims are active, it simply shuts off when both sims are selected. Between T-Mobile and Samsung, the problem could not be resolved. The answer was ""just have ONE SIM active and Mobile Data will work"". Wrong reason for me when I have 3 Asus phones working perfectly fine with Dual sim operation on T-Mobile. VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED."
Excellent product.
"No problems at all, great phone."
All fine
"I was Worried because of the reviews they give to this provider of all the missing phones or damaged phones.but let me tell you that when I received this phone it was ""obviously unsealed"" but in excellent Status no dead pixel, exactly how it was described, because of the International Version I got one from South arabia or some Asian country so it came with manual and charger from that country.But the Phone works perfectly running all the latest Updates."
Phone is amazingly fast but there is something wrong with the battery life. I only have an estimated 8 hours at 80% charged. Not even enough battery to last half a day. Will be submitting for return.
everything perfect
"I ordered Samsung galaxy S7 edge factory unlock international middle east version single Sim card, but I got the wrong order, it is samsung galaxy S7 7edge Duos/ dual Sim."
"I bought this phone in June 16 and it has been a dream. However 3 months down the road, it is bricked. I got a Bootloader Error and Samsung UK refuses to repair the phone even if I want to pay for it.The only solution is to bring it to Samsung Asia to get it fixed or alternatively, jailbreak it so as to reset the phone.Either way I am left with a phone I cannot use and no means to get any sort of refund or warranty"
The phone arrived early. Sealed. Good condition. Great phone and I'm happy with it.
Had this for a few months now and can't be happier with it. A great phone.
phone worked as expected and was brand new. No complains happy with the purchase
Good
"All good, product (s7), delivering (Amazon.com)"

It cannot make three way calling so I have returned it to them. When you add a call the merge does not come.
My screen shows grey lines
great phone

I need a different pawer plug
"after looking at different models and the companies for the s7 and many reviews, i was VERY skeptical about purchasing one online. Let me say this phone is AWESOME !! I recieved my phone within a few days, sooner than expected and NGP did keep me updated about my purchase. This phone was easy to set up, has everything i'll ever need and more and easy to use. Unbelievable phone... I'm VERY happy with my purchase !"
ok
"Im going to compare the Galaxy s7 Edge to my past phone whitch was the Galaxy s6, to begin i must say that both phones are the best ive ever had, with that said the this phone is much bigger than my s6, 5.5 inch with them sexy edges.. Im using this phone with Metro PCS in Atlanta GA and the signal seems to be the same with my old phone ( will update later if needed).Now the battery is a 3600 mah compared to the 2550 mah in the s6...if i remember correctly. I can get up to 2 days with one charge and low to mid usage.....power users can het at least one full day. So why did i get this phone.....3 resons..1st= the return of micro sd, nkw i can finally put lost of content with no worries, on the s6 i had only 32 gigs, on this one it has 32 gigs but i just ordered a 200 gig sd to put in this bad boy....2nd= the size.....yes 5.5 inch is just right....at least for me, and in size the battery just like i mentioned before.....and 3rd= the water resistance, although not needed its great to have, i work for a painting companie and we handle water every day, from washing rollers, brushes, to power washing houses, so this feature is nice to have. As for the shippment the phone was in awesome conditions....well it was new so it had to..... will update in the future after i get more usage out of it."
Is so damn beautiful
excellent product.....
Great product and very good seller. Thanks.
Do not buy this phone. It has manufacturer defect. A pink vertical line will form and Samsung will not fix it if the phone is the international version. Been a fan of Samsung for a long time but they just lost a customer.[...]

Over heating
This is a fantastic device. Works well in my country and costs $350 less than in my country. I know you won't believe it but it is a sad fact.
Great phone! Everything I use so far is good.Unblocked version it's so better than cell comapnies version because you save a lot of time non uninstalling app that you'll never use
The screen broke the first time I tried to use it.
A complete garbage! ! ! Don't buy it! You will lose a big amount of money! . After 2 month the screen became complete black. I contacted the seller and he said that the warranty with them was just for one month but he told me that I had one year of warranty with Samsung. .... I tried to contact to Samsung warranty in United States and in my country (Argentina ) and they both said that the year of warranty was only with the country where the phone was manufactured (Vietnam. ....seriously? ??)Well I wasted almost uss 700 in a phone that after 2 months stopped working and the only solution that I have gotten was to fly to Vietnam or spend uss 330 more tax to fix it in a no official cellphone center of technical support
I love my new cel phone.Fer
perfect

"Everything is good. Would be amazing, if my microphone worked though. Supermely annoying I can't make calls. Would have gotten a 5 star but because of this problem UT gets one"
OK
The best phone ever. Great camera. Buy it.
phone would not work unless plugged into the charger and its got an internal battery so i had to return it brand new phone
Work with metropcs YEAH
It's awesome. Using it now to type this
It's perfect!!
It is easy usage.
It met my expectations
"The best phone you will ever have, can handle many applications in background and it still responds as expected, zero lags and the curved screen is the best.The phone came with the AC adaptor as it's for Africa but I had no problems at all, the quick charge is just amazing and the battery lasts the whole day (5am to 11pm) with no need to additional battery charges.Go for the gold version it's the most classy one. Some photos that I took they look so real. Enjoy!"
"Original, reliable."
"I really like the phone, but nobody mentioned that Samsung Pay does not work with this, the international version - I had to call Samsung Support to find that out.. disappointed and send it back for that reason..."
"excellent product, highly recommendedClosed box wine"
Samsung> Iphone
Love Samsung phone and tablets
This phone is really fast and there is no lag for multitasking.
It is working fine just like the seller descrived
This phone is absolutely amazing. Everyday I learn something new about it. Amazing
I was nervous about purchasing an international version of this phone but I'm happy I did. I actually owned a US AT&T version prior to this model and I can confirm the following after several days of use and testing:1) The International version has the faster Exynos 8890 vs Snapdragon 820.2) Battery life appears to be better than the Snapdragon 820 US model.3) No problems with AT&T LTE 4G.4) No AT&T bloatware!So far I highly recommend it!

Best Galaxy ever. Amazing.
"Updating my review. I specifically ordered the LATAM version as I work in South America. Constant connection drops and errors on my home network in Peru (Claro). Claro has replaced my SIM twice and the problems still arise. Couldn't connect in Ecuador on a standard GSM network that my S5 had connected to for years. Guatemala, couldn't hold a connection either that my S5 had used for years as well. I have a $700 top of the line network only device. Thankfully I still have my S5. I would not trust this seller to send you the specific version you need for your region."
"Dropped once, front and back completely shattered, >300$ repair costNot only did the front and back glass spiderweb after a single drop, the phone itself started glitching and now it won't even turn on. Apparently dropping it voids the warranty so now I have a 600$ paperweight. This will be my final Samsung phone."
Good.
Yes. Everything was perfect . Thanks
Birthday gift for my brother. He loved it too death.
"so far so good,loving the phone,genuine and clean"
I got this phone and it was not working properly. I called and spoke with a representative and he stated he would send out another phone but never did and I waited a week then had to call back and get another phone. The screen stopped working.
Hi thereI ordered this samsung galaxy s7 on jun 17 nd everything was very very great until 2 week ago i just realized that in the screen there is one pixel wrong. Is almost imperseptible but if you focus on this pixel you can see how s*** it looks like
Techno master always send products that after 2 weeks you start seeing the defects. It has happened twice in less than 2 months.
"DO NOT TRUST this product on this seller.I bought TWO WEEKS AGO and the device showed:1.) problems with fingerprint lock. Basically this feature adds 30 seconds of waiting time before using your phone, since it consistenly does not work, and it locks your phone after 3 tries.2.) Phone would consistenly freeze (once a day) with the watch on. The only solution is restaring the phone. and the freezed clock is an extra because it made me lose a few meetings.3.) ""unbreakle glass"" screen broke after ONE WEEK OF USE, in my FRONT pocket, without never even even falling on the flor. it was ONE SINGLE coin that made the damage."
"My husband and I bought these as an upgrade from our previous Galaxy S5s. I got the rose gold and he got the black one. The rose gold color wasn't as rosy as I thought it would be, it's more of a champagne color. The black one looks very sophisticated and elegant. I must say that I was not a fan of Samsung borrowing Apple's idea of no memory storage and making it difficult to put the sim card in but it was an easy fix with being able to send all of my extra photos to my Samsung account. Upon arrival, the packaging makes sure the product is not harmed whatsoever (lots and lots of bubble wrap). In all honesty I was afraid the phone was not going to hold up very long because of the glass edge and because I'm prone to dropping my phone...a lot. However even with out a case it has held up quite well. The photo quality of the front and rear camera is amazing, definitely a step (or two) up from the S5. We decided to buy on amazon because the price listed was $200-$300 cheaper than buying in stores, plus free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime. All in all I would highly reccommend this phone if you're a Samsung lover like myself."
LED screen started to flash in and out and show a blue screen after 3 weeks. Battery is already over heating after 3 weeks of use. Battery life sucks.
Inserted AT&T and works absolutely fine.Great phone.
"I bought the cellphone as gift for my brother, and to honest, he's really happy.Service was really good, I'm really satisfied about the product and also the serviceGood job!"
I love it
CAME WITH A WRONG CHARGER FOR EUROPE VERSION
You have background colors in it but the second one that I received it worked perfect
"Hi guys, I am using my new Galaxy S7 Edge about 1 1/2 month, and your charger stop working, this device have some kind of warranty? i am currently living in Ecuador.Regards."
I love my phone. Good condition. Beautiful. And not too expensive for this item. Thank you.
Good product.
Love my new phone
"Excellent Smartphone. Great Camera, Awesome for multimedia."
"Incompatible with AT&T, no 4G reception"
Solid phone
Received product excellent phone.
This phone is manufactured for Asia market so if you live outside Asia you will not have it fixed by Samsung in you country!
very good
"very good product and perfect delivery, thanks"
Excelent phone
"Bought this specifically because I wanted the Exynos processor instead of the Snapdragon and so that I can root if I wanted to. I'm on T-Mobile US and did my research to ensure that my bands are supported - which they all are except for some 3G. I bought this phone from a seller named 'lifeline###' and the box the phone came in had the factory seal. As another reviewer pointed out, my phone originated from the United Arab Emirates so this came with a non-US friendly charge adapter and the manual appears to be in English & Arabic. In any case, the phone is great working order and I was able to just pop in my T-Mobile SIM card with no configuration needed, nor a visit to the T-Mobile store!I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 so all I had was the regular charging block which doesn't support the fast charge. I went ahead and purchased the Aukey QC 3.0 block and I'm fast charging away!"
Be aware that black translucent lines may appear across the screen even after very short period of usage.
"It has meet my expectations, thank you however the battery life can be improved a little more."
"Best phone I've had yet. really happy with it. Very fast, the battery lasts very long and the camera is really really good. Whenever my friends take pictures they always ask for my phone because the camera is just so much better. If you're an adroid person and you're looking for your flagship phone, don't look any further.If you're in the USA, this comes with a default European adapter plug and US converter."
The phone meets all expectations. It's excellent. I Love It.
"The build quality is excellent, on par with Apples external build quality.This devices edge design makes looking at the screen much more interesting, and less ""flat"". It is similar to looking into a slight bubble. The buttons are very tactile, and the fingerprint sensor and it's controlling software work well.Samsung's TouchWiz implementation on top of Android 6.0.1 raises no real complaint from me. I do not use their ""Edge UI"", but it can be fully disabled easily."
every thing is ok
definitely unlocked and works well in my country.
"I live in the UK, but had this delivered to a friend's address while I completed a road trip from Miami to San Francisco. The delivered product was well packaged and was originally intended for the Middle East market. A big bonus for me is that the supplied charger uses a UK-style 3-pin plug. While hardly a big deal as I, like most people, have the world's supply of USB power adapters. Considering that this purchase has saved me quite a bit of cash over outright purchase in the UK, I'm very happy.Powering up the phone for the first time shows a single application for the intended market which was deleted as I have no use for it. I've owned Android phones previously, but have been using an iPhone 6 Plus for the last year. I've since fallen out of love with iOS as it's just too inflexible and is becoming somewhat childish in terms of interface. Samsung's implementation of the Android platform is smooth, highly-polished and commendable. It's not as fast as the pure product in the Nexus lineup, but does not suffer as all as a result.The octacore processor in the non-US model is just pure sweeping power. It's a good thing that the battery is a hefty 3500mAh unit or it wouldn't last the day. That said, if you're the kind of user who has multiple applications running all day long - and I'm among that userbase - this phone will take it all in its stride and not break a sweat. The screen is absolutely beautiful without being too highly saturated, the cameras (both front and back) are immensely capable and the return of expandable storage through cheap and capacious micro-SD cards is very welcome.Physically, the phone is svelte, lightweight and sits in the hand beautifully. Even without a case, there's no feeling that you'll drop it at any moment. One of the finest physical features is the waterproofing that doesn't require that you slap chunks of rubber into the ports to maintain its integrity. no more panics when you're caught in that torrential downpour about your phone suffering a premature demise.I haven't tried any of the included accessories such as the micro-USB cable, charger or earbuds as I already have very high quality 3rd-party versions. From the look of them, they appear to be reasonable quality.For anyone in the US who's concerned about losing out on network connectivity by using a phone from an overseas market, rest assured. I used a SIM card linked to T-Mobile's 4G network and had absolutely no issue anywhere with obtaining a good strong 4G signal. The Exynos processor in the US market model, while likely perfectly adequate, will almost certainly be that touch slower than the beast in the overseas market product.If you're like me, fear running out of power when you're away out all day and carry a power bank, know that the quick charge 2 feature has this from about 5% to fully charged in around an hour. The genuine Samsung quick charge puck may be slower to re-add the juice, but it's utterly convenient when you're a tired and then don't have to worry about not quite plugging the phone in to charge.If you're seeking to buy a phone without the burden of a contract, do yourself a big favour: Save some money, get this model, use one of the probably five or six wall chargers you already have and enjoy this incredible handset. It may be coming from outside of the US, but it's delivered quickly and I have no doubt whatsoever that it'll be loved every bit as I love mine. This is the best phone I've ever had, and the added bonus of saving on the cost of purchasing outright through Best Buy, etc is the icing on an already very delicious cake."
Got horizontal lines on display within few days of usage. Unable to return it because the timeline to return has expired :(

excellent
"The phone is amazing! the screen is simply the best on the market right now. I read different comments about unreliable sellers selling fake or refurbished phones. I was lucky I bought mine from seller, theCoos. Got the phone new as described without problem."
"AWESOME phone. Came prepackaged, sealed, Turned on in English. There was an Arabic file of some sort - which I deleted. The model number matches correctly. No issues or problems getting it going and activated. Took it to my local AT&T store for the sim card and it took a little extra time and a couple of restarts, but after that everything is working great. I'm still learning some of the little tricks that come with it. The cell coverage shows ""4G"", not ""4GLTE"". I don't know the difference. The ATT guy said some would say it was better, LOL. I have no idea but, whatever. There are a few pre-installed samsung/google things. Smart Switch uploaded many things, but some things like ringtones were not backed up. I had to go looking for them. In the process, I also discovered some new ones. Battery is doing just fine and lasts as expected. It has it's own Samsung factory warranty - 1 year. I haven't been able to find any way to tell for sure if this is the snapdragon or xynos processor, but as I stated earlier, the model number matches, so....my first experience with an unlocked phone purchase on Amazon has gone well, IMHO. Thus far."
"The Samsung Galaxy S7 is perhaps the best mobile device right now. With so much technology, it has boosted the Galaxy S series. It is very easy to use and it makes you feel as if you don't have a mobile, instead you have so much more."
do not have samsung pay for international version. which is the main reason why I select samsung.
Device works fine and is fully unlocked and shipped in two days. All around good service
I'm kind of afraid that I wasted my money buying this considering all of the negative reviewsi just read. I surely hope that it works out when I receive it
"Love my phone, but I wish they came out with a bigger internal memory. Can't store the downloaded Amazon Videos on the external memory. So I can only keep a few movies then delete them after watching it. I don't want to steam videos or it will eat my data, and I'm not at a Wi-Fi hotspot all the time. That so far is the downside. Also, my phone did freeze once, but I was able to hard boot it by holding down the power button and the volume up and down button at the same time for a few seconds."
"I'm not one who generally uses my phone. I'm a pay-as-you-go type of person. I use my phone for calls and texts. I see no need to pay extra for internet with the number of places with free wifi. My last phone was the Samsung Gravity, so this was a large step for me. For my needs, this phone is extremely oversized... with that being said, the display size makes it great for other things. I try to use my phone minimally. I use apps for the weather because I own a convertible and love the beach. I also chat with some friends using LINE. I was holding out for the 64GB version, but didn't see any availability for it and needed the phone for work... so I can download and read email... and chat using Lync/Skype.PROS- 12 MP camera for nice crisp pics.- excellent display for viewing photos and movies- extremely fast and smooth opening and switching apps. I notice no lag whatsoever.- expandable storage- battery can last me two daysCONS- size- easy to accidentally press button on sides- internal memory options for the U.S.- color choices by cell phone carrierIf there is one regret, it's that I wish I had bought the dual sim version just in case I wanted two carriers so I can maintain my grandfathered price plan and still pay separately for wifi should I ever need it."
Excelent all
"Exynos processor. ISOCELL camera sensor. No Carrier bloatware. Suspiciously missing the Galaxy S7 Edge logo on the back shown in the photo. Aida64 shows the correct info, though.I've used the phone for over a week, now. I'm very happy with it. Still getting used to some aspects of the interface, but what it does, it does incredibly quickly. No lag in anything. Samsung has some nice features included. I love the health suite. I love the battery life.Cons: the duplicate apps. I want the ability to remove the browser, email app, etc. Things that I don't use. Things that Google also includes. Can't uninstall those either, surprisingly. Also, the whole Edge thing... There aren't enough ways to customize it or the edge notifications which display with the always on display. Also, the built-in so to transfer app data from your old phone didn't work with my HTC One."
I have been using this phone for three days now. I was impressed that the phone was delivered sooner than expected. The box was sealed and everything was intact. My only problem is that this phone came with a plug you use in Europe and where I live we use the plugs used in the US. Not a big problem since I can charge the phone with other chargers. I bought the international version since I read that the Exynos chip is better than Snapdragon. I previously used a Samsung S3 which recently died and it wasn't a difficult transition. I also have a P8 Lite which in my opinion takes better selfies. I'd still buy the S7 edge again though. The phone is very fast. Battery life is exceptional. I have only charged it once so far and it still has 52% of battery life left! I also love that the phone is very loud. The phone fits easily in my small hands and is pretty light. I also love being able to unlock the phone with my fingerprint. I also love that the speaker is very loud. For someone who's hard of hearing like me that is a plus!
"Less than ONE MONTH after I purchased this, it's gone wonky...randomly restarting even when I'm not using it, freezing then re-starting when I AM using it...I LOVE the S7 Edge, but I knew buying on Amazon was a BAD IDEA.If there's any way to exchange this item without having to go without a phone for a week, I want to exchange it...but I work from my phone and this is a real crap-storm right now."
"The device is a 100% win. The only aspect that I didn't really understand is that at the back of the phone it doesn't say ""Galaxy s7 edge"". Other than that it's a pretty awesome deal."
"I have received my Samsung Galaxy S7 G935F satisfactorily, NGP Store you are the Best! Thank you for the order. I will have present you for make more purchases in the future."
"The phone that was sold to me as unlocked is asking for a network unlock code.... this is BS, the phone is not actually unlocked. Wireless Everything is not telling the truth about this. If I don't receive any contact I can only conclude that I was taken to the cleaners and my money is down the rat hole."
"For reference, my previous phones were not flagship phones but rather they call under the budget/mid-range smartphone category. This may skew my review a bit since I'm going from mid range to flagship, but I think the Galaxy S7 Edge has so much going for it that it doesn't matter too much about my previous reviews.PREVIOUS PHONESNexus 5, OnePlus One, OnePlus Two, Nexus 5x, Honor 5xDESIGNThis phone is beautiful. Honestly, I love looking at this phone and I find myself wiping down the phone to maintain it's reflective silver reflection. In the day and age of large phones, the Galaxy S7 edge finds the perfect size.(To Be Continued. I'm writing this on my lunch break)SUPER AMOLED DISPLAYThe display on thisPERFORMANCECAMERABATTERY LIFE IS FOREVERWATERPROOFINGFINGERPRINT READERIf I had to fault this phone for anything, it would be the fingerprint reader. For some reason, my phone doesn't always recongnize my fingerprints. I've reset them a couple times and it still doesn't always read it correctly. My last three phones had fingerprint readers and they were all quicker or more accurate than the S7 Edge. I suspect that it's because the home button is very short (height-wise) and that the home button is raised.FEATURES FEATURES FEATURES"

"I received the package open, the wall charger inside the package it was for U.K, I expected to receive the US connector. the phone recently it was completely dead I need to did a procedure to re start it. For these reasons I was no satisfied with my purchase."
The phone is working well but the chargers adapter can't be used in the US. I would like if the company can send me a charger to use to charge my phone.. Apart from that all is good about the phone. Does it have a warranty tho ? If it does how long?
I have 3 mons and no work more.
I am not able switch on my mobile since today morning. The last used yesterday night and when I woke up in morning I found my mobile was totally dead even not charging also.Kindly help me to find the solution.
"Works excellent on Cricket. No issues, this is a truly unlocked phone. Had purchased a so called unlocked phone from a retail store that calls it self the Best to Buy at. They even had displayed signs saying ""Free to choose"". Except after paying more then $800 I found out freedom came after paying another $300 over a 6 month period, to Ole Ma-Bell. Then they would provide me an unlock code for my ""unlocked"" phone.If you're looking for a unlocked that's really, buy it here."
I got this item yesterday.. But it looks great!!
It doesn't work .. and I send it back to Amazon and I am waiting to give my money back .
"The charger adapter was not in the box, I can not use the phone."
"I loved the phone. Firstly it works, there is no problem with the phone. It is fast and sharp. Screen is big and colorful. I love the curve part. With normal use (some social media, little talk, some music stream with bluetooth earphone it's battery goes for 2 days. If I play Pokemon, it goes 1.5 days"
thank you for my phone
Only head the phone a few days and already it has glitches. The volume will randomly turn itself back on from vibrate without anyone even touching the device and also the power button sometimes woulnt work
Great phone but charger was not original everything else it great
Phone that I have received was broken. Whenever I take a picture under any kind of artificial light I get bright yellow/orange spot at the center which also shows up in pictures.
Optimo!
At first I gave this 5 stars. Now I'm giving it one because it has a vertical pink line going up and down the phone. I spent a crap load of money on this phone for it to be doing this. I will give it 5 stars again once the problem is fixed or phone is replaced
A+
"I have been a Samsung Galaxy owner before, but decided to make a change to a phone that started good then got worst.I used to own the s3 and I'm glad I made a comeback to Samsung once again.The international version seems to be faster and have a longer battery life than the last phone I used to own. With one charge it'll last me all day, while on the other phone I had to recharged it when I got home from work.The graphics are amazing and I haven't had any glitches or problems with the phone so far.I did buy a screen protector and phone case since I seem to break phones quite easy.The screen itself seems to be scratch resistant.As for water resistant I can't say anything since I haven't used my phone in the water, I don't feel confident enough to drop my phone in the water or have it in the shower.This is so far the best phone I've owned, it does not heat up as bad as my other phone and it has an elegant view."
 I Thought that the galaxy S7 edge is the best product but after just one week of use (it was not a massive use because it was my secondary phone) a black lines appeared on the screen when I change the brightness I reset the phone but I noticed it's a hardware issue not a software problem and I found myself unable to do anything because I am leaving the country
Amazing!!!
Beautiful phone
Good phone.
"Great phone and camera. Seems to slow as you load on more apps, but still faster than my S5"
"I was very surprise when I turn on the phone it seems that it was not new because it was already configured, I dont see the first time I turn on de Willkommen screen. It was configures in Dubai. The phone work, Also de charger is very sttrange , very big and with rare conectors.......The phone is very good but Im conserned that you send me something used whe I paid the full price."
"Great phone, though can be very buggy at times."
The phone is solid but I can't stand the edges. I ended up going back to the Note 5
"It seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves, who break the phone's box seal, open the box, and unlock the phones themselves (note that Samsung says ""do not accept if seal is broken""). Hence, technically, most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new. I bought a lot of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phones from Amazon, and most (not all) had the seal broken.On the phone itself, interestingly, the S7 Edge feels lighter than the S7 (even though it is 3% heavier ... maybe because the weight is distributed differently). The bigger screen is good for people with vision issues, but the resolution is the same as with the S7. The edges are highly annoying, making one touch them by mistake constantly. Furthermore, the edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case. I do not like this phone. I love the regular S7."
I received a wrong version...
The best Phone
"I'm so upset the phone keeps freezing and it just jumps from one app to the next without me selecting anything. Sometimes it don't allow me to restart it or turn it off. It also restart by itself sometimes, I'm very disappointed having me thinking if it's a refurbished phone."
Great product won't regret buying.
good excelent.
Amazing one
"Sooo ummm I got it the next day after ordering it, which is crazy. I done my personal testing and I'm really Impressed makes my note 1 feel like a brick.... edited part: I dropped it in a huge puddle today sat for a good 7 mins under water, pulled it out and still works great"
Excellent
good
"Came in perfectly fine, works fine. Is sexy. Yes."
Love the phone I was a little scare at first because some of the paper instructions were in arabic but I put the phone to work without trouble manage to change the settings to english and spanish .It is a great phone charge really fast the adapter came for middle east kind of current but they were kind and send a travel adapter for it works great so far I am really happy thank you.
The phone was working pretty awesome then it just crashed and wouldn't turn on. Did all the troubleshooting I could and it still wouldn't turn on. So I had to return item.
"Excellent product, it cover al my expectations and more. The seller has a great attention."
"Excellent Phone, astonishing camera and amazing performance."
Perfect
Ok
Great purchase.
"S7 Edge from United Arab Emirates (its what the phone detials say in the settings). Was brand new and unopened. Works perfectly. Setting it up was as easy as popping a nano sim card in. Was worried something might be faulty but the processor is snappy, screen is perfect as is the camera. No faults what so ever. Ordered Sept. 28 and arrived Oct 1st. I would highly recommend as there is no bloatware and it has a faster processor than US version. Have not tested the waterproof feature to give feedback on that.Seller: Wireless Everything"
"Best phone on the market, it is so amazing!!!! I love every little detail about this phone, IP68 water proof, absolutely amazing screen perfect size phone feels very amazing in hand alot better than iPhone, iPhone is slippery in hand compared to the beast of a phone, I love it!"
"Excellent phone, I have no complaints with it so far. However, this is the first Samsung phone that I have ever managed to crack the screen on. I have always used my phones without a case, and never had a screen crack until this one."
"Best phone I've ever had. I've owned iPhone, Sony, Nokia, but, this, is the best in any sense."
"Product came sealed unopened and is indeed a geniune s7 edge, very happy with the phone and shipping was fast as well."
Very nice cell phone. Although it is international model but still it is very good. Came with europe's charger but is very good phone. It had nice packaging on the product.
Love this phone. Very nice and beautiful. Fully unlocked to all networks and 32gb is plenty of space. Curve screen looks great but functionality not overly used.
Pay a great price for an excellent product. A++++
Is a great smartphone... my gift for Christmas... the cellphone was delivered without problem. 100% recomended
"The screen cracked completly with a fall on the ground when I was going up in a car. So it was not a big distance or fall. I used to have the S6 edge, and definitly had more falls and from much higher distances, and this never happened before. This was the first fall, and it breaked a lot. And after the minutes where passing, it where cracking more and more. I'm not living in the USA, so I had to fix the screen in my country, and the cost of a new screen was around 300 dollars. More than half of what the phone cost me. I can understand that if the phone fell from my pocket it's my fault, but what I don't understand is how fragile it is. Obviously, besides that, it's a great phone, but the fall was very light and the damage very strong."
"Nice looking phone, bought on april/2016, almost 7 months later my screen shows a dead pixel, it's suppossed that i have a one year international warranty, i contacted samsumg.com and the told me ""that the warranty does not apply if you buy on an online store"".For an expensive unit, i'm pretty dissapointed.Still wainting for seller to respond my email."
"This phone is good, somewhat slippery but good, but I have problem with Samsung. I ordered it from US to US and yet my phone can be repaired only in AFRICA? As it is unlocked International phone IMEI number does not exist in Samsung US database, where it is listed? Answer can be found only in the box, which can be read only after receiving the order: Africa!?!I believed that phone bought in US should be serviced in US. Period.It is verified original, made in Vietnam, and was working good until small fall resulted in flickering screen. Now I want to service it but Samsung holds this phone is not in database and suggest to send it to Nigeria, or Ghana...That is just wrong from a serious company. Therefore one star."
Im a die hard galaxy fan but im not made at the phone its self but its hardware 4 months after i got this phone i got this screen flickering glitch. And a week later the screen dosnt work i love the phone but my parents arent getting me a galacy anytime soon
Using it everyday and still rocking.
Do not buy this piece of garbage. If you break it it cost $400 to repai it. It broke the first time I dropped it.I called Samsung and they said our technicians can't currently repair Galaxy S7 Edge phones.Back to iPhone
bad
"Good product, but a little defect. The home button make big noise when pressing it."
Thanks very good
Great product.... great seller
It said the phone was unlocked and I can't even use it with Verizon very upset
beautiful good
Perfecto
Good
beautiful and fast
"This phone is the best and has no problem, it works perfectly in Ecuador."
I am a bit concerned about the battery I was expecting it to last longer than it does
Very good
Everything was ok the phone is great :)
The best smartphone.I feel like a baby with new toy.
"Perfect size, amazing front camera and super fast phone..."
I received my phone on time and it's working perfect
Why does this phone have different features than my friends like this one say about device and my friends says about phone and MA you more stuff too but why
Amazing and beautiful!
"Best phone available today. Stunning 4K display, amazing camera and water proof....whaaaaatttttttt. Awesome."
Best phone ever! Happy and satisfied!
really nice phone
nice phone
Was as expected
Fantastic
"Love it!!! its so beautiful, so fast!!! I love it love it love it!!!"
Works great
"Arrived in great shape, very fast setup, works great! I have used over 3 weeks and this is a fantastic device."
It à good phone
"Great phone, everything looks nice, thank you. I'll be testing it and let everybody know how it goes. But so far it's awesome.It's been a while now and in gotta say this phone is fantastic. I've had a galaxy phone since the G-S2 till this one and believe me, this one is by far the phone I've ever had. Yes it can improve for example, the back cover would be great in aluminum (kinda like iphone) it'll prevent from cracking in minor accidents. The speakers can always be louder I guess. Oh yeah I forgot, the battery... Omg is the best thing ever, thank you Samsung you did great."
I've had nothing but issues with this phone since I got it. I have apps randomly opening and closing on it's own. I've read online that it is due to the screen being too sensitive. I've been waiting for a update from Samsung on this matter but it seems like my phone was from Egypt and I have not received an update yet. Pretty much the phone has been unusable for me because I can't even type or navigate the phone without it closing me out of applications or opening up ones randomly. I am very disappointed in this. What are my options?
"It is a great phone overall. It is running exynos processor, which was made by samsung. The packaging also include the American plug adapter since the device was made for European country. It is unclocked and works well of tmobile. It should work with other services as well."
OK
so good <3
All good
Excelente!!!
After 2 months the display look weird! Colors everywhere.
Good price
I love it... :-)
"The phone is great, works well with at&t services"
Liked it awesome.....
Excellente
"Waaaaay better than my iPhone. Can't say enough good things about it so I'll leave it at this: if you don't have one, you're missing out."
Excelente
feels too bulky I'm glad I bought a new iPhone 7 much slimmer and miles ahead in voice quality
Love my phone Samsung is a boss
The charger comes with the UK Plug. Would have been nice to know it before buying it.
I cannot make video call
Excellent!!!!!!
Todo ok..!!
Excellent cellphone. Battery is amazing.
"I received this phone yesterday and instantly fell in love with it. I have owned several Galaxy phones (s3, s4, s4 active, and s5). So far I love it! It came sealed in the original box. I cannot use the charger adapter that came with it, but I expected that as it's an international version.I picked the gold color, it looks and feels elegant and sleek. I love the interface, the phone itself is super fast. The phone has a big, beautifully bright screen. I am still getting used to its size. The fingerprint scanner is noticeably better than that of the gs5. Both cameras take amazing pictures.I am one of those people that are constantly on their phones during most of the day. It has an excellent battery life and charges very fast.I did read a couple reviews where people complained about the phone slipping out of their hands. I have used an Otterbox Symmetry Series case since I took it out of the box and have not had that problem at all.My only complaint about this phone is that it does not have an IR blaster, but I can live with that.I will update my review in the future if anything changes.UPDATE:I have been using this phone for about a month now and it is still just as amazing as when I took it out of the box. It still has amazing battery life. I have a Pocket Juice power bank that I was using around noon every day with my Gs5 but I have not used it at all with this phone. It usually still has 15% after about 12 hours of use.I have not had any lagging or random restarts like I did with my Gs5. The phone is still amazingly fast and responsive.I have slightly tested the waterproofing of this phone. The fingerprint scanner does not work well when wet, but the touch screen is still responsive.I have a Otterbox Symmetry Series case that I use with this phone and I have noticed that it causes the Zagg Dry screen protector to bubble up around the edges (I would like to state that I did NOT allow the protector 24 hours to ""cure"" after applying before putting the case back on, so that could be the reason.) I have heard that with the edges it is hard to find a case/screen protector combination that doesn't cause bubbling at the edges.Overall I would definitely recommend this phone."
Good.. thanks...
"This is a great phone! screen, design, camera, you won't have complains. Except that there are options almost as good as that for a lot less money."
except samsung pay everything is good
"Buyers Be AwareThis shipper has send me 'FAKE"" Samsung cell phone.Everything looks almost similar to the original Samsung but many features do not work especially the Camera makes terrible low pixel pictures, no screen stability, always lagging behind and many more.... buyers be aware.Although I send it back immediately, I am still working to get my money back."
just what I was looking for
Best phone I've ever bought!
It was to expensive. And it does not get fully charged in 4 hours and it does not stay charged more than 12 hours. I like my LG flex better.
Excellent product!!!!
It was good
I LIKE PHONE PROBABLY MORE THAN ANY I HAD SO FAR ESPECIALLY CAMERA AND IT FUNCTIONS GOOD SO FAR'
Good
I didn't like the fact that the phone came with a charger that can't be used because it doesn't have the prongs for this country and all instructions were in another language
"I paid for a new phone, but the phone I received was already set up and displays 7 voicemails from the 19th of April thru the 13th of May, and the plastic film was put back on upside down. WTH! Sadly not only are they thieves, but they are incompetent thieves!"
"Liked a lot the device. Only thing that came with very low, cheap quality was the AC adaptert. Look like the one you buy in grocery shop at half dollar. All accesories came within sealed box (headphones, sim remover, usb adapter, charger, device, etc)"
"Excellent and awesome phone! I think I won't upgrade this phone 2 years 'cuz it has everything! micro SD, OUTSTANDING battery! water and dust resistance and AMAZING and colorful screen! and flawless performance! It's just magnificent!"
Not sure why the reception is so weak Bad antenna ?
"Hands down the best cell phone I have ever owned. I have a iPhone 6 for work which I love, but this S7 beats it by a mile. Battery life is outstanding unlike so many Android phones, and the display and camera are top notch. I like this international version with the non-US processor and it seems to be getting better battery life than the Snapdragon processor for the domestic market. Either version though is still the best on the market."
The Q&A said this comes with a US power adapter. Mine did not. I got the German pin-type power connector without any adapters for the US.
Excelente
This cell phone is so pretty，I love the edge！But sometimes it will overheat.
the best
Shipped in a reasonable time frame and worked with my carrier (t-mobile). First time I have ever bought a phone outside my carrier so I did a lot of research and I am well pleased with the result. The processor (this one has the international processor--much faster than the US processor) and battery life is wonderful!!! Right now it's 5:04pm and it's been off the charger & heavy use since 7am and I have 60% battery!
i only had my phone for about 3 weeks and the screen start jumping rapidly
The phone is good except the phone's charger is not the US version.
very good quality Amazon good job
"Telephone edge Dandy Yes, it's a phone in the top extravaganza I've loved phone I am very happy very, very strong"
"Love the phone I bought (black onyx). Works very well. Great camera, great screen sensitvity and charges quickly. The only downside is that I have to use a converter with the fast charging cord. I find it cumbersome although it works well. I guess it was made for a British market."
"It's everything i hoped for in a cellphone. It is fast, beautiful,though the camara doesn't really take great pictures in low light or dark spaces. Eveything else is just perfect!"
You can't go wrong this phone is awesome....
the machine.very good
"I usually read reviews bedore ordering anything, and therefore I was very anxious while ordering the phone. Various users various experiences.But for me, i got a good deal on device. I got it whithin a week. And its a Latin American version with US wall charger.And so far device is performing as it should be.10/10"
Excellent Very thank you
Phone stop working in 3 months
"Hello, shipping has come to the House of my friend in Miami. I traveled the day November 15, that day I will know if you are all well. thank you."
"The seal was broken. The phone was completely fine, and it is the original phone. Other than that, all as is to be expected - great product!"
"Everything as expected, better than punctual. I missed that the charger was not compatible with 110w plug but it came with a converter."
It's an excellent phone very fest and he has an excellent reception. Also the battery is very very good doesn't run out but if you have small end it's hard with the hedge
"If I had the option of voting ""Zero"" stars I would. I bought my Galaxy S7 Edge and paid full price for it less than 7 months ago. Now the phone is presenting a hardware problem which was already acknowledged by Samsung that it is a factory problem, what means, they know it is their problem and that they are supposed to get it fixed or exchanged. However, because it is an ""Unlocked International Version"", no Samsung authorized service would even touch the phone. Not even if I am paying for the service. So, now I have a USD 800 paper weight worth nothing at all. I hope Samsung is reading this. I have been a Samsung Loyal customer since Galaxy S II and now I am dropping this ""Loyalty"" for a Windows Phone (yeah, Windows Phone. After wasting my money with a ""Samsung Flagship"", a windows Phone is all I could afford to buy). Thanks Samsung, you have made an (ex) customer really (un)happy !!!!!!"
"My boyfriend got this phone over the summer, and he actually likes it much better than his former iPhone. It comes with earbuds, a charging cable, and a very useful charging adaptor to accommodate different charging ports. I personally think it's too big, but I have small hands haha. Overall, a very reliable phone that works really well."
"phone is good, but the seller is a swindler"
Everything is good
Very good quality
Great
"Till now is very good, and I have it for 2 weeks. But I hope to be the same because I have a friend who had the same phone and her display was buried after one month and I heard that other people had the same problem"
cool
"I would like to report the following: 3 days ago after charged my cell phone it had a burst and broke the glass of Case Battery Door Cover the back, after the fact the battery does not hold more charge. Now I would like to know what will happen ?!!!"
Don't buy these phones because you will have to stand the loss like I did. I purchase this phone in July and when I returned home and start using the phone overheated and burnt the screen. I payee 400 USD to get it fixed and it still haven't fix properly and all Amazon did was sent me $150 for my troubles! I had a loss. I'm out of the country and not returning until May. My business with Amazon with Electronics are DONE! Even after fix there are two shades of light in the phone and the technician said it's a software problem. He said I should contact Samsung. I just gave up on everything.
Very nice.
"Shipment arrived on time. So far, the best phone I've owned. Takes some effort to locate and update the device firmware."
"The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a awesome phone, worth the price! Grateful to have compared to other smartphones."
"Be careful , It comes with UK Plug ."
"Excellent screen, fast, good battery life, has met my expectations."
"Good seller, product as per description."
"First of all this phone did not have DUAL SIM, but that is the seller's fault for the bad description. However the screen quickly shattered even with a protector on and without even dropping it. Something just bumped my leg and it was done. Screen replacement is very high as well. not having airdrop and imessage really takes away ease of use."
"Perfect service, Quick delivery, Great product.Thanks!"
Cracked after 4 months. Great phone but very easy to break
"Phone was already opened when I received it. Factory seal was broken and a cheap white sticker stuck over it to make it look like it was sealed, but the original broken seal was still underneath. The protective cover had also been removed because it wasn't on straight and there were bubbles and lint under it. Factory unlocked means unlocked from the factory, there should have been no reason for anyone to have opened it to unlock it as it said it came that way from the factory. Good part was returning it to Amazon was very easy, though I had to wait several days to get the $ back on my credit card to be able to buy another phone."
IT stopped working after 1 day. Major disappointing
This phone stopped working after 3 months. It reboots the on its own and freezes constantly.
"*** FRAUD *** I ORDERED THIS FROM ""BEST PRICE MOBILE"" AND RECEIVED A DUMMY PHONE NO USB CABLE *** JUST A PLASTIC DUMMY PHONE GAMESTOP CHARGER AND ARAB MANUALS *** BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!!! *** FILED FRAUD COMPLAINT WITH AMAZON"
"Great camera, decent battery life, waterproof!"
I got the phone and it was on and were fingerprinted is this normal? or not?
Blazing fast and beautiful phone. Excellent camera
i can not use samsung pay and video calling facility in it.
Nice
It is working perfectly. I love it
very great phone i was abit worried when i ordered this but after recieving it using it i love it allot just some buyers know that with some carriers when u goto activate ur signal may just say 4g or lte or 4glte depends on where u r and ur carrier as for mine i have at&t usa and my signal says 4g i was hoping it would say 4glte maybe over time it will i dunno
good
Best cell phone ever. *****
"It's an awesome phone. The edge takes a little getting used to, but that's a small issue. Great camera, awesome sound in music and talking. Love the anti-glare. Seriously no glare from any angle. Even the headphones were great. Clear, crisp sounds. I bought the unlocked version and it works perfectly. Just had to insert the sim card and that was it. (And that's in the Caribbean) so for those customers wandering, it's definitely an Unlocked International Version. Highly recommended."
Switched from an iPhone 5 and so glad I did. This is an amazing phone!
Good products
Excellent
Love it
The charger which was sent with the phone does not apply to the USA setting.it is really giving me a hard time to charge and I also expected the phone to come with a memory card but it does not have one.
Everything as should be... would buy from them again
nice phone very good
"Amazing phone. Bought it to use it in Argentina, 4G works perfectly. Packaging was inmaculate."
"Love Love Love this phone. The screen is crisper than anything I have seen, it's fast and beautiful. Life is good"
All excellent
"Bought this for my teen, he loves it!"
"I ordered this phone which was branded as an original but it was completely fake. Not only was the Samsung brand not on the back of the phone, but also the features of the phone event the writing was different from the original phone."
Everything great. Bought from wirelessplace.
Yes. sick lookin phone. I saw couple of feedback that says fake phone or something fishy. In my case it was all good. And about the phone it's great! Nothing much added to s7 accept hardware improvement. Touch unlock is much much better then s6 generation. Great bettary life something aspect from Samsung. Not dissopointed at all.
"Excellent phone. Everything arrived well to Venezuela, except the travel charger that does not work"
"I bought this right after my iPhone decided to stop working which was this past Saturday and I'm not disappointed. It's definitely bigger than the iPhone 6 so sometimes it feels like I can't hold it right..The battery life is amazing, great camera - Def different than a iPhone camera, great screen size and colorI have Cricket Wireless as my network and it's working great,BTW that company has the same signal as AT&T, but sometimes I have to resend texts several times, it's gotten annoying. Idk if that's a phone thing or provider issue?My last android was the galaxy S3 now to the S7 Edge, incredible improvement"
Excelent
One of the best phones out there.
I like the camera.
"DO NOT BUY! They will NOT SUPPORT YOU! DO NOT BUY! Purchased on June 10th 2016. 3 months later, the PHONE BRICKS. No damage, no spill, never even touched water, in a case its whole life. Just stops working, going on, nothing. Got extremely hot for about 2 hours for no reason after it went dead, but then nothing after that. Called Samsung (had registered the device and everything), first they collected info on the phone and said they will call back in 24 hours. Waited a week, no call. Called back and they straight up told me they will not help because Samsung America does not help Samsung Anywhere-else. They connected Amazon, and Amazon just dropped the phone on me in mid sentence with no call back! (And no number I can call them back). Return policy ends July 31st ONE MONTH+ after the order!!Basically if you buy this phone from here you will not be supported if anything goes wrong.... and my phone BRICKED with neither Samsung, Amazon or TheCoos stepping up to the plate to support or repair. I wonder why Apple has a loyal fanbase? *Dripping with Sarcasm*DO NOT BUY! They will NOT SUPPORT YOU! DO NOT BUY!"
Exactly as promised. Was worried I wouldn't be able to activate it with an American carrier (since the included documentation indicated that might be a problem as opposed to requiring a European carrier to activate it first) but it worked fine.
Why the phone doesnt say galaxy s7 edge on the back ?
I love it.... it works get on metro pcs. I live in NYC. No complaints
"I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935F in Black from this product page a week ago.A lot of people have asked questions about this particular international version so I'll answer some of those first. For starters, the one I got was the english edition for the Saudi Arabia market (see attached photos, the guides came in english and arabic). From what I can tell, the phone is the same as any other international edition but with different preinstalled apps. Mine came with a SA region specific app ""Shaid"" (seems to be a YouTube-esque app in arabic) that I uninstalled and WhatsApp. Other than that the only remaining bloatware was stock Samsung apps (no carrier apps, thank god), the only other thing I noticed that may be region specific is the S Planner app has a ""Hijri dates adjustment"" setting. Lastly this version ships with a non-us wall charger (aside from the regular stock accessories) shown in my review images. Mine also came with an adapter for use within the U.S., I have tried it and can confirm that it works with fast charging.This phone also uses a different chipset (manufactured by Samsung, called Exynos 8890) than the U.S. version. Reviews I read noted that the phone was actually optimized for this chipset w/ better performance and battery life than the U.S. Qualcomm counterpart (Google it). In the U.S. version the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip is used to support Verizon and Sprint customers whereas this version only supports GSM carriers.To preface the review of the actual use of the phone, I have owned the following devices and used them each as a daily driver for at least a months time: Samsung Galaxy S4 GPE, Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, HTC One M8 GPE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P. The Galaxy S7 Edge has been the most delightful experience of the bunch. I won't go into great detail here but the camera is phenomenal and launches faster than any other phone I've owned w/ a double tap of the home button. The camera's auto focus is super fast and I feel like I'm able to get a capture a lot of moments that my previous phones were too slow to shoot. It's also nice to be able to change the quick launch apps on the lock screen, I have the dialer and snapchat as mine.Continuing a theme of high performance this phone is incredibly fast despite powering a QHD resolution screen. Apps are surprisingly quick to load and multitasking is a breeze (I even found some use in the Samsung's split screen feature). The fingerprint scanner is on par with apple devices (and nexus 6p/5x) although because of it's non-circular shape I find that I place my finger the wrong way more often. The battery is the best of any device I've used as a daily driver, I've been able to get through days of heavy usage like today (unplugged from charger at 5:45am, now at 25% at 9:03pm).The screen is BEAUTIFUL. Not only is it easy to read even in direct sunlight (something I have seen other devices struggle with) but the colors are vibrant and the screen is huge without making the phone too big or bulky. Perfect for watching YouTube videos and browsing instagram.Lastly a few notes if you buy this phone:- If you're not a fan of the stock Samsung launcher you can get the Google Now launcher from the Play Store, it's the same one used on Nexus devices and feels smoother than Samsung's launcher.- This time around Samsung decided to give you bigger icons which drove me nuts, search for ""Get more on your Galaxy S7, S6 or Note 5 screen with hidden DPI scaling settings"" from Android authority to get a 5th column on the home screen and smaller UI elements.- ""Edge functionality"" is just okay. The feature feels a bit less than polished because of the weak offerings in the Samsung app store - I have it turned off.Edit 4/8/2016: sorry about the quality of the photos of the actual phone - they were shot with the wide angle lens of my GoPro whereas the other images were shot with the S7 Edge.Edit 4/10/2016: added some higher quality images from my new camera.Update 5/9/2016: I've been using the phone as a daily driver for over a month now. I'm still impressed by the overall gfx smoothness, how fast apps load, and camera performance.Update 7/25/2016: still in love with this phone. I'm honestly not sure what would compel me to purchase a new phone at this point.. I also rooted the phone and changed the emojis to the iOS 9 set with the Emoji Switcher app from the play store. No more guessing when messaging my iOS friends =)A lot of commenters have asked which seller I purchased mine from: Wireless Everything."
Great phone. Got it today and it's absolutely beautiful. Can't wait to give it to my boyfriend as a birthday present he will love it. So far IL very please and I'm sure I won't regret the purchase!
You must buy this phone!!!! Much better than iPhone!!!!
Very good item and fast shipping
"Although my shipping experience was a bit troublesome, the product itself its amazing! I knew it was international version but was not expecting a UK plug, best part is I get almost not bloatware"
"awesome phone, excellent camera, i bought 3 of these phones"
This is literally my first review because I never had a product that deserved my time...until I got this phone! It's absolutely the most amazing phone I have ever seen!Couldn't be happier!
its arrived and its single sim card not dual that is problem why that's happen ?
Perfect
"Hi WP, Thank you...I love my awesome phone."
"Good, no problems. Its been 4 months."
"I didn't receive the product, I got an empty package."
"My wife loves the phone. No problems with this one and I hope none come about. Other than getting a lemon on the first phone she received, this one seems to be perfect. Samsung is my favorite brand. Love all thier stuff.Amazon is great at helping customers take care of any problems they have with item by ensuring return shipping is easy and refunds are fast."
Thanks for nice and good product
"The cellphone was broken, bad seller"
Amazing
The phone is not working and when i turn it on the screen turns to green color
Nice phone
"Mejor, IMPOSIBLE!"
Phone came nice and all but won't hold charge. I need to charge it twice or sometime 3 times a day. I am thinking about doing a reset and see where it will lead me. But now I am away from home and won't be back for 2 to 3 weeks in other to exchange it. Grrrr I hate this
I purchased this phone from world wide distributors early last month and I have had the phone for just little over a month and it is defective!!!! My screen keeps blanking out and there are lines which are running through the screen which proofs that the phone had some underlying screen issues prior to being purchased by me. As you can see from the picture you can swe the lines which for under the screen and each time I try to complete an action the screen is forever blanking out and having lines. I am requesting an immediate of my money as this has been a waste. Do not buy
"Love this phone, great battery life and it's silky smooth UI."
"I bought it six months ago. Now it has overheating problems and the screen is flickering. Without warranty service, buy this phone is a waste of money."
"Perfect!!, just as adviced"
it made for middle east so there is Muslim holidays in calendar and other apps installed
Excelent product.. love it.
Was completely understand impression it would work on US Verizon. It did not.
"I purchased this phone for the expressed purpose of developing VR projects for Gear VR and Google Cardboard. I never expected or intended to use the phone features of the device. So I never added a SIM card much less carried it around or away from my office. After a couple of weeks the OS seemed to have crapped out and got itself stuck on some green terminal looking boot screen. Despite all my attempts to force a restart, perform a system restore, drain/charge the battery or whatever Android lets you do by holding in button X while closing one eye and whistling a happy tune, the phone just won't get past that Bootloader exception screen.I'm not an Android guy and since the purpose of the phone was to test apps, the device was required to be as close to stock as possible to adequately replicate the experience someone might have on their own device. By that I mean I didn't ""root"" the phone or mess with the OS beyond letting Android run all those auto updates it seems to do on a daily basis.I contacted Samsung US support and they said my phone didn't exist as far as they were concerned because it was obviously an international device. They told me to determine the country of origin and arrange service there.How convenient.I looked for some type of local resource that can service phones but it appears all that can be done are screen or battery replacements. Anything heavier has to go to the manufacturer...in Spain...or Antartica...or the Moon.I contacted the Amazon Marketplace vendor (Mobiles International LLC) that I purchased the phone from and they we nice enough in their correspondence and said:""Unfortunately Samsung does not provide warranty service on international unlocked phones. If you sent it to us in Miami, we can get a quote from a Samsung authorized service center to get the phone repaired. It looks like a software issue and should be fixable.""I FedEx'd them the phone and waited and waited. After two weeks or so I sent them an email wondering if there was any update.""At this time we have not received a quote unfortunately, the Samsung repair center here cannot repair your device because it is not Latin. We have one other option that we are trying. We will contact you as soon as we get a response.""And waited and waited...till about a month and half had passed and got this:""We received the unit back from Samsung this week. They returned the unit saying the warranty was void. We have shipped back to your address yesterday.""Huh? Is Samsung saying that I dropped it in a toilet? Or that I used my considerable phone hacking skills to circumvent their awesome software and install my own custom OS? No idea.So the lesson being, read the fine print. International unlocked phones may or may NOT come with a warranty. And even if you work yourself past that little detail and decide to roll the dice...if something goes wrong with your device there appears to be no recourse to have it repaired.Even if you expect to pay for said repair because the assumption being that a repair would cost less than the cost of a new phone there doesn't seem to be any reasonable way to facilitate getting it fixed. Waiting weeks and weeks to get some vague note about the warranty being void is hardly a workable solution."
announcer says that phone waterproof . He entered the water to photograph and phone filled with water and stopped working.
Love the phone but the front glass cracked within the first month with no foreseeable way of having ii repaired for much less than the cost of a new phone.
Best phone I ever had. Period.
Love it
I love it. It's beautiful
I didn't even download one app and the phone started heating up to the point that I couldn't touch the sides of the phone. I reset it twice and the phone was leggy as if it was an s2. I'm getting another one and after that one doesn't work which it obviously won't seeing that this crappie one almost melted I'm reporting them as frauds.
Best phone ever u till the note 7
I love it
The cel phone came with a burned pixel that didnt fix... the rest was ok
"I bought this phone in August for my wife, the phone has been a hassle from the get go. Two weeks after purchase the volume button started moving erratically on its own. Then the phone started hanging and will not reset by just switching off the phone, we need to hold the power button and the decrease volume button at the same time. The frequency of hanging just kept increasing, even after the doing a factory reset the phone continued to deteriorate. I am highly disappointed! I would have returned the phone if the window had not elapsed. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"
"Excelente Product!! No objections, just get a antislip case cause is like silk"
Its a bad experiencie because I Lost almost $120
Good item.
FRAUD!!!... Phone is from Brazil and does not work.
ok
ok
good every thing
"great deal, great seller!"
it is an excellent cellphone
Has lots of cool and helpful features. Performance is very good. I highly recommend purchase if you are considering switching or upgrading
I received the wrong power plug. Did not get the US type.
This phone is absolutely stellar. Amazing screen even in direct sunlight. Battery life is tremendous. The ONLY drawback is this version isn't compatible with Samsung Pay at this time in the US.
"Awesome phone and amazing camera I mean this is the camera to beat. S7 edge due to the bigger battery almost has 2 day battery life, touch wiz has been heavily refined, but nova is still the way to go. Design is slick and still a head turner and feels great in the hand. Number 1 of the top 3 Android phones , and I highly recommend only con is no Samsung Pay for international."
I'm satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy s7 EdgeIt's very good product beautiful. I truly loved.
"Buying this unlocked international Galaxy S7 Edge had me worried at first, it was in Spanish when I turned it on. You need to have your sim card inserted before you can change the language! After getting it to English I am totally please with it. I had the Galaxy S5, and compared to that phone, this Galaxy S7 Edge is AMAZING! There are so my new and cool features. I took 4 days to receive the phone. I'm totally satisfied with this purchase."
Love it. Exynos processor is much faster than us versionAlso I travel a lot to Mexico so be able to switch SIM cards is awesome
Excellent vendor. Product is exact as described. All Perfect.Recommend to all.
Great service. No issues .
Excelente
Great
"Although this phone was advertised as being unlocked, it would not connect to the AT&T network when we took it to get it activated. The AT&T employee told us that it was not unlocked or it would connect immediately. He even restarted it to double check. The Amazon representative who started the returns process gave us the name and phone number of the company that actually sold it. When we called that number, a Verizon automated service answered the phone. So my conclusion is that the phone must be locked to Verizon. My 15 year old son worked all summer and saved his money to buy this brand new phone on his own and took great pride in that fact. He is so disappointed."
Love it...100% original samsung edge7
Excelente!!!!!
Had the phone for 4 months. Suddenly no data. Contact seller and was told no warranty as its a unlocked phone. Load of crap
The Samsung Galaxy s7 edge is a great phone. It was easy to transfer my info from my old phone to the new one. Love the low-light camera. I'm really happy with my new phone.
Excelent Product is the best
Argentina ok!!! 😉
tons of bells and whistles.... very obnoxious if you have nerve damaged hands (screen and features constantly activating without consent!!)... several totally useless things you cant turn off or get rid of without rooting the phone.... as this product arrives with no US warranty.. you aren't voiding anything... that at least is a bonus! Several features arbitrarily reactivate despite having turned off etc....Samsung could have done a much better job with this model.
"Very fragile, broke to the first fall. No warranty."
"Great looks, camera, speedy.Overall great device."
was not for me
Amazing phone
Absolutely love the phone. Best purhase I ever made!
"The screen, the edge, pictures are GORGEOUS! What's not to love!"
Like very much.
"I'm really liking this phone. To be fair this is my first flagship phone. I'm coming from a cheap Nokia Lumia 520 but figured for once I'd splurge and see what all the fuss is about on these top tier phones.The first thing I noticed is that the screen is absolutely beautiful. I couldn't get over how clear and lifelike everything looked. Also being able to actually see my phone's screen in the sun was a definite plus haha. OLED is just an awesome technology and I can't wait until TV manufacturers tweak the picture processing a bit. Just a great display.I haven't run benchmarks or anything but everything on the phone is very snappy. Going into the camera, opening/switching apps, playing games, watching movies, etc. all ran smoothly. I didn't notice any warmth or the phone running hot but that probably due to using a case. The call quality was fine and overall I'm really enjoying it.On the down side, I think the phone's a little awkward to hold or picking up from a flat surface. I got this case Galaxy S7 Edge Case, SUPCASE Full-body Rugged Holster Case WITHOUT Built-in Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (2016 Release), Unicorn Beetle PRO Series - Retail Package (Black/Black) and the rubber edges made a world of difference. It's no longer slippery and easy to pick up off of a flat surface. Nothing worse than paying for a phone like this only to drop it while trying to set it up!The only thing I'm hoping is that the battery lasts quite a long time. Not having easy access to it is kind of a bummer. As I just dropped nearly $750 on it and I don't upgrade phones every year I'm hoping it lasts awhile. As much as I really do like this phone I don't think I'll be spending this much on a phone again. The purchase was more to quell my curiosity about these high end phones so I can check that off my bucket list hahaI purchased the phone from Wireless Everything and it arrived brand new in a sealed box with all new components. I popped my SIM card in and I was off to the races. I never purchased an international phone so was a bit nervous but everything went extremely well. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative I would suggest the OnePlus3 or ZTE Axon 7. Very similar specs for 400 smackaroos."
Love it's very nice looking and the camera is outstanding.
"The phone keep freezing ,"
Love my new phone takes amazing pictures battery life is long lasting and works perfectly with straight talk 😊
"I will never again buy a phone through a cell service provider. Buying unlocked through Amazon or some other reputable source saves you about 20%, and here's the really great part: no bloatware! Be careful to ensure that the phone will work with your service provider, but if it will this is the way to go without a doubt."
Awesome phone!
Good
"I use StraightTalk with this phone. It took no more than an hour to transfer my phone number to this phone, and I had exactly 0 issues with it since. If you want a brand new unlocked phone, I would recommend no further than this. It did come with some sort of foreign software, and Facebook and Instagram seem to be installed and non-removable, but they were trivial to disable."
good
"Easily the best phone I've owned. Period. Great battery life compared with my last 3 phones (xperia Z2/Note 4/LG G4) Extremely fast, reliable, easily manages all my applications (55), great camera, waterproof.. And on and on... Great phone.. Really worth the price. Chose it over the S7 due screen size and battery life expectancy."
no 4G LTE .. Wireless PLACE..w
Those black lines showed up from no where. I don't know what is the problem . I would like to get an exchange please
I'like. Good product.
It's not working. I need new one Tuesday. Wednesday I'm going back to Turkey. If I can't get one till Tuesday it doesn't matter what I liked or disliked about this
"Phone is very sleek. it looks nice and it has a lot of things going for it.- Water Resistance- Amazing and Fast Camera- amazing screen- pretty fast charging- Good Battery- Fast Charging- Fingerprint Scannerand others.but for all of its pro's it has a few Big Faults. The big one for me was how hot the phone got. For just using google Maps, to even playing Pokemon go for a little bit in the park, the phone got so hot I could barely hold on to it. I couldn't even imagine using this with a case on it might melt. Then when the phone detects that it gets too hot then it makes that big beautiful display lowers it brightness to where I can not see in the daylight anymore. I am having a lot of issue with it in the Sun.I have heard of these issues with other Samsung phones. Maybe its just the ones with this certain processor, I am unsure if the SnapDragon ones have this issues but the reason I got the international is that it could go to any carrier more or less and I could get the added performance of the Exynos Processor. Turns out it was a bad idea and the phone got so unreasonably hot that I could barely hold on to it. The phone also got noticeably slower as it got hotter. Probably because the processor was limiting itself.Maybe this could be fixed with a software update but I think this is more of a hardware issue. Maybe I just got unlucky and got a defective phone as i don't see many other people mentioning these problems. I do not blame Samsung or have any bad feelings for them. I just got unlucky with my device and will be returning it to Amazon."
"5 stars to the phone, 0 stars to ATT. ATT was not able to get 4G connection going on this phone. Blamed hardware. IMEI checked good. Phone would show 4G AP but could not establish data connection with it. Was only working with 3G AP at 3G speed.The thing that did the trick was temporarily inserting SIM card from friend's phone that was connecting 4G. My phone made 4G connection right away. Means hardware is good. Put back my own SIM card. Voila, phone still connects at 4G!"
"nice product, easy to use, but both front and back crack very easily."
Everything perfect
Great product! Got the Italian version. Doesn't seem to be any different. Good battery life.
"Works perfect with the Brazilians (GSM) carriers. Nice and solid finishing. Noticeable improvement from version S6 (I have one). I wish it was for two SIMs, but's ok."
"EDIT: So after owning this for a few months, I'm dropping the rating solely because of the Edge touch screen. The fact is that I find it very annoying to use. The side of your hand touches it really easily, and it it makes typing or playing games on the phone very frustrating. The edge apps themselves are very few and far between and not that useful either. It's a pity since the phone itself is great, runs programs well, has great visuals and camera but actually using the thing is just frustrating. I'd suggest getting just the S7 to save yourself some money and comfort.The phone that arrived is the genuine article and works great--I'm thrilled with how well the battery and fast charging works even when playing Pokemon Go all the time. Also, I have T-Mobile and the phone works perfectly fine.However, even though the app is on your phone, the international model is not compatible with Samsung Pay. If you want that you need to get the American version of the phone. I wish I'd known this, but to me it was worth the savings in price and you can still use Android Pay. But I didn't realize this before buying it and I would have liked to have known."
"After a few hours of use,unexpectly turned off,then it begins lagging and acting weird,just talk to amazon for help, they didn't help me because it was bought through a freight forwarder.i really feel like a wasted my savings for nothing"
The cellphone is not unlocked like the wibsite describes. The cwllphone is locked by T-Mobile carrier
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Package was not damaged and I loved the box of the phone. Appearance mean everything and the seller passed with that.
"Great Phone, great price, recieved Phone on time as promised. Thank you."
"this is the best cell phone I have. The size is almost the same as Samsung S5, except the format edge give us a very pleasant touch and view! The camera is exceptional, have auto focus and it is impossible to have bad pictures. The only problem is that it is so sensitive that a single harder touch can become multiple pictures..This is definitely the BEST SAMSUNG S series phone, and if the money is not the problem, forget the S7 and go to the S7 Edge!!!"
Great product so far..
S7 edge is the best
So far no!!!!!! I ordered the Samsung galaxy s7 EDGE GOLD and received the regular s7 in silver like wtf
"Very good phone. It's an international version, with adapter."
Excellent
Excelent!!
Excelente gracias
very good
"Did not come with charger adapter as expected, otherwise its PERFECT"
Fast delivery. Product awesome.
The mother board came broken and I cant do anything
"It's a great phone, i recomend!"
Cost-effective.Product delivered exactly as advertised.
No stars if I could I got a GS7 no edge
"I'm really pleased with the product,Met my expectations and the information provided by the seller is correct as the photos.I really recommend the product because for me it was very useful.I hope my comments were helpful"
I dislike this product is not working good
"Great display, good battery life"
"Beautiful phone, features are awesome! Still discovering something new about this phone daily. The camera quality is the best I've seen yet.It's very difficult getting a screen protector that fits , bought 2 and they didn't fit the edges (although it stated that it was designed for S7 edge!!!) Still trying to get one that fits.Very expensive phone though 🙁!!! But I am really enjoying it..."
"Great phone , just as advertising, delivery on time , everything was A+"
The phone is Great.I did not understand though why Samsung chose not to support hebrew as an OS language in their international software.Had to pay money at Samsung Israel to install the hebrew supporting software.
Great product.
It's a good one
Excellent performance. A superb phone
This phone is way too fragile. It fell from less than a foot and was totaled. The edge design must make the glass thin and fragile. I’m seeing people complain about the phone breaking without even being dropped.My other phones were never in a case and took many falls from 3-4 feet and only incurred scuffs. I dread the day my replacement breaks because I know it’s going to happen; it’s way too fragile.
Ok
excellent phone
Nice phone i like it
"Beautiful cell phone, light weight, thin, good screen size, lots of functions. As soon I inserted the SIM card it gat connected to my provider. Its working fine"
"International phones can not be repaired in the US. Despite the cost of this phone, it is a piece of crap. Samsung customer support will not help. LCD problem in less than 3 months with minimal use, and NO damage. Not even a scratch on the phone, yet it is almost useless. There are smart phones selling for $10.00. This one cost me $850.00 and did not last long. BUYER BEWARE."
"Excellent! Great design, smart, camera is wonderful even in the night time with bad light. Sensitive screen, fast internet... no problem. Thank you.Delivery in time."
ok
thanks very good
Perfect!!
All that I expected
"I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 and am absolutely Amazed by this phone. It can go for over two days before charging. It has none of the typical bloatware. It's supposedly waterproof but I don't plan on testing that on purpose. It's painful to have to pay the full price up front but it's worth it to not be at the mercy of your cell phone provider. I will never buy a locked cell phone from a cell phone provider again. I'm glad they brought back the SD memory slot, but I wish it had a removable battery. Other than that, I think the Galaxy S7 is one of the best phones on the market at this time."
"Excellent phone, I just wish it had all the band's of the phones so you can switch to any carrier like the nexus phones, and Samsung pay wish it had but I know because it's international it couldn't, but we'll made. :)"
Have had the phone for a month and just love it.
"I bought this phone for my dad and he is in love with it. It has fast-charging and all the high end specs that you could ask for in a top tier device. I don't know much about it, besides the fact that there hasn't been any issues thus far. It's got some interesting features and is a pleasure to use, I can tell you that much!"
Love this phone. Super fast. Screen is nice and big. Loaded with a bunch of great features.I connected it with cricket. Only 55 a month get great signal (cricket uses att towers)So i get nice fast connection with a low monthly cellphone bill.
"Love this phone. I upgraded from a galaxy s5 and it was well worth it. Aside from its design, what I love the most about this phone is its battery life. I can easily go a whole day, with moderate use of course, without having to charge the phone. The screen size is also perfect for my taste, not too big or too small. Strongly recommend."
"I bought this phone one week ago... I have no idea why there're some black stripes on my screen. When I increase the light, it's smaller..."
"I by the phone , and the screen have black point in corner left side..is damage.."
When I purchased this phone I was under the impression that it was unlocked. Now I find that it only works with at&the This is a scam . This phone only works on the AT&T network. It will not work on Verizon. Do not be fooled. This phone is not unlocked.
"Awesome device, water resistant, pretty fast. It's going to work with a lot of carrier all over the world. Beautiful external case made of glass. Samsung did it pretty good this time, for sure. The product came with an adapter for if you want to use it in the US. Another important feature is that you can still use this in the US and have the 4G compatibility, the only thing that you are going to miss it is the processor as the other US version has a better processor using the snapdragon 820. However, the Samsung exynos is pretty powerful too, so you probably wont feel the difference."
I received my package with no phone just a charger and headphones. Complete rip off!
Best phone ever it was easy to activate in my mobile service.
"This phone is the best i've ever had so far! If you have the cash and looking for a new phone, do not hesitate on buying it!"
"Phone works well for two months. Then the display turned off. I tryed to get support from Samsung, and they said is an International version, it has not warranty in the US. Needs to be sent to Australia for warranty service. Very ugly experience"
All ok
Unrepairable in USA
ExcellentI bought it for a friend he got it today and is very very happy with his gift
Very nice product.
"so far is amazing, fast, awesome screen. I haven't try the unlocked since I need new Sim card, now it uses the nano simple card, but I'm expecting to work."
"I'm a bit disappointed with my shipment. Only got European socket charger but no american charger or adapter like people say they got on other reviews. Also seal of packaging was already broken! And also packaging was kind of workn. Still phone looks great, bummer I will have to get a proper charger before using it! To nake things worse now phone is almost 10 dollars cheaper than when I bought few days ago."
great value product!
Awesome phone. Would recommend it highly
This phone works perfectly thus far.. I'm loving it!!
This is the best phone I've ever had
Perfect
good
A great phone with a lot of apps that can apply for fun or work. High speed and great connection.
This phone came newest. And many people asked where i bought it?. I most say what i see. Thanks again.
"Arrived on time and in perfect condition works perfect and very fast loading file and surfing,one of the best phones I have brought and will recommend to everyone"

"Stunning display. Impressive 5.5 quad -HD screen shows crisp colors from various angles. Best screen on any smart phone.Beautiful curved design is an eye-candy.Camera is not 12 megapixels and superior to S6 and iPhone. Auto-focus is also has great speed leaving others in dust.Large 3600mAh battery is like having a phone + battery case without actually having the thick battery case. Hard to kill that battery in a day.Always on mode constantly displays notifications without the need to unlock the phone.Water resistant. IP68 rated which means the phone can be totally submerged in water up to 1mt deep and 30 minutes.Micro SD expandable memoryAgain, the battery is so good."
"I have just one word for this phone: AMAZING!! Much better than Iphone, in my opinion."
Excelente!!!!
Way better than buying carrier branded and bloated version. Awesome phone!
Amazing phone
package was sent with the warranty seal opened however the seller clarified the reason of that. Phone works fine.My previous phone was a Samsung 5 but this one is amazing.
It is very good
"Love the phone so far, haven't really used it yet. But the charger is not compatible with the outlets here. Really disappointed about that, because now I have to either purchase another or find an adapter. Is there anywhere in the description that stated this was the type of charger used?"
Best mobile ever
"This item was received on April 21. On May 14, I filed a request to return the item since there are problems. Runs hot. Locks up and does not reset. The supplier, Worldwide Distributors responded on May 16, stating that I needed to contact Samsung Tech Support directly, providing no contact information for Samsung. Mind you, this is within the 30 day return window, but they never mentioned this in their response. I have contacted both them and Samsung and ALL i get is a run around. I cannot use the phone and I am not asking for my money back, I need a working phone."
Great phone
"Great device with so much to offer. I recommend buying from the seller, ""Mobiles International LLC."" They sent a new and reliable device and honored a warranty for a defective product on Samsung's behalf. :)"
Worldwide Distributors great job.
best way of online shopping for people who work on cruise ships
Works great worth the buy
all perfect!
Great phone. Improved battery life. Awesome camera.
"Problems with my product samsung galaxy s7 edge:1. Samsung galaxy s7 edge Box was not sealed2. It was labelled International version at the bottom of the box and also labelled American sim only at the back of the box3. After starting the device, I noticed the bottom right corner of the screen had a little blacked out portion on the display itself. (maybe damaged item was sent)4. When I opened the unsealed box, content was not arranged as it should be ideally. (It was messed up)"
Amazing smartphone. It's highly recommended
Broken phone!!!!!
Because the wife likes it
Good
"I love my S7 edge, the only thing is sometimes gets too hot."
It's ok 52%
"Good phone, works great on AT&T. They can't block WiFi Hotspot with this phone. I have unlimited data grandfathered but was never able to use my phone as a Hotspot with an AT&T phone. Only drawback is it comes with a European wall plug."
I was completely satisfied!
My seller Wlaphones did all as promised. They sent the phone in 2 days and had no problem no change the delivery address since I moved and totally forgot to make the change. 5 stars to the seller and 5 stars to the phone. I've had it for around 2 weeks and had no problems to activate it in TMobile. Amazing phone and great seller
"Is not a Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE.(SM-G935F) .It's a regular Galaxy S7 (SM-G930F)..accidental mistake or intentional error , But it's not the product that I payed for..I'am realy furious ..Be Carefully .."
The seller was good. They send me a sealed box. The problem is the phone. I bought it to use in Argentina. When I opened the phone in Argentina there was a pink line on the screen. It's a full pixel dead line across the screen. Y search on internet and it is a common problem with the edge phones and the solution is a new module/screen. There is no guaranty for me here.
"This phone is absolutely amazing. I could go on about the class leading camera, the all-day battery life, the amazing screen, the unquestionably useful Always On Display. That's probably not the most impressive thing about this phone though. Think about an iPhone 6/6S/7 Plus. Now think of the most annoying problem with that phone. If you're like me then the most annoying problem is undoubtedly the ENORMOUS bezels on the side of the phone. For those of us who want a bigger screen (because it usually means more features/a better viewing experience) the iPhone is damn near impossible to hold in the hand because after the screen ends, there is a huge swath of space on the sides that add several critical millimeters to the width of the phone. Not with this phone. The curved display not only looks amazing, but serves to give the phone a very compact footprint for the 5.5"" screen you are getting.That being said, there are things I don't like. Samsung still needs to make their software more stable and less energy inefficient. The longevity is more a virtue of the large battery than the software. Additionally the software can sometimes have funny quirks. Nothing too bad, but just things that are a little weird or slow sometimes.I also recommend that you buy a case for this phone. More than anything else on the market it's a work of art and you'll want to preserve it. I personally recommend this: Spigen Thin Fit Galaxy S7 Edge Case with SF Coated Non Slip Matte Surface for Excellent Grip for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 2016 - Black. This case is thin and almost feels like it isn't there. It'll make your phone easier to grip and give you piece of mind while you're out all day with it."
Received the phone and it was cracked
"Don't buy anything from this seller/company. I bought a Samsung Galaxy s7 edge, not even 2 months after the cell phone stopped working, Plus they don't accept returns."
Pretty nice phone. it looks great. it is very fast and i love the camera.
Exelente
Best phone I've ever owned!
got the phone works great
Shipped very fast.Great phone.The only thing i'm not satisfied is my unit have that so called front facing camera out of focus. I wonder if I can ask for a replacement for this and how long is the return/replacement window for this item. It would be very nice if this can be addressed. Thank you.
Love it!
Wow I love this phone and it was shipped the the very next day I ordered it.
My best phone ever.
amazing
Like it
"First of all, this product came delayed in shipping. One week late to be exact.Second, the cable charger usb that comes with the product is missing a line, slowing down my charging. Another small issue is that the charger plug is big and doesn't fit in most power extension cords.There is also a small heating problem with the phone when using it to play games or for long periods of time.For my personal preferences, I dislike the phone because all the buttons are very sensitive; even the power and volume buttons are sensitive and easy to press on."
The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge got here on time and in great conditions it works great.
I'm sure you've seen tons of reviews about the phone so if you are going to get it this is a good place to do so.
"on time ,no problem ."
"Great phone, very happy"
Good
"The phone it is ok.. but the charger dont work it for me, i am from latino america and the charger have an entrance different.. now i am looking for a charger in my country.. i paid 700$ and i can not charge my smartphone......"
"Greatest phone ever.I have used it for 9 days already and it's awesome.My only complaint is the lack of good glass screen protectors.First off the camera,it's awesome,although it's pretty similar to the S6.I wish they stayed at 16mp as it was 16:9 but otherwise, its great.It even has a wider angle,when zooming it had a tiny bit better quality than the S6 and autofocus is extremely fast.Low light was obviously insaneThe battery, this was one of my main concern with my S6 and the S7E battery is very good.The first days which tend to be pretty bad for battery life, where surprisingly good.I even had to drain it's battery sometimes.But to be honest it perfomed a bit worse than I expected, i mean, it's waaay better than the S6,but as a student I thought it would last me a bit more.I read articles on people saying they used their phone heavily and ended the day at 11:30 with 20 percent battery life(that was using bluetooth,nfc,location and wifi/lte on as they said) and in my experience, I have finished days with 35% battery from 7am to 11pm but only using either wifi or mobile data,no bluetooth or nfc,no location services on.So I think mi phone's battery is stabilizing yet(if someone can tell me if im right say it please!).As a student, I don't use my phone for long periods from 7 to 4pm.Maybe 15 min intervals or 30 minutes using gallery for photos,what really surprised me is that battery drained pretty fast sometimes and sometimes it almost didn't drain,which is weird.That's why I think it may be normal for the fist weeks(again,correct me if i'm wrong)BTW, I don't use powersaving,which I did on the s6 alwaysPower wise, It's an extremely powerful phone which can manage literally anything,and there's no lag with power saving on or off.There's not much to say.The phone is a bit bigger than the s6 and s6 edge.I strongly recommend it"
Cause it has everything.
Sleek phone. Looks great! A good size not too large. Fits well in my hand. Great camera and sound quality. Battery lasts for a day.
Phone seems refurbished. Google programs skip and it seems like it has a lapse from time to time. Slower than I expected and because of this I am afraid to test to see if it's waterproof as its supposeductive to be.
Soon after purchase the screen became pixilated and flickers and eventually went black. Samsung claims they don't cover the international LATAM phones under their product warranty even though it was purchased in the USA for international travel purposes.
"Do not buy this phone it does not work and is NOT unlocked as advertised. This is false advertising and wasted my time and money. I now cannot call my family while deployed into war, wasted my time."
I received the phone in sealed box. It was in good working order. It still is. Everything is fine.
all good
i love this phone and am enjoying it!!!
perfect
"This phone is by far one of the best on the market. After reading the reviews left by some of the buyers, there seems to be some confusion on what seller to buy it from. My phone, which is real, and came factory sealed, was bought from ""The Coos"". However, to my understanding, there is no one out there making fake edge phones. The phone is just too complex to duplicate. What might be happening is the phones could possibly be getting damaged during the shipping process. The phone is glass, so if the shipper isn't packaging it correctly, it could absolutely take on damage. This is why I recommend, that if you are planning on buying this phone from amazon, make sure amazon is the one fulfilling the order. I have had no problems at all when I order from a third party that allows amazon to fulfill the order. Also, it doesn't hurt to review the customer reviews on the actual seller as well.As far as the phone itself goes, it works perfectly. All the specs pretty much define what to expect from the phone. It's got the best screen in the world and the best camera. The glass finish makes it beautiful, but it's fingerprint prone and and extremely slippery. Other than that, I have no complaints."
The phone is great all the features are amazing there is now a front light for along self-esteem just like how snap chat does it the Camera quality is awesome. The battery life is great and it charges quicklyBut within less than a week phone haven't dropped or anything I saw 4 grey translucent lines come upon the screen sometimes when you turn up the brightness it goes away but who wants to have the brightness so high?? I'm trying to find out how I can get this fixed
Very Happy with my item it was exactly as described and it arrived on time.
the best one in the store
Great Phone !
"All issues regarding the Galaxy S7 edge were well received except for the app Samsung Pay. It doesn't seem to be available, tried to download and was presented with a Not compatible with this device warning. But for the most part, it meet all qualifications as advised."
"WOULDN,T TRADE IT FOR NOTHING ."
"I bought this cell some days ago and I couldn't be happier. This Latam version is working fine in Argentina. It's good to check before you buy if you cell works with in your country and carrier at [...] , very helpful...Thanks."
"The gadget works perfectly in Brazil, with VIVO 4G, but the battery life is poor."
Like
It's an excellent phone...
Very good
It stoped to work after 2 months. I am very disappoint.
"The features are OK, but it's not a great value. Not a huge step up from the Galaxy 6. If you have a Galaxy 6 edge and are looking to upgrade, hold off on this one. It's not groundbreaking stuff. More of the same."
Perfect phone except for the fact I cannot connect to 4GLTE in Texas on AT&T. I may try out TMobile and see if that network will connect @ 4GLTE. Anyone with suggestions on how to connect to AT&T 4GLTE please let me know. I have used the APN settings from AT&T website to no avail. I would give it 5 stars if not for the LTE issue. It will connect as 4G only NOT 4GLTE (San Antonio Texas)
"this model doesn't support samsung pay!!before you buy, you should know it!!"
I sm really happy with the product and the service provided
"The delivery of the phone was before time and the phone works flawlessly.. Do not worry about anything, you will never regret buying this device"
"I bought the S7 Edge and received it a few weeks ago. It is an excellent phone, however, it did freeze and had to be replaced. There are software flaws in the S7. Wireless Everything provided prompt service and I would definitely buy from them again."
It did meet my expection and I am so sati
product is as expected! had to return and the return pricess was also smooth
Decent phone no problems but at that price a warranty would of gave it 5 stars
"Be wary of the Edge phones. My husband dropped his from about 1 foot and the screen shattered. I have heard about this happening with other Samsung Edge products, but I have had so many phones and not once have the screens cracked so I thought I would be fine. I was wrong. I should have listened to others."
same as the one I would have gotten from AT&T except unlocked. The only difference is that samsung pay won't work yet.
Good phone and it lasted for 5 weeks!!
This is my 2nd Samsung Galaxy S7 as the privious one was stolen. I love every aspect of this phone. It worth every penny.
Excelent phone very recomended seller
Works perfectly and the product came nicely packed.
Perfect. Great phone
I already have this phone for about a month and I haven't found any problem with it. Is legit and works perfectly.
"I wanted to write this review mainly to share information on this product. The product reached well before said time. It was delivered in good condition. The phone is as equivalent to buying a samsung galaxy s7 edge in a carrier store.Only disadvantage that I have come across so far is - The samsung pay app doesn't work in this phone.So if you are interested in Samsung pay, you should consider other options."
Phone is faulty screen stopped working after 1month
Excelent product.
"I am very satisfied with S7 Edge, I have the international version. Fast charging, great photos and great screen."
Arrived early!! I was a bit hesitant getting the new S7 on amazon with not many reviews but Amazon hasn't failed me yet so I took the plunge and ordered it. I tested it with the Genuine Galaxy app and its a genuine unlocked Samsung phone. It works with my phone provider (in Jamaica). I am so in love with the phone.Everything is working really good.
"This phone is definitely one of the fastest on the market at the moment. I have dropped it several times on hard floors, and there is no visible damage at all. I have also handled it with wet hands, and it still works flawlessly. Although, the fingerprint scanner doesn't get along with water drips. The edge screen is a great addition, and I have gotten use out of the news feature when the phone is locked. The battery life is great, since it lasts about a day with moderate to heavy use.Also, for those who are wondering, this model supports most LTE bands, and it is also supported by most GSM carriers. I use it with Metro PCS, and it works perfectly."
Awesome
Fast and great
"Is a beautiful design, I a m getting used to it still many apps and actions that I need to control"
excellent! everithing ok! GREAT
The best android phone Samsung has ever made.
The phone is perfect!!!
Excelente
This phone is fantastic. That is all. Everything I can say has been said.
"Samsung has made an absolutely Spectacular Phone with the Galaxy S7 Edge. Perfect Size; fits and feels well in the hand. Easy to use, the touch screen is brilliant, easy to see even outdoors, clear and crisp and the special edge feature of the screen makes this the most beautiful cell phone ever made. And that is just the beginning.The Camera in the New Galaxy S7 rivals many of the cameras you can buy for hundreds and hundreds of dollars! You can take Incredible photos in low light, great videos, even HD Video recording and much more. Removable Storage has come back with the Galaxy S7 and now you can insert micro SD cards with as much as 200GB of storage.You pay for high quality and the Galaxy 7 isn't cheap. But it is well worth it. BUY The New Galaxy S7 - you won't be disappointed."
"I'm very happy with this phone, fast hasn't fail and I had it for a week, I will update if things change but overall it's a winner"
"I already did wrote a awesome review for this phone, I even inspired myself like I was writing a poem and I gave 4 star to the phone but after 1 month and some days of use it started giving me problems, the phone restarts randomly out of nowhere, that has happened like 5 times and the then today I was just playing music and the lockscreen didn't work and the whole screen went black and none of the buttons were working to turn on the screen so I had it to do a massive restart, good thing it didn't erased all my stuff. I don't know if it has warranty or not but I'll be happy if I get my $850 back that I worked so hard."
Good job! I found my item on time!!
"I am kind of angry to buy this and now I realized what the hack does international version mean. This is an international version which is far inferior to US counterpart. What I got is an Italian version. Some stupid Italian company's apps were pre-installed and cannot uninstall them.1. You cannot use Samsung pay with this version2. CPU is VFPv4 Neon which is far interior to the US version made by Qualcom3. I performed benchmarks with AnTuTu apps: SM-G935F (this model) is very under-performed. especially in graphics score 20781 (this model) vs 33831(Original US version) - this phone is around 35% under-performed than US conterpart.4. As I said, you cannot uninstall some stupid foreign cell-phone company's apps. Starting with foreign languages is a bonus.I hate Samsung to build these variations all the time to fool around the customers. Please check everything possible before you buy the Samsung products. AND buy US version all the time. This would not happen to Iphone which I used right before this one."
Switched from iPhone to this phone. After 1 week...No regrets.
<3 Great phone love it so far.
"I am coming from Note 3. Tried and returned the following phones:Nexus 6 – very poor battery life for massive screen, but overall quite good;Nexus 6P – very bad sound quality (low volume, very low volume), build quality (headphone jack broke in 10 days)I did not want to go with Samsung just for the fact that they do not stand behind their products and make their products obsolete and not supported after 2 years. Not acceptable for me, and my Note 3 still works great even though it is running in KitKat.But anyway, I was getting tired finding a good Android phone. By that time every manufacture has to produce a great phone, which has great OIS camera, good CPU, bright screen and be nice looking with strong materials. But looks like every manufacture is failing to do that. Some have good screens, bad build quality, some just bad battery, or bad internals. I see only Samsung is making something decent I can live with: Great design, strong body, good and stable software and have ability to root.So after multiple tries with others, I decided to go back to Samsung.Let me start with things I do not like about it.1. Edge screen is too sensitive and I think there should be an option to disable edge touch, or make it app specific. Forget about quality typing with one hand. You will always hit backspace or other keys on your right (if you are right-handed) with your palm. Waiting for a case to see if this going to help. This is huge -1 star for this device);2. Home button is still sticking out of the body. Why not to flash it so there are no accidental wake ups while in the pocket or somewhere else?3. Fingerprint is not good. Nexus 6P had the best and was fastest. Here it fails to recognize in a lot of occasions even while trying to set it up. BTW, why only 4 fingerprints can be setup. Why not more? I was setting up the same finger touching with different sides of the finger in case I need to unlock from different angles.Now what I like:1. Screen brightness – great. The best among all the phones on the market;2. Sound quality (music) over headphones and Bluetooth. BUT. Sound quality is not that good using original signal processing. I am very peaky for bass and treble. That is why I was looking for a phone, I can root and install Viper4Android to make phone sound perfect.3. Like headjack on the bottom, now you can slip you phone in the pocket without flipping it over to make headjack on the top while it is in your pocket.4. Completely unlocked phone vs Snapdragon model where bootloader is locked. I installed Custom Recovery, rooted phone, installed Wanam Xposed framework and Viper4Android. These pieces of software is a must for me. Wanam provided me with long press back button to kill process, long press volume keys to switch tracks, remove annoying popup when headset volume is high and some other features. And Viper4Android makes sound like no one else can produce.5. Always On Screen – love it. Does not look like it drains a lot of battery if at all;6. Build quality – gorgeous. Back does not feel glass though. But I am going to put case on it anyway.7. Battery – very easy to make though the day or two. Used it with Navigation and screen ON for 2 hour drive. Battery went down only 15%.8. Taking pictures – very good and I like the fact that it is wide angle. Both front and back camera took very good pictures even indoors, while at the dance competition. Focus is lightning fast.9. Connectivity – very strong and where my Note 3 or Nexus 6P were struggling for LTE signal (AT&T), Galaxy S7 was fine.10. Call quality – it feels like a person is just next to you. Very clear and solid.11. Glad that Samsung did not remove the option to scale screen. Unfortunately they only provide 2 options: Standard and Condensed, but at least something. Nexus 6P gave me more options from 400 dpi to 640 dpi. But I had Cyanogenmod running on Nexus 6P.12. Performance – very fast, no lags at all.13. Google Pay is working on it even I am rooted and have Wanam installed. Made first payment today and it was good.Overall looks like it is a keeper, but if edge screen sensitivity is not fixed, I will exchange that phone to Note 6 in the near future. (Hope they will not make it with curved edge – I hate it)."
"I just bought this phone a few weeks ago and Im just lovin it, great performance, awesome pictures, I love the display and how smooth is"
"I moved from ios to android and i felt like coming back home. Phone display , camera clarity amazing. Gold colour looks superb. Iphone 6 was so borning and this phone feels very exciting. Price was also good for unlocked international verson. Battary easily works for day and half with moderate data usage throught day"
thieves 😠
Best phone ever
Love mine it's awesome😍
I love it so much thank you! Cant believe I bought this expensive fone as a reward to myself. Too expensive but its ok I am very satisfied and happy! Thank you Amazon!
Rather expensive but meet all your expectations
Increíble! Gracias!
Fantastic
I rate this as a 100 % not a fake fun everything is fully clean
"the phone was good, the packaging was terrible"
Do not like it very much
Great phone. I just love it
Nice seller and excellent product.
Good phone

Samsung android phone is the best way to go. So glad they put the mini-sd storage back in.
"Amazing phone, totally better than the s7 normal. The edge rocks and is si much better in every aspect!!!"
Perfect!
Phone is amazing !
Cracked screen when opened...
Love it!!!
Perfect Phone. Recommend
pretty dopestill too much cash to drop on a phone without a removable battery.
"I like it, I love it"
"Amazing phone, don't know what to tell, one of the best in the world right now. The selller is very good, I ordered 2 of this.. and they are awesome..I tried it in water, battery is amazing. I am glad that I bought this one.. Thanks :)"
Great
"I purchased this S7 edge back in March. After two months, it started showing some screen color issues with annoying purple stripes all over the screen and the cellphone itself feels hot. I had to set the brightness to the maximum to temporarily ""avoid"" screen issues. And what's worse, the screen just died completely and I can't even turn off this phone since the screen is no longer functioning. Now I am trying to return this failed S7 edge and get my money back and never gonna buy any Samsung product again."
"excellent product, very good quality, I recommend"
exccelent product
"incredible, very satisfied and recommended"
Seal appeared to be broken when I first opened the package. Phone is the best I have ever experienced so far. Be careful with these international phones if you are a US buyer.
I am still in love with my samsung galaxy s7 edge a month later. I hope nothing will change.
This cell work perfect good.
Amazing unlocked phone! Currently using it in Mexico with a prepaid ATT Sim card and everything is great! Very high quality photos in front and in the back of the phone. The metal finish is very high quality! Love it!
"I got the exynos version. The phone works great. The phone is fast in switching between app and windows. The edge panel can be very useful if u arrange it to your need.Two best thing: the screen is wonderful - vivid colors very high brightness, one of the best screen by far; the battery - so powerful, i can use my phone for all day and the battery will not dead.Overall i am very-very satisfied with my s7 edge."

so much better than getting the ATT version of the phone no bloat ware and you can teather with out having to buy the extra service from ATT

Legit Company. The phone is brand new no issues... & these guys are fast!!!
Great
I have it for a about a year and works great!
"Screen failed in under 4 months. No warranty, no repairs. You are paying for a future $600 brick."
Works with American AT&T no problems. The 4g lte symbol does not show up but I know I get the speeds. Very happy that I purchased it
"Love this phone so far. It has been reliable and works as advertised. This is the international version, which means certain apps, like Samsung Pay, don't work. It's only come up a couple of times, but it is annoying. Not a negative on the phone, it's clear that this is the case. Just wanted to spread awareness."
"do not buy a international phone some features will not work,,,,,,,,, This seller is slow on returns"
"Good phone, nice design as almost everyone would agree. But it is very fragile! I drop mine from 2-3 feet high and got the screen edge shattered."
Wonderful
Good product
I love it
Love it. Using it with MetroPCS.
Amazing
very fantastic am really enjoying the it
Excellent!
"I wouldn't recommend buying it online, the phone I got came good but then started acting weird. When I would send out pictures it would not send. Another thing is that when i plug in my earbuds they only work on one side. I checked with many other earbuds and its still the same side, so therefore the phone is defected. The warranty isn't good as well, they would not provide you with a replacement phone while they have it for repairs. Me as a business owner, I can't go without my phone over 12 hours."
Very happy with the purchase.
Outstanding smartphone. I have been using a IPhone 6s and a Galaxy S6 Edge before. This smartphone beats both.
"Just what I want, a perfect gift for my wife"
"Love it, it came with usb adaptor and 110v adaptor!got an European version wich is great for me"
Great phone! My first Samsung and plan to continue with this brand!
"As soon as i got this i have yet to put it down, SUPER FAST, AMAZING SCREEN, its the dream phone i have been waiting for. Easy to transfer my data to the new phone, very thing and light, when i first held it i was like ""omg this thing is super light"" like i would drop it forgetting about the weight of it lol Only thing i was ""eh"" on about getting it was the seal was detached from the box(wasn't broken but the adhesive was rubbed off from shipping/warehouse), and the branding that usually says ""S7 Edge"" on the back is not on this model which i think is a good thing but made me feel for about an hour ""man i got a fake"" but it was not the case at all, it felt like the real deal. I checked the settings and the software is super snappy and easy to use, in the ""about phone"" section of settings it does say model number and the phone type as what it was advertised.PRO:~Amazing screen~Great build~Wireless Charging/Water Resistant(i have tried the water resistance and i say it works, had residue from the stickers and so i ran under tap water and cleaned that right off)(i have yet to try wireless charging yet)NEUTRAL:~Battery(it seems great but at the same time not so great. I woke up at 7am with 100% and then by 8:45am its at 85% so i still great but i feel by the end of the night ill have 10% left or less. I am a heavy user when it comes to my phone)CON:~Charger it comes with is foreign(my seller gave me an adapter with my phone, but i don't know if that's every purchase so be well aware it MAY NOT come with an American Adapter)As far as i can tell that's about it so far, i will update my review when and if anything changes. Yet to test wireless charging but plan on picking one up soon and will add an edit to this."
"It is good phone, came on time. It is not fake. Everything was good but my messanger is not working properly."
The phones features are great. The only thing is that... I've had the phone for a week and not dropped it once. Today the phone cracked when I dropped it... I was sitting on the floor when it slipped from my hand less than a foot up and the entire screen cracked. This material that it's made from is terribly fragile.
Great!
Vera Good!
Goodd nice
"I purchased it for my GF, she loves it...It was in GSM so the day I received it I went to Walmart purchased a Mano sim for 9.99 Go Phone. POP it in and it works great she still playing with it and learning the many feature"
This phone is a mess. I used to love the first months but now I don't have any signal( I tried 3 conpanies already) and is heaing up and freezing and starting the phone. Also my fingerprins don't work. I can't believe amazon is selling fake phones or damaged phones
Awesome smartphone!!! Too fast and it looks like the same as announced !! I received on time. Thanks!
The reception that I receive with this phone is HORRIBLE! I don't know how to fix this issue but i promise others will run into this problem. I'm not sure if it's because it's not optimized correctly for t mobile or what. It sucks honestly.
"Phone is great! It was a huge upgrade for me going from the Samsung Galaxy S5 to the S7 Edge. :) No problems as of yet, phone runs smooth and fast! I love the camera! The seller (Wireless Everything) was even kind enough to even include a US wall adapter along with the order."
Excellent product all on time
as advertised and totally pleased with
Excellent!!!!!
Everything was ok as far as I know. I got this for a gift and had it sent on to them so I would not receive it.
Great phone unloked. Work very good in US and Europe. Great customer service from amazon after a problem with the delivery
"Mailed out fast! Got it a day early! So glad i got the international version! And there is 4 reasons why.....Reason 1 - NOT FILLED WITH A TON OF BLOATWARE! No At&t crap apps. It does have a few like facebook and instagram. But most people use them and other than that just disable it....Reason 2 - Because it's the international version... We have the GALAXY LAB! Where you can get the app draw remove! which I enjoy. American Carriers Took it out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Reason 3 - Paying full price, I am not stuck in a contract for 2 years where the bill doesn't lower after the 2 years are up. OR not stuck in a monthly contract paying off the phone paying interest.Reason 4 - I HAVE NO STUPID CARRIER LOGO ON MY PHONE!!!! Such an EYE SORE and aggravation for a company to put there logo on another companies devise thats is sold off to the consumer.... its s***ty graffiti."
great phone
Awesome phone....
As advertised
Very good phone
The screen times out while I am using the phone. And my low light camera isn't functioning properly.
"Excellent product I love it. No regret for price paid, it really worth it."
I like it nothing was wrong with my phone the seal wasn't broken it the real Samsung galaxy s7 edge not fake so thanks
Amazing phone from a hardworking seller. Thanks!
Ok
This is the first phone I've had that didn't annoy me with its sluggishness. Battery lasts a long time.
I got what I was expecting. Thanks
All is great
"Everithing it's ok, the cell phone is amazing."
Because I think it is the best to have
great
"1) Great phone. Works as expected.2) Giving 5 stars for the great customer support, helped me to solve my issue really fast."
"Excellent product, it did came unlocked as mentioned with no trash applications pre-installed. It comes in the sealed Samsung box and comes with charger adaptor for America since it comes with a different charger for European wall plugs."
Amazing phone. Completely satisfied.
everything is perfect except the battery that doesn t last a complete day...
too much advertisement and getting hot too past.
Perfect
I hope this one can use a long time.....
"Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G935F- Black OynxAbsolutely disappointing, the charging port was hurt at 4 days, and today after 10 days has begun to smoke and smell of burning. I'll have to repair the ""new"" cell. I'm angry and I'll never buy in this shop."
"It is perfect this phone . First time that I bought a phone online and I had a very good experience . It's in very good condition and I got the phone next day . The only thing it's that on the back doesn't say ""galaxy s7 edge"""
"Bought this phone and have had it for several weeks. Absolutely love it ! fast and smooth, battery life is amazing. I'm with AT&T and if you can sacrifice wifi calling... this is the way to go. although it doesn't have all the LTE bands I have absolutely no trouble. My job requires me to travel often and I get great coverage everywhere, even in the gulf of mexico. I am now an exynos s7 edge fan boy."
Excelente Producto. Vendedor Recomendable
"if u have tmobile by this with confidence I was very hesitant at first people saying this is designed for a different region, until i remembered that I am middle eastern and the phone I previously bought was designed for middle east and worked great here in the US until I decided to upgrade, the only difference you will notice is the pre installed apps for the region and that chargers may have different inputs because it was designed for Europe or middle east, my seller that i bought from solved the charger issue by providing a complementary connectorgo for it, be brave for once."
"Everything went well, excelent product. Hope do not explode!"
i love my galaxy s7 i have no words
The unit tells me IT IS NOT registered On NETWORK and does not allow me to make calls.
"This phone is AMAZING. The display is gorgeous, it takes some time to get used but it totally worth it. This phone works great in argentina's network and i am having a pretty rough time trying to kill the battery it just doesn't want to give up."
all ok
Powerful tool!
Exelent Phone!
Great phone
Thanks amazing
"the phones is a very nice one , works great ..."

awesomw...!
Nice smartphone. Nice experience with seller.Maybe could be different type of charger. Anyway it's all right.
Works Perfect
"i bought this as a gift, my girlfriend loved it. she had an iphone 5, and dindt want to use android.But now, 1 month later, she regrests not making the transition before.great phone. i had no problem using it on tmobile or cricket network."
Excelent
"Good afternoon, this team that bought them, I was wrong. Does not work well, hangs up every few minutes. I have to remove the chip from the line for it to work. And then I bought it was for that, to use my line. I do not want this, I got damaged, I want my money back."
I had to return this great phone since the edge is way too sensitive and activates apps every time I touched the phone. Go for the 7 and not the 7 edge.
"It started off with buying one for my husband. Then I started playing around with his phone and fell in love with it myself. Had to buy a new one for me as well. One thing though, double check that it comes with an adapter for American outlets. My hubby's did, but mine did not."
It's Amazing 1+AAAAA
Excelent
Great!!!
Amazing one
"Sooo ummm I got it the next day after ordering it, which is crazy. I done my personal testing and I'm really Impressed makes my note 1 feel like a brick.... edited part: I dropped it in a huge puddle today sat for a good 7 mins under water, pulled it out and still works great"
Excellent
good
"Came in perfectly fine, works fine. Is sexy. Yes."
Love the phone I was a little scare at first because some of the paper instructions were in arabic but I put the phone to work without trouble manage to change the settings to english and spanish .It is a great phone charge really fast the adapter came for middle east kind of current but they were kind and send a travel adapter for it works great so far I am really happy thank you.
The phone was working pretty awesome then it just crashed and wouldn't turn on. Did all the troubleshooting I could and it still wouldn't turn on. So I had to return item.
"Excellent product, it cover al my expectations and more. The seller has a great attention."
Excelente
Loved!
I sm really happy with the product and the service provided
"The delivery of the phone was before time and the phone works flawlessly.. Do not worry about anything, you will never regret buying this device"
"I bought the S7 Edge and received it a few weeks ago. It is an excellent phone, however, it did freeze and had to be replaced. There are software flaws in the S7. Wireless Everything provided prompt service and I would definitely buy from them again."
It did meet my expection and I am so sati
product is as expected! had to return and the return pricess was also smooth
Decent phone no problems but at that price a warranty would of gave it 5 stars
"Be wary of the Edge phones. My husband dropped his from about 1 foot and the screen shattered. I have heard about this happening with other Samsung Edge products, but I have had so many phones and not once have the screens cracked so I thought I would be fine. I was wrong. I should have listened to others."
same as the one I would have gotten from AT&T except unlocked. The only difference is that samsung pay won't work yet.
"excellent product, highly recommendedClosed box wine"
Samsung> Iphone
"WOULDN,T TRADE IT FOR NOTHING ."
"I bought this cell some days ago and I couldn't be happier. This Latam version is working fine in Argentina. It's good to check before you buy if you cell works with in your country and carrier at [...] , very helpful...Thanks."
"The gadget works perfectly in Brazil, with VIVO 4G, but the battery life is poor."
Like
It's an excellent phone...
Very good
It stoped to work after 2 months. I am very disappoint.
"The features are OK, but it's not a great value. Not a huge step up from the Galaxy 6. If you have a Galaxy 6 edge and are looking to upgrade, hold off on this one. It's not groundbreaking stuff. More of the same."
Hi thereI ordered this samsung galaxy s7 on jun 17 nd everything was very very great until 2 week ago i just realized that in the screen there is one pixel wrong. Is almost imperseptible but if you focus on this pixel you can see how s*** it looks like
Techno master always send products that after 2 weeks you start seeing the defects. It has happened twice in less than 2 months.
Love the phone but the front glass cracked within the first month with no foreseeable way of having ii repaired for much less than the cost of a new phone.
Best phone I ever had. Period.
Love it
I love it. It's beautiful
I didn't even download one app and the phone started heating up to the point that I couldn't touch the sides of the phone. I reset it twice and the phone was leggy as if it was an s2. I'm getting another one and after that one doesn't work which it obviously won't seeing that this crappie one almost melted I'm reporting them as frauds.
Best phone ever u till the note 7
I love it
The cel phone came with a burned pixel that didnt fix... the rest was ok
The unit tells me IT IS NOT registered On NETWORK and does not allow me to make calls.
"This phone is AMAZING. The display is gorgeous, it takes some time to get used but it totally worth it. This phone works great in argentina's network and i am having a pretty rough time trying to kill the battery it just doesn't want to give up."
"Marvellous phone! Just as expected. Arrived some days late but I'm sure it was because the company ships all their orders in an specific date and that's why they offer several days or hours to order for the Prime Shipping. The first day I used it, It overheated A LOT, I was worried because I didn't want to return it after all the days I waited and the complication of waiting again for another one. But i searched the problem up and its normal for it to occur the first day, its setting up anyways, first day of startup. Until now, I've had it for about 2 months. The S7 Edge, exceeds expectations. Runs games smoothly and fast! The ability to switch apps and for them to stiill be active is amazing. Great phone, I'll update this soon with more information on how I'm doing with it."
"I really liked this phone, also I am so glad about amazon's services thank you for everything."
all according to expectations
Came with scratches on the lower right hand corner. Everything else was in good shape.
the phone just lasted two weeks then starts going freeze and doesnt turn on again
"Everything is perfect with the device but one of the sides of the box was ripped. Plus they gave me an adapter that works for England, not the US version."
the best phone out there
"excellent product smartphone came as I wait for Maracaibo, Venezuela 100% recommended"
"Phone is very sleek. it looks nice and it has a lot of things going for it.- Water Resistance- Amazing and Fast Camera- amazing screen- pretty fast charging- Good Battery- Fast Charging- Fingerprint Scannerand others.but for all of its pro's it has a few Big Faults. The big one for me was how hot the phone got. For just using google Maps, to even playing Pokemon go for a little bit in the park, the phone got so hot I could barely hold on to it. I couldn't even imagine using this with a case on it might melt. Then when the phone detects that it gets too hot then it makes that big beautiful display lowers it brightness to where I can not see in the daylight anymore. I am having a lot of issue with it in the Sun.I have heard of these issues with other Samsung phones. Maybe its just the ones with this certain processor, I am unsure if the SnapDragon ones have this issues but the reason I got the international is that it could go to any carrier more or less and I could get the added performance of the Exynos Processor. Turns out it was a bad idea and the phone got so unreasonably hot that I could barely hold on to it. The phone also got noticeably slower as it got hotter. Probably because the processor was limiting itself.Maybe this could be fixed with a software update but I think this is more of a hardware issue. Maybe I just got unlucky and got a defective phone as i don't see many other people mentioning these problems. I do not blame Samsung or have any bad feelings for them. I just got unlucky with my device and will be returning it to Amazon."
"5 stars to the phone, 0 stars to ATT. ATT was not able to get 4G connection going on this phone. Blamed hardware. IMEI checked good. Phone would show 4G AP but could not establish data connection with it. Was only working with 3G AP at 3G speed.The thing that did the trick was temporarily inserting SIM card from friend's phone that was connecting 4G. My phone made 4G connection right away. Means hardware is good. Put back my own SIM card. Voila, phone still connects at 4G!"
The best smartphone.I feel like a baby with new toy.
"Perfect size, amazing front camera and super fast phone..."
I received my phone on time and it's working perfect
Why does this phone have different features than my friends like this one say about device and my friends says about phone and MA you more stuff too but why
Amazing and beautiful!
"Best phone available today. Stunning 4K display, amazing camera and water proof....whaaaaatttttttt. Awesome."
Best phone ever! Happy and satisfied!
really nice phone
Great. Fabolous. I love it.
amazing phone and the service from this guys is absolutely exceptional
"nice product, easy to use, but both front and back crack very easily."
Everything perfect
Great product! Got the Italian version. Doesn't seem to be any different. Good battery life.
"Works perfect with the Brazilians (GSM) carriers. Nice and solid finishing. Noticeable improvement from version S6 (I have one). I wish it was for two SIMs, but's ok."
"EDIT: So after owning this for a few months, I'm dropping the rating solely because of the Edge touch screen. The fact is that I find it very annoying to use. The side of your hand touches it really easily, and it it makes typing or playing games on the phone very frustrating. The edge apps themselves are very few and far between and not that useful either. It's a pity since the phone itself is great, runs programs well, has great visuals and camera but actually using the thing is just frustrating. I'd suggest getting just the S7 to save yourself some money and comfort.The phone that arrived is the genuine article and works great--I'm thrilled with how well the battery and fast charging works even when playing Pokemon Go all the time. Also, I have T-Mobile and the phone works perfectly fine.However, even though the app is on your phone, the international model is not compatible with Samsung Pay. If you want that you need to get the American version of the phone. I wish I'd known this, but to me it was worth the savings in price and you can still use Android Pay. But I didn't realize this before buying it and I would have liked to have known."
"After a few hours of use,unexpectly turned off,then it begins lagging and acting weird,just talk to amazon for help, they didn't help me because it was bought through a freight forwarder.i really feel like a wasted my savings for nothing"
The cellphone is not unlocked like the wibsite describes. The cwllphone is locked by T-Mobile carrier
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Soon after purchase the screen became pixilated and flickers and eventually went black. Samsung claims they don't cover the international LATAM phones under their product warranty even though it was purchased in the USA for international travel purposes.
"Do not buy this phone it does not work and is NOT unlocked as advertised. This is false advertising and wasted my time and money. I now cannot call my family while deployed into war, wasted my time."
Great phone! Everything I use so far is good.Unblocked version it's so better than cell comapnies version because you save a lot of time non uninstalling app that you'll never use
The screen broke the first time I tried to use it.
A complete garbage! ! ! Don't buy it! You will lose a big amount of money! . After 2 month the screen became complete black. I contacted the seller and he said that the warranty with them was just for one month but he told me that I had one year of warranty with Samsung. .... I tried to contact to Samsung warranty in United States and in my country (Argentina ) and they both said that the year of warranty was only with the country where the phone was manufactured (Vietnam. ....seriously? ??)Well I wasted almost uss 700 in a phone that after 2 months stopped working and the only solution that I have gotten was to fly to Vietnam or spend uss 330 more tax to fix it in a no official cellphone center of technical support
I love my new cel phone.Fer

"Everything is good. Would be amazing, if my microphone worked though. Supermely annoying I can't make calls. Would have gotten a 5 star but because of this problem UT gets one"

"I usually read reviews bedore ordering anything, and therefore I was very anxious while ordering the phone. Various users various experiences.But for me, i got a good deal on device. I got it whithin a week. And its a Latin American version with US wall charger.And so far device is performing as it should be.10/10"
Excellent Very thank you
Fantastic
I rate this as a 100 % not a fake fun everything is fully clean

Do not like it very much

"Good phone, works great on AT&T. They can't block WiFi Hotspot with this phone. I have unlimited data grandfathered but was never able to use my phone as a Hotspot with an AT&T phone. Only drawback is it comes with a European wall plug."

Shipped in a reasonable time frame and worked with my carrier (t-mobile). First time I have ever bought a phone outside my carrier so I did a lot of research and I am well pleased with the result. The processor (this one has the international processor--much faster than the US processor) and battery life is wonderful!!! Right now it's 5:04pm and it's been off the charger & heavy use since 7am and I have 60% battery!
Fast delivery. Product awesome.
The mother board came broken and I cant do anything
"It's a great phone, i recomend!"
Cost-effective.Product delivered exactly as advertised.
No stars if I could I got a GS7 no edge
"I'm really pleased with the product,Met my expectations and the information provided by the seller is correct as the photos.I really recommend the product because for me it was very useful.I hope my comments were helpful"
I dislike this product is not working good
"Great display, good battery life"
"Excellent Phone, astonishing camera and amazing performance."
Perfect

"The phone is amazing! the screen is simply the best on the market right now. I read different comments about unreliable sellers selling fake or refurbished phones. I was lucky I bought mine from seller, theCoos. Got the phone new as described without problem."
"AWESOME phone. Came prepackaged, sealed, Turned on in English. There was an Arabic file of some sort - which I deleted. The model number matches correctly. No issues or problems getting it going and activated. Took it to my local AT&T store for the sim card and it took a little extra time and a couple of restarts, but after that everything is working great. I'm still learning some of the little tricks that come with it. The cell coverage shows ""4G"", not ""4GLTE"". I don't know the difference. The ATT guy said some would say it was better, LOL. I have no idea but, whatever. There are a few pre-installed samsung/google things. Smart Switch uploaded many things, but some things like ringtones were not backed up. I had to go looking for them. In the process, I also discovered some new ones. Battery is doing just fine and lasts as expected. It has it's own Samsung factory warranty - 1 year. I haven't been able to find any way to tell for sure if this is the snapdragon or xynos processor, but as I stated earlier, the model number matches, so....my first experience with an unlocked phone purchase on Amazon has gone well, IMHO. Thus far."
"The Samsung Galaxy S7 is perhaps the best mobile device right now. With so much technology, it has boosted the Galaxy S series. It is very easy to use and it makes you feel as if you don't have a mobile, instead you have so much more."
do not have samsung pay for international version. which is the main reason why I select samsung.
Device works fine and is fully unlocked and shipped in two days. All around good service
I'm kind of afraid that I wasted my money buying this considering all of the negative reviewsi just read. I surely hope that it works out when I receive it
"Good product, but a little defect. The home button make big noise when pressing it."
Thanks very good
Blazing fast and beautiful phone. Excellent camera
i can not use samsung pay and video calling facility in it.
Nice
It is working perfectly. I love it
very great phone i was abit worried when i ordered this but after recieving it using it i love it allot just some buyers know that with some carriers when u goto activate ur signal may just say 4g or lte or 4glte depends on where u r and ur carrier as for mine i have at&t usa and my signal says 4g i was hoping it would say 4glte maybe over time it will i dunno
good
Best cell phone ever. *****
"It's an awesome phone. The edge takes a little getting used to, but that's a small issue. Great camera, awesome sound in music and talking. Love the anti-glare. Seriously no glare from any angle. Even the headphones were great. Clear, crisp sounds. I bought the unlocked version and it works perfectly. Just had to insert the sim card and that was it. (And that's in the Caribbean) so for those customers wandering, it's definitely an Unlocked International Version. Highly recommended."
excellent service and product
Great
Excelent all
"Exynos processor. ISOCELL camera sensor. No Carrier bloatware. Suspiciously missing the Galaxy S7 Edge logo on the back shown in the photo. Aida64 shows the correct info, though.I've used the phone for over a week, now. I'm very happy with it. Still getting used to some aspects of the interface, but what it does, it does incredibly quickly. No lag in anything. Samsung has some nice features included. I love the health suite. I love the battery life.Cons: the duplicate apps. I want the ability to remove the browser, email app, etc. Things that I don't use. Things that Google also includes. Can't uninstall those either, surprisingly. Also, the whole Edge thing... There aren't enough ways to customize it or the edge notifications which display with the always on display. Also, the built-in so to transfer app data from your old phone didn't work with my HTC One."
I have been using this phone for three days now. I was impressed that the phone was delivered sooner than expected. The box was sealed and everything was intact. My only problem is that this phone came with a plug you use in Europe and where I live we use the plugs used in the US. Not a big problem since I can charge the phone with other chargers. I bought the international version since I read that the Exynos chip is better than Snapdragon. I previously used a Samsung S3 which recently died and it wasn't a difficult transition. I also have a P8 Lite which in my opinion takes better selfies. I'd still buy the S7 edge again though. The phone is very fast. Battery life is exceptional. I have only charged it once so far and it still has 52% of battery life left! I also love that the phone is very loud. The phone fits easily in my small hands and is pretty light. I also love being able to unlock the phone with my fingerprint. I also love that the speaker is very loud. For someone who's hard of hearing like me that is a plus!
"Less than ONE MONTH after I purchased this, it's gone wonky...randomly restarting even when I'm not using it, freezing then re-starting when I AM using it...I LOVE the S7 Edge, but I knew buying on Amazon was a BAD IDEA.If there's any way to exchange this item without having to go without a phone for a week, I want to exchange it...but I work from my phone and this is a real crap-storm right now."
"The device is a 100% win. The only aspect that I didn't really understand is that at the back of the phone it doesn't say ""Galaxy s7 edge"". Other than that it's a pretty awesome deal."
"I have received my Samsung Galaxy S7 G935F satisfactorily, NGP Store you are the Best! Thank you for the order. I will have present you for make more purchases in the future."
"The phone that was sold to me as unlocked is asking for a network unlock code.... this is BS, the phone is not actually unlocked. Wireless Everything is not telling the truth about this. If I don't receive any contact I can only conclude that I was taken to the cleaners and my money is down the rat hole."
"For reference, my previous phones were not flagship phones but rather they call under the budget/mid-range smartphone category. This may skew my review a bit since I'm going from mid range to flagship, but I think the Galaxy S7 Edge has so much going for it that it doesn't matter too much about my previous reviews.PREVIOUS PHONESNexus 5, OnePlus One, OnePlus Two, Nexus 5x, Honor 5xDESIGNThis phone is beautiful. Honestly, I love looking at this phone and I find myself wiping down the phone to maintain it's reflective silver reflection. In the day and age of large phones, the Galaxy S7 edge finds the perfect size.(To Be Continued. I'm writing this on my lunch break)SUPER AMOLED DISPLAYThe display on thisPERFORMANCECAMERABATTERY LIFE IS FOREVERWATERPROOFINGFINGERPRINT READERIf I had to fault this phone for anything, it would be the fingerprint reader. For some reason, my phone doesn't always recongnize my fingerprints. I've reset them a couple times and it still doesn't always read it correctly. My last three phones had fingerprint readers and they were all quicker or more accurate than the S7 Edge. I suspect that it's because the home button is very short (height-wise) and that the home button is raised.FEATURES FEATURES FEATURES"
"I purchased it for my GF, she loves it...It was in GSM so the day I received it I went to Walmart purchased a Mano sim for 9.99 Go Phone. POP it in and it works great she still playing with it and learning the many feature"
This phone is a mess. I used to love the first months but now I don't have any signal( I tried 3 conpanies already) and is heaing up and freezing and starting the phone. Also my fingerprins don't work. I can't believe amazon is selling fake phones or damaged phones
Amazing phone
Absolutely love the phone. Best purhase I ever made!
"The screen, the edge, pictures are GORGEOUS! What's not to love!"
Like very much.
"I'm really liking this phone. To be fair this is my first flagship phone. I'm coming from a cheap Nokia Lumia 520 but figured for once I'd splurge and see what all the fuss is about on these top tier phones.The first thing I noticed is that the screen is absolutely beautiful. I couldn't get over how clear and lifelike everything looked. Also being able to actually see my phone's screen in the sun was a definite plus haha. OLED is just an awesome technology and I can't wait until TV manufacturers tweak the picture processing a bit. Just a great display.I haven't run benchmarks or anything but everything on the phone is very snappy. Going into the camera, opening/switching apps, playing games, watching movies, etc. all ran smoothly. I didn't notice any warmth or the phone running hot but that probably due to using a case. The call quality was fine and overall I'm really enjoying it.On the down side, I think the phone's a little awkward to hold or picking up from a flat surface. I got this case Galaxy S7 Edge Case, SUPCASE Full-body Rugged Holster Case WITHOUT Built-in Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (2016 Release), Unicorn Beetle PRO Series - Retail Package (Black/Black) and the rubber edges made a world of difference. It's no longer slippery and easy to pick up off of a flat surface. Nothing worse than paying for a phone like this only to drop it while trying to set it up!The only thing I'm hoping is that the battery lasts quite a long time. Not having easy access to it is kind of a bummer. As I just dropped nearly $750 on it and I don't upgrade phones every year I'm hoping it lasts awhile. As much as I really do like this phone I don't think I'll be spending this much on a phone again. The purchase was more to quell my curiosity about these high end phones so I can check that off my bucket list hahaI purchased the phone from Wireless Everything and it arrived brand new in a sealed box with all new components. I popped my SIM card in and I was off to the races. I never purchased an international phone so was a bit nervous but everything went extremely well. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative I would suggest the OnePlus3 or ZTE Axon 7. Very similar specs for 400 smackaroos."
Love it's very nice looking and the camera is outstanding.
"The phone keep freezing ,"
Love my new phone takes amazing pictures battery life is long lasting and works perfectly with straight talk 😊
Switched from an iPhone 5 and so glad I did. This is an amazing phone!
Good products
i only had my phone for about 3 weeks and the screen start jumping rapidly
The phone is good except the phone's charger is not the US version.
very good quality Amazon good job
"Telephone edge Dandy Yes, it's a phone in the top extravaganza I've loved phone I am very happy very, very strong"
"Love the phone I bought (black onyx). Works very well. Great camera, great screen sensitvity and charges quickly. The only downside is that I have to use a converter with the fast charging cord. I find it cumbersome although it works well. I guess it was made for a British market."
"It's everything i hoped for in a cellphone. It is fast, beautiful,though the camara doesn't really take great pictures in low light or dark spaces. Eveything else is just perfect!"
You can't go wrong this phone is awesome....
the machine.very good
"I bought this phone for my dad and he is in love with it. It has fast-charging and all the high end specs that you could ask for in a top tier device. I don't know much about it, besides the fact that there hasn't been any issues thus far. It's got some interesting features and is a pleasure to use, I can tell you that much!"
Love this phone. Super fast. Screen is nice and big. Loaded with a bunch of great features.I connected it with cricket. Only 55 a month get great signal (cricket uses att towers)So i get nice fast connection with a low monthly cellphone bill.
it Was perfect
"Shipped immediately, phone is amazing! Very happy with this purchase!!"

"Did not come with charger adapter as expected, otherwise its PERFECT"
Best Galaxy ever. Amazing.
"Updating my review. I specifically ordered the LATAM version as I work in South America. Constant connection drops and errors on my home network in Peru (Claro). Claro has replaced my SIM twice and the problems still arise. Couldn't connect in Ecuador on a standard GSM network that my S5 had connected to for years. Guatemala, couldn't hold a connection either that my S5 had used for years as well. I have a $700 top of the line network only device. Thankfully I still have my S5. I would not trust this seller to send you the specific version you need for your region."
"Dropped once, front and back completely shattered, >300$ repair costNot only did the front and back glass spiderweb after a single drop, the phone itself started glitching and now it won't even turn on. Apparently dropping it voids the warranty so now I have a 600$ paperweight. This will be my final Samsung phone."
Good.
Yes. Everything was perfect . Thanks
Birthday gift for my brother. He loved it too death.
"so far so good,loving the phone,genuine and clean"
I got this phone and it was not working properly. I called and spoke with a representative and he stated he would send out another phone but never did and I waited a week then had to call back and get another phone. The screen stopped working.
Delivery came on time. Definitely pleased with my new phone!
Nice
Perfect!
Phone is amazing !
Cracked screen when opened...
Love it!!!
Perfect Phone. Recommend
pretty dopestill too much cash to drop on a phone without a removable battery.
"I like it, I love it"
"Amazing phone, don't know what to tell, one of the best in the world right now. The selller is very good, I ordered 2 of this.. and they are awesome..I tried it in water, battery is amazing. I am glad that I bought this one.. Thanks :)"
"I live in the UK, but had this delivered to a friend's address while I completed a road trip from Miami to San Francisco. The delivered product was well packaged and was originally intended for the Middle East market. A big bonus for me is that the supplied charger uses a UK-style 3-pin plug. While hardly a big deal as I, like most people, have the world's supply of USB power adapters. Considering that this purchase has saved me quite a bit of cash over outright purchase in the UK, I'm very happy.Powering up the phone for the first time shows a single application for the intended market which was deleted as I have no use for it. I've owned Android phones previously, but have been using an iPhone 6 Plus for the last year. I've since fallen out of love with iOS as it's just too inflexible and is becoming somewhat childish in terms of interface. Samsung's implementation of the Android platform is smooth, highly-polished and commendable. It's not as fast as the pure product in the Nexus lineup, but does not suffer as all as a result.The octacore processor in the non-US model is just pure sweeping power. It's a good thing that the battery is a hefty 3500mAh unit or it wouldn't last the day. That said, if you're the kind of user who has multiple applications running all day long - and I'm among that userbase - this phone will take it all in its stride and not break a sweat. The screen is absolutely beautiful without being too highly saturated, the cameras (both front and back) are immensely capable and the return of expandable storage through cheap and capacious micro-SD cards is very welcome.Physically, the phone is svelte, lightweight and sits in the hand beautifully. Even without a case, there's no feeling that you'll drop it at any moment. One of the finest physical features is the waterproofing that doesn't require that you slap chunks of rubber into the ports to maintain its integrity. no more panics when you're caught in that torrential downpour about your phone suffering a premature demise.I haven't tried any of the included accessories such as the micro-USB cable, charger or earbuds as I already have very high quality 3rd-party versions. From the look of them, they appear to be reasonable quality.For anyone in the US who's concerned about losing out on network connectivity by using a phone from an overseas market, rest assured. I used a SIM card linked to T-Mobile's 4G network and had absolutely no issue anywhere with obtaining a good strong 4G signal. The Exynos processor in the US market model, while likely perfectly adequate, will almost certainly be that touch slower than the beast in the overseas market product.If you're like me, fear running out of power when you're away out all day and carry a power bank, know that the quick charge 2 feature has this from about 5% to fully charged in around an hour. The genuine Samsung quick charge puck may be slower to re-add the juice, but it's utterly convenient when you're a tired and then don't have to worry about not quite plugging the phone in to charge.If you're seeking to buy a phone without the burden of a contract, do yourself a big favour: Save some money, get this model, use one of the probably five or six wall chargers you already have and enjoy this incredible handset. It may be coming from outside of the US, but it's delivered quickly and I have no doubt whatsoever that it'll be loved every bit as I love mine. This is the best phone I've ever had, and the added bonus of saving on the cost of purchasing outright through Best Buy, etc is the icing on an already very delicious cake."
Got horizontal lines on display within few days of usage. Unable to return it because the timeline to return has expired :(
<3 Great phone love it so far.
"I am coming from Note 3. Tried and returned the following phones:Nexus 6 – very poor battery life for massive screen, but overall quite good;Nexus 6P – very bad sound quality (low volume, very low volume), build quality (headphone jack broke in 10 days)I did not want to go with Samsung just for the fact that they do not stand behind their products and make their products obsolete and not supported after 2 years. Not acceptable for me, and my Note 3 still works great even though it is running in KitKat.But anyway, I was getting tired finding a good Android phone. By that time every manufacture has to produce a great phone, which has great OIS camera, good CPU, bright screen and be nice looking with strong materials. But looks like every manufacture is failing to do that. Some have good screens, bad build quality, some just bad battery, or bad internals. I see only Samsung is making something decent I can live with: Great design, strong body, good and stable software and have ability to root.So after multiple tries with others, I decided to go back to Samsung.Let me start with things I do not like about it.1. Edge screen is too sensitive and I think there should be an option to disable edge touch, or make it app specific. Forget about quality typing with one hand. You will always hit backspace or other keys on your right (if you are right-handed) with your palm. Waiting for a case to see if this going to help. This is huge -1 star for this device);2. Home button is still sticking out of the body. Why not to flash it so there are no accidental wake ups while in the pocket or somewhere else?3. Fingerprint is not good. Nexus 6P had the best and was fastest. Here it fails to recognize in a lot of occasions even while trying to set it up. BTW, why only 4 fingerprints can be setup. Why not more? I was setting up the same finger touching with different sides of the finger in case I need to unlock from different angles.Now what I like:1. Screen brightness – great. The best among all the phones on the market;2. Sound quality (music) over headphones and Bluetooth. BUT. Sound quality is not that good using original signal processing. I am very peaky for bass and treble. That is why I was looking for a phone, I can root and install Viper4Android to make phone sound perfect.3. Like headjack on the bottom, now you can slip you phone in the pocket without flipping it over to make headjack on the top while it is in your pocket.4. Completely unlocked phone vs Snapdragon model where bootloader is locked. I installed Custom Recovery, rooted phone, installed Wanam Xposed framework and Viper4Android. These pieces of software is a must for me. Wanam provided me with long press back button to kill process, long press volume keys to switch tracks, remove annoying popup when headset volume is high and some other features. And Viper4Android makes sound like no one else can produce.5. Always On Screen – love it. Does not look like it drains a lot of battery if at all;6. Build quality – gorgeous. Back does not feel glass though. But I am going to put case on it anyway.7. Battery – very easy to make though the day or two. Used it with Navigation and screen ON for 2 hour drive. Battery went down only 15%.8. Taking pictures – very good and I like the fact that it is wide angle. Both front and back camera took very good pictures even indoors, while at the dance competition. Focus is lightning fast.9. Connectivity – very strong and where my Note 3 or Nexus 6P were struggling for LTE signal (AT&T), Galaxy S7 was fine.10. Call quality – it feels like a person is just next to you. Very clear and solid.11. Glad that Samsung did not remove the option to scale screen. Unfortunately they only provide 2 options: Standard and Condensed, but at least something. Nexus 6P gave me more options from 400 dpi to 640 dpi. But I had Cyanogenmod running on Nexus 6P.12. Performance – very fast, no lags at all.13. Google Pay is working on it even I am rooted and have Wanam installed. Made first payment today and it was good.Overall looks like it is a keeper, but if edge screen sensitivity is not fixed, I will exchange that phone to Note 6 in the near future. (Hope they will not make it with curved edge – I hate it)."
"I just bought this phone a few weeks ago and Im just lovin it, great performance, awesome pictures, I love the display and how smooth is"
"I moved from ios to android and i felt like coming back home. Phone display , camera clarity amazing. Gold colour looks superb. Iphone 6 was so borning and this phone feels very exciting. Price was also good for unlocked international verson. Battary easily works for day and half with moderate data usage throught day"
thieves 😠
Best phone ever
Love mine it's awesome😍
I love it so much thank you! Cant believe I bought this expensive fone as a reward to myself. Too expensive but its ok I am very satisfied and happy! Thank you Amazon!
OK
so good <3
Good product
I love it
Love it. Using it with MetroPCS.
Amazing
very fantastic am really enjoying the it
Excellent!
"I wouldn't recommend buying it online, the phone I got came good but then started acting weird. When I would send out pictures it would not send. Another thing is that when i plug in my earbuds they only work on one side. I checked with many other earbuds and its still the same side, so therefore the phone is defected. The warranty isn't good as well, they would not provide you with a replacement phone while they have it for repairs. Me as a business owner, I can't go without my phone over 12 hours."
Very happy with the purchase.
The best phone ever. Great camera. Buy it.
phone would not work unless plugged into the charger and its got an internal battery so i had to return it brand new phone
exccelent product
"excellent product, very good quality, I recommend"
"incredible, very satisfied and recommended"
Seal appeared to be broken when I first opened the package. Phone is the best I have ever experienced so far. Be careful with these international phones if you are a US buyer.
I am still in love with my samsung galaxy s7 edge a month later. I hope nothing will change.
This cell work perfect good.
Amazing unlocked phone! Currently using it in Mexico with a prepaid ATT Sim card and everything is great! Very high quality photos in front and in the back of the phone. The metal finish is very high quality! Love it!
"I got the exynos version. The phone works great. The phone is fast in switching between app and windows. The edge panel can be very useful if u arrange it to your need.Two best thing: the screen is wonderful - vivid colors very high brightness, one of the best screen by far; the battery - so powerful, i can use my phone for all day and the battery will not dead.Overall i am very-very satisfied with my s7 edge."
"Bought this for my teen, he loves it!"
"I ordered this phone which was branded as an original but it was completely fake. Not only was the Samsung brand not on the back of the phone, but also the features of the phone event the writing was different from the original phone."
I was completely satisfied!
My seller Wlaphones did all as promised. They sent the phone in 2 days and had no problem no change the delivery address since I moved and totally forgot to make the change. 5 stars to the seller and 5 stars to the phone. I've had it for around 2 weeks and had no problems to activate it in TMobile. Amazing phone and great seller
"Is not a Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE.(SM-G935F) .It's a regular Galaxy S7 (SM-G930F)..accidental mistake or intentional error , But it's not the product that I payed for..I'am realy furious ..Be Carefully .."
The seller was good. They send me a sealed box. The problem is the phone. I bought it to use in Argentina. When I opened the phone in Argentina there was a pink line on the screen. It's a full pixel dead line across the screen. Y search on internet and it is a common problem with the edge phones and the solution is a new module/screen. There is no guaranty for me here.
"This phone is absolutely amazing. I could go on about the class leading camera, the all-day battery life, the amazing screen, the unquestionably useful Always On Display. That's probably not the most impressive thing about this phone though. Think about an iPhone 6/6S/7 Plus. Now think of the most annoying problem with that phone. If you're like me then the most annoying problem is undoubtedly the ENORMOUS bezels on the side of the phone. For those of us who want a bigger screen (because it usually means more features/a better viewing experience) the iPhone is damn near impossible to hold in the hand because after the screen ends, there is a huge swath of space on the sides that add several critical millimeters to the width of the phone. Not with this phone. The curved display not only looks amazing, but serves to give the phone a very compact footprint for the 5.5"" screen you are getting.That being said, there are things I don't like. Samsung still needs to make their software more stable and less energy inefficient. The longevity is more a virtue of the large battery than the software. Additionally the software can sometimes have funny quirks. Nothing too bad, but just things that are a little weird or slow sometimes.I also recommend that you buy a case for this phone. More than anything else on the market it's a work of art and you'll want to preserve it. I personally recommend this: Spigen Thin Fit Galaxy S7 Edge Case with SF Coated Non Slip Matte Surface for Excellent Grip for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 2016 - Black. This case is thin and almost feels like it isn't there. It'll make your phone easier to grip and give you piece of mind while you're out all day with it."
Received the phone and it was cracked
"Don't buy anything from this seller/company. I bought a Samsung Galaxy s7 edge, not even 2 months after the cell phone stopped working, Plus they don't accept returns."
Pretty nice phone. it looks great. it is very fast and i love the camera.
"Be careful , It comes with UK Plug ."
"Excellent screen, fast, good battery life, has met my expectations."
I hope this one can use a long time.....
"Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G935F- Black OynxAbsolutely disappointing, the charging port was hurt at 4 days, and today after 10 days has begun to smoke and smell of burning. I'll have to repair the ""new"" cell. I'm angry and I'll never buy in this shop."
"It is perfect this phone . First time that I bought a phone online and I had a very good experience . It's in very good condition and I got the phone next day . The only thing it's that on the back doesn't say ""galaxy s7 edge"""
"Bought this phone and have had it for several weeks. Absolutely love it ! fast and smooth, battery life is amazing. I'm with AT&T and if you can sacrifice wifi calling... this is the way to go. although it doesn't have all the LTE bands I have absolutely no trouble. My job requires me to travel often and I get great coverage everywhere, even in the gulf of mexico. I am now an exynos s7 edge fan boy."
Excelente Producto. Vendedor Recomendable
"if u have tmobile by this with confidence I was very hesitant at first people saying this is designed for a different region, until i remembered that I am middle eastern and the phone I previously bought was designed for middle east and worked great here in the US until I decided to upgrade, the only difference you will notice is the pre installed apps for the region and that chargers may have different inputs because it was designed for Europe or middle east, my seller that i bought from solved the charger issue by providing a complementary connectorgo for it, be brave for once."
"Everything went well, excelent product. Hope do not explode!"
i love my galaxy s7 i have no words
Great
"I purchased this S7 edge back in March. After two months, it started showing some screen color issues with annoying purple stripes all over the screen and the cellphone itself feels hot. I had to set the brightness to the maximum to temporarily ""avoid"" screen issues. And what's worse, the screen just died completely and I can't even turn off this phone since the screen is no longer functioning. Now I am trying to return this failed S7 edge and get my money back and never gonna buy any Samsung product again."
"this is the best cell phone I have. The size is almost the same as Samsung S5, except the format edge give us a very pleasant touch and view! The camera is exceptional, have auto focus and it is impossible to have bad pictures. The only problem is that it is so sensitive that a single harder touch can become multiple pictures..This is definitely the BEST SAMSUNG S series phone, and if the money is not the problem, forget the S7 and go to the S7 Edge!!!"
Great product so far..
S7 edge is the best
So far no!!!!!! I ordered the Samsung galaxy s7 EDGE GOLD and received the regular s7 in silver like wtf
"Very good phone. It's an international version, with adapter."
Excellent
Excelent!!
Excelente gracias
Has lots of cool and helpful features. Performance is very good. I highly recommend purchase if you are considering switching or upgrading
I received the wrong power plug. Did not get the US type.
"The phones arrived as described factory unlocked, unopened in new condition"
Love love my phone!
"excellent product,works great"
Very good mobile
Cheap flimsy quality.
great phone
"As expected, arrived on time and working perfectly with 2 Simms"
"Had to get rid of my Galaxy Note 7 due to the well publicized issues. Replaced it with the S7 edge. Nice phone but NOT as functional. No Stylus, No screen scroll capture, smaller screen. In general, an ok temporary replacement but SAMSUNG has better get something on the market that has the Galaxy Note 7 features (without the meldtowns)."
Everything ok!!!
"Do not purchase. Bought this phone a few months ago and now I have a row of dead pixels. Never dropped or had water damage. It was fine in the morning and when I took it out of my pocket, I noticed the pixels died. For me, it goes away randomly and always returns in an hour or so."
It a very nice phone
Love this phone. So fast and smooth. Lots of great features.
"I FIRST EXPERIENCE ONLINE PHONE ORDERBUT REALY GOOD EXCELLENT, I M HAPPY WITH AMAZON SHOPING, AND I REALY LIKE AMAZON SHIPPING ORDER TRACKING SYSTEM."
The phone is exactly wath i expected! The only thing that i can't test if it work in Romania! In rest the phone is awesome!
"Amazing. Been using it for the past few months now. No scratches, no shatters. Perfect. Performance is fast. I dig it."
nice phone I love it
Excellent product.
"This phone appears to be exact same phone as sold in US, but the seller did include a simple plug adaptor so you can plug it into 110 v in US. Otherwise, the plug it comes with looks like the plug they use in Spain households. The phone is Duel Sim card and unlocked, but what itsn't stated is that you can have 2 SIM cards OR, 1 SIM card and 1 microSD card (which I put a 128 GB card in). I expecting it to allow all 3 at the same time. No biggy though.The phone itself looks Spectacular and the screen seems to kind of repel dust, to some extent (I baby the phone, in general). The graphics are great. I haven't registered for Samsung Pay yet, but this phone appears to allow it OK. The battery seems pretty good, and it charges VerY fast!!Also, I had apple iphone before this, and would say this is, so far, quite a bit nicer than the iphone 5 or 6. I would recommend to anyone concerned about switching from Apple to Samsung......Also, one thing that made the change Super easy was that the phone had a very small gadget in the box that allows anyone with an Apple to hook up to the new phone and it will automatically download ALL of your photos, videos and complete set of Contacts.....that was a huge relief, and that's why I hadn't changed in past. Would highly recommend the Galaxy S7 Edge. Hope this info helpful!!"
"Beware of this product guys: I bought this unlocked Samsung Galaxy phone. It is not fully compatible with T-Mobile and I am assuming that AT&T and other carriers will be the same. Important features like LTE support and wifi calling will not work. Moreover, Samsung USA does not support this phone. They asked me to talk their Asian counterparts for any issue. All in all, its waste of money."
"WARNING!! this is a fake cellphone, don't buy"
"Everything as expected, the description readed in reviews and on Samsung webpage, are pretty acurrate."
It seems that his is the best smartphone who was created in this period !
"Perfect! I got everything fast. The box was sealed, phone's excellent! Love it!!!"
returned because it came open the safety seal
It says the phone is not compatible with samsung pay? Why what is the issue
The package is empty.Whats Happened????? I need a explain!
Very fast shipping and very fast phone... Really great!
I upgraded to this phone from a Galaxy Note III and it is loads better - faster; better screen; much better camera (LOVE the camera). The display is so clear and colourful it is simply a joy to hold and behold. Any drawbacks? You do have to hold it carefully so you aren't pressing the wrap-around screen and confusing it with what you want to do. Worth it? you bet
Everything is OK with the phone.only the smart screen shot cant use.i don't know why.i tried a lot of time.
The phone is a phenomenal piece of equipment. I was a previous Note 5 user and have found this phone superior in every way. I only miss the stylus for performing detailed writing task but otherwise I love the speed and display. The battery life is quite good as well. It makes it through an entire day without having to be charged!
Good
I love my phone
Switched from iPhone 6 ... so much better!!!
Way better than i expected.The battery is the best that I ever saw.
Dual SIM International Version!
"Everything you've read about this phone is true. It is amazing. The screen is second only to the S7 (in terms of ppi), the camera is arguably the best on the market, and it is a monster in battery life and performance. Silver Titanium is undoubtedly the best color. Absolutely stunning. If Samsung found a way to implement stereo audio, it would be perfect, but it makes up for what it lacks in sound quality in its relative loudness and top of the line headphone output. Rest assured that you are buying the best phone on the market right now.--------------------------------Compliment it with a Spigen Neo Hybrid Crystal (I 100% recommend Gunmetal for a Silver Titanium GS7 Edge): http://amzn.com/B01AUORACQand a Armorsuit Case Friendly Screen Shield: http://amzn.com/B01ACXSKAG"
Great
I got my new galaxy s7 duos and the package came on time and good status.
Excellent
Package received without the actual phone which was probably stolen on the way
"all very correct, fast , good priducto ."
"I bought mine from NPG USA Store, was shipped from hong kong but everything looks great. Works fine, a adaptor was also included with the phone."
"S7 edge is an excellent phone, but the seal was broken (hence opened). And I can't download Samsung Pay from Google play store!! Which is a big disappointment! It shows that Samsung Pay isn't compatible with this device!"
"it is no doubt that s7 edge is a good phone,but it is opened by someone,the seal is broken.and i can't download Samsung Pay from Google play store. it shows that Samsung Pay doesn't compatible with this device."
"Back glass got cracked after half a day of use - I didn't even drop the phone - just got it hit the door in the pocket of my hoody. Probably it's not about the phone itself, but about this particular vendor - I've heard there are models on sale with cheaper back. The packaging was strange as well - for international version I would expect something different from singaporian plug."
Arrived timely manner.Great product.
Excellent!
"disappointed, phone developed 3 grey lines across screen after two months and no mishandling of device"
The best phone in the world
All ok
excellent
Loving this phone more and more

"Came perfect, works great, and is so beautiful. I had no problems with switching my sim card over to this. I am so in love with this phone. It's beautiful, amazing and takes phenomenal photos. It's so beautiful."
I really like this product. It's so powerfull.

Excellent
It is very intuitive and easy to use.
Why my cell phone is not same with picture of the back
Loved It !
Excellent phone. two thumps up
"Delivered on time, the best cell of all. Great screen, easy and comfortable handling. Great long lasting battery. Incredible pictures. Love my cell!!!!!"
awesome
"Ecxellent seller, high recommended"
I'm still seeing how it works for the Casio men`s
"Excellent product. Work on all gsm networks around the world. In USA works great with AT&T and T-Mobile. My comes with UK ac adapter, if you want to use at another countries you need to buy an appropriate Ac adapter."
Excelent!! The box was sealed really new in perfect condition. Congratulation!!
"Outstanding phone. Great features and the curved edge is great. Haven't had issues with this beauty. Most complaints I do not understand, unless they have personal problems. I've attached photo of the adapter that comes with it."
One of the best phones I've ever used. Got the Asian variant. Everything works well. Perfect condition.
"Great phone, so far I have used it in Canada as well as the states. Will see how it works in Europe next. My only gripe is losing one of the sim cards to the SD card for expanded memory. There is a hack for this but I haven't done it yet. It involves sticking the sim chip to the back of the SD card to have a dual slot."
"It's a shame that you have to choose between placing SIM2 or MicroSD. In previous versions of DUOS you could use SIM1, SIM2 and MicroSD simultaneously."
"The most ugly phone on the high end market. Ugly oblong shape, cheap shiny plastic look, ugly design of icons, oversaturated colors even in basic mode, and messy organization of apps and screens. Extra features like pulse sensing have marginal value at best. Good features: dual simm, large screen size to phone size ratio, low weight, waterproofing do not fully compensate for ugly design. Given a chance I would go for any other phone, especially HTC."
Fast and responsive
"Excellent phone, well worth the money over the S7 due to the larger screen. This is not a fake, it is the real deal. The phone I received is an international version (dual sim) from the UAE. It came with a UK charging plug."
"Chose an 'international' model, so I can use while stationed in China and USA... actually, I loved it for 2 months, then it developed a problem which i learned was common, thick gray bars on the screen, and which should easily and clearly be under Samsung's warranty, however I have discovered that the warranty is only good in Singapore, and nowhere outside Singapore. Wasted time on the phone with Singapore, and finally learned that I am out of luck, need to pay to get it repaired. So, BEWARE!!!!!!! I am screwed with a $700.00 POS."
Excelente
Product was received as advertised. Very pleased with delivery time.
"It's wonderful, exactly what I needed"
muy buen producto
Works very well in Africa - Unlocked
"My phone dead, don't know why? Can't not turn on at all"
every thing went fine according to expectation.
"best phone i had so far, love it"
"Very good telephone with lots of features. I have the dual sim card, and it operates nicely... pictures are great.Only drawback, the dual sim uses the same space for the dual sim and for the memory expansion slot."
Love it.
We bought this S7 Edge to use it in Argentina (Movistar network) and it works perfectly well!
Excellent cell phone I am using two SIMs from México without problemsHighly recommended
very good quality I really like works very wellI give 5 stars
It's a wonderful phone
Wrong chargerScreen problem
It's nice but there's something wrong with the LCD display.
So Good
"I've owned many different phones over the years. My first real smart phone was a Samsung S3 and was a great phone. I recently purchased this S7 Edge and can say it is the best phone I've ever had. I recommend getting the International version like mine. All the chatter about it on the Web is spot on. It is the fastest, smoothest, best of everything in a smart phone that money can buy today. My ONLY complaint is that TouchWiz needs more work. I really want to use it but ended up back to Nova launcher to get basic features, like vertical app drawer scroll and such. TouchWiz needs more features control to truly be useful. However this has nothing to do with how wonderful the S7 Edge International 935FD truly is!"
Great device!
Looks and work beautifully. Recommend to purchase from this vendor
"Hated sending it back but this international version wouldn't work with TMo or ATT SIMs properly. Love the S7 Edge though. This dual SIM version wouldn't handle the two carriers cellular data properly. Once on wi-fi it would rarely transition to cell data without a reboot. Even then it didn't like two SIMs from different carriers. Suspect it is meant for two SIMs from the same carrier only. If I inserted a single SIM only, it worked better, but oddly my TMo SIM only got less than 1Mbps on band 12 LTE when the same SIM in a different phone pulled 15+Mbps consistently. ATT speeds when only 1 SIM inserted were consistent with other phones. If I can only use one SIM I might as well buy a single SIM US version so that wi-fi calling and VoLTE could work too, which they don't on this international version.Beyond the dual SIM issues, the Galaxy S7 Edge was a great phone. Awesome camera. Nice display."
awesome phone
Good
"All good, product (s7), delivering (Amazon.com)"
Got this phone for my husband and he absolutely love it!
"Could bem the right charger, im from brazil and is totaly different, i had to buy a new charger."
Excelente
magnificent
Everything is OK. Except the power plug is not fit to most socket.
Excelente
"another sim or microsd, you can't use two sims and the sd card at the same time"
Just greater Just great
Its gratis.
Incredible cellphone !!!
A good product
"Dual SIM unlocked (DUOS version, SM-935FD), awesome phone !Dual SIM capabilities were key to my purchase decision. This is an international version of the phone, comes carrier unlocked. I just popped my GSM / T-Mobile SIM card from my old phone (HTC One M8) into my new Samsung S7 Edge, and I was on the T-Mobile network in NYC. Do your research on LTE bands, but this phone has all the LTE bands that T-Mobile uses in the US, so I have great reception and 4G LTE available. I highly recommend for anyone who plans to do international travel to get this phone, instead of the carrier locked phones in the USA (no dual SIM available in the US)."
"To give a little back story about myself and phones, I'm that guy who has a new phone every few months. I don't break them, I just haven't been able to find something that I can get on board with for very long. This phone changes that.Pros:-Amazing battery life-Stellar performance from Samsung's exynos processor-Durable screen that is really hard to scratch or crack in general-Great rear camera with improved low-light performance over the S6-Rootable! *This is especially important to me or anyone that's really into android. This is why I no longer buy US variants of phones because carriers are making it more difficult to root and install custom ROM's-Really waterproof-SD expandabiltiy is back, as it should beCons--Edge is kinda annoying if you don't have a case. Your fingers will constantly press the sides of the screen and mess with what you are doing-No 64 or 128GB models for some reason. It's 2016 Samsung, only 32 GB?-Stock Samsung software is always atrocious in my opinion. This is why I use custom ROM's to get rid of most the pre-installed stuff-Lower camera resolution than the S6-Built in speaker sounds horrible after taking its first bath-Horrible to repairOverall, I do really like this phone still. I think I finally have found one that I will keep for some time now."
Great
"Clearly, the best cell I had so far"
The screen quality truly is fantastic and the camera is noticeably better than my family member's Iphones in tough lighting conditions. I had read the international version had a different graphics chip than US domestic. I don't know if its still true but I'm very satisfied.
Works great and looks even better. Got here very fast. Did have a little trouble when it was first opened trying to get it to English and not Chinese. Great choice from many different models.
just found out there is a recall on this phone. bought it as a present and have not opened it yet. trying to find out where to return
Its great and beautiful. FYI the origin seal region is Arab Emirates and it cannot use Samsung pay.
I received the item with Broken seal.
"An excellent phone in every way possible, feels very sturdy and premium when held in your hand."
Very sharp picture and display. The edge makes the picture looks 3D. The slippery glass face does not give me any problem about finger smudge as some people said on internet. However because the glass is slippery so you better get a protective cover not only to protect it but also prevent it from slipping out of your hand.
"Can't put a screen protector on it. Dropped it and it shattered. Now it is useless. Do not buy. I had the screen replaced, 1 month later, a pink vertical line appeared for a day, now the screen is black and won't do anything. DO NOT BUY!!!"
I got tons of compliments over this phone. They kept asking me where on earth and how did I got a pink phone. So far I'm loving it. Thank you
Love it!! No one has the coral so when I took it to AT&T to get my phone set up the were shocked I had it!! It's worth getting it syncs right up with my hearing aids just fine and with my car perfectly and it doesn't stay locked once it connects with your car so u are completely hands free!! Love the fact the rain will not ruin my phone since I work a lot outside!!
"Perfect, exactly as described and without any issues."
Very good
I was surprised that the unit could only either take 1 sim card and one memory card or two sim cards. Really have to read the fine print these days to know what you're getting. :/
It's so good
Excelente celular. El dual sim me funciona perfecto. Totalmente recomendable
Totally satisfied with this purchase
The phone didnt start .
"I purchased this phone to replace my malfunctioning HTC One M7. At first glance I have to say the screen is gorgeous. I have watched youtube videos and other short clips and was amazed at the crisp color and motion. When taking photos, the pictures were nice. When I zoomed in on the phone I did start to notice some minor pixelation so I will most likely stick to my Sony DSLR if I really what to take distant shots. I have a few games that I play and the controls are seamless and react with un-noticeable delays. I have used the fingerprint login for my phone and other apps but I cant get it to consistently work. Calls are clear and I like the volume boost option although it is disabled for my bluetooth headphones. The battery life is fair with the phone running for a full day with wifi, bluetooth, location and mobile data each being on. There is also a battery save mode that will cause the phone to become grayscale and limit which apps can be open while preserving messaging and calling. That is a huge battery boost. Overall, I am highly impressed with this product and I am hopeful that it will last for many year to come."
"I was thinking to buy the best smartphone out there but the touch screen is not very responsive, the touch screen randomly doesn't react without pressing the screen which make me feel that the phone is very laggy.It seems that it is a common issue.:("
"I dislike that I was deceived thinking that I was purchasing a ""NEW"" phone. Item used and repackaged To be sold as ""NEW""."
Just excellent
Had this for a few months now and can't be happier with it. A great phone.
phone worked as expected and was brand new. No complains happy with the purchase
Very satisfied ans so far so Great.
My phone is broken without drop and water.
I still want the same phone but the USA version of it! I discovered that i can't access so many things with this one in USA and the charger is also different from what we use here.I really need a quick assistance to get another one as replacement.thanks
All perfect
Shipped very fast. Box was sealed.. Only the English charger problem. Buy you can also find a converter for 2$.. Dual sim is working.. thanks.
Increíble!!!
It's good but after I bought then they have the recall for product.
Very Good!
Great looks and performance
By far the best phone I ever owned.
I like the product because it is new and came before the estimated date. I am well please with my order.
"Well the phone rocks, in many aspects are better then i expected but after 4 weeks CAREFUL use i found a scratch at the screen... Its tiny almost not visible actually i can only feel it not see it but its there and have no clue how in heck happened.I just ordered something actually hate it, a screen protector, it supposed S7's screen being scratch proof right? Well isn't :-("
Great Phone! Love it
great phone. cool that it can fit 2 sims. now don't need to worry about loosing sim cards.
"Hi, i bought a samsung galaxy s7 edge when i was in u.s, it is just 2 weeks old and it is really working good, but when i went home to the philippines it is always hanging and should be turn off (by long press of lower volume button and lock button) so i can use it again, at first my phone turns off and the light on top kept open i was scared so i searched for that way of turning it on again.. the second time and the rest it keeps on hanging so i needed to turn it off again that way so it will open again.. it happens to me more than 10x.. it is kinda annoying at the same time make me worried to because im too far from the origin country of the phone... is it normal to happen when you buy your phone from other country and use it here in the philippines? Or is it really the fact that it has something wrong with my phone? Thanks for response!"
The perfect phone.Make the iPhone 6 look and feel like something of the past
excelllent
Love this phone
I wish there was an outer box for these phone
Legit seller New Sealed Galaxy S7 Dual SIM as PromisedThank you
i received your device and was excellent thanks a lot
"Great phone, just as it was hyped/ reviewed by the many tech and phone experts out there. Would recommend it to anyone looking for the best overall phone out there right now."
Awesome. With russian language. 100% official. Love it!
Perfect phone. fast and beautiful
"The Best phone in market at this moment!7 reasons to buy it:1. Most beautiful design in the world2. SuperAMOLED display3. Camera is the best (12mpx, Opt.stab bla bla bla...)4. IP68 waterproof5. Wireless charge, quick charge6. Always on dislpay7. Memory 32Gb (DualSim/MicrSD up to 200Gb)"
"WTF This is should be an International Asia Version .I have a Verizon unlocked !!! Tell me why !!And the first page , shows that somebody has already set up the phone !look at the photos,please. the phone was Sold by: TechnoMaster"
"Good products, good service, excellent price."
"Good battery life, good camera, amazing features."
"Can't turn on/charge after 1 day normal usage. Tried force reboot/safe mode, nothing happened. Should be a FAULTY phone.DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER"
"The package was open, Late shipment,Bag was torn,The seal was broken.I'll return it.No star et all."
"No problems at all, great phone."
All fine
"I was Worried because of the reviews they give to this provider of all the missing phones or damaged phones.but let me tell you that when I received this phone it was ""obviously unsealed"" but in excellent Status no dead pixel, exactly how it was described, because of the International Version I got one from South arabia or some Asian country so it came with manual and charger from that country.But the Phone works perfectly running all the latest Updates."
Phone is amazingly fast but there is something wrong with the battery life. I only have an estimated 8 hours at 80% charged. Not even enough battery to last half a day. Will be submitting for return.
everything perfect
"I ordered Samsung galaxy S7 edge factory unlock international middle east version single Sim card, but I got the wrong order, it is samsung galaxy S7 7edge Duos/ dual Sim."
"I bought this phone in June 16 and it has been a dream. However 3 months down the road, it is bricked. I got a Bootloader Error and Samsung UK refuses to repair the phone even if I want to pay for it.The only solution is to bring it to Samsung Asia to get it fixed or alternatively, jailbreak it so as to reset the phone.Either way I am left with a phone I cannot use and no means to get any sort of refund or warranty"
The phone arrived early. Sealed. Good condition. Great phone and I'm happy with it.
"I like the the phone so far. Specially for the battery, the charged time is much shorter now. The phone is arriving on time. thanks"
"perfect condition, exactly as described, seal was not broken awesome phone!!"
Great!!!!
Arrived on time and and as expected.
"so far, phone has being working excellently."
Great product! I am rediscovering a true smartphone
Everything ok
Perfect Product
Works great and looks even better. Got here very fast. Did have a little trouble when it was first opened trying to get it to English and not Chinese. Great choice from many different models.
just found out there is a recall on this phone. bought it as a present and have not opened it yet. trying to find out where to return
"I was a bit dubious after reading a few of the negative reviews but found the phone which arrived to be in a sealed box and exactly as described on Amazon. I purchased from BREED and I am very happy with my new Samsung Galaxy S7 dual sim phone. The only downside was that it was a phone sourced from the United Arab Emirates which in itself is fine but the charger was for a UK type outlet, easily fixed with a US plug adapter."
great phone great service
FINE
All was excelent
Dood jop
"This phone is awesome never had a better phone battery life is absolutely amazing and don't worry this is NOT A FAKE I checked it and my box came brand new, new seal not broken like some people say but the only downside is it comes with a UK charger it's no big deal they include a U.S adapter with the package and my fast charging works just great so no need to go out and buy another charger just make sure u get a good case I have the speck candy shell I recommend it and I have no edge touch issues with a case on"
"I've had this for about 4 months now. I totally love how sleek it feels. Really premium piece of machine. But you need a good case, it feels that fragile. I've had a Samsung phone for over 4 years so using this was no difficult task. Nothing too surprising. There are things I don't use much though....such as the edge screen. Though the night clock really works well for me. It does seem to be waterproof but I will not willingly test that. But I notice I can still use the interface with droplets on the screen. This was not the case with my previous phone. It is still fairly new so the speed is great. Battery life is awesome. I can confidently leave home without the charger for an entire day of heavy use. No overheating. Overall, good purchase. I would buy it again but I have no intention of losing or destroying it and I don't plan on splurging on another upgrade for the next 2-3years. I hung onto my S4 for that long."
"Very good experience with this phone but it came with a cosmetic damage located at the back near the camera, looking like a small paint stain underneath the glass. Which doesn't really mather as it's in a case all the time."
We bought this S7 Edge to use it in Argentina (Movistar network) and it works perfectly well!
Excellent cell phone I am using two SIMs from México without problemsHighly recommended
"The seal arrived broken, the film protect was scratched and there was a dust between the display and film protection.The mobile is not a new one"
good
Unlocked for sure! Currently using it in Japan with a NTT Docomo chip. Tested the phone by playing music in the shower.
The phone didn't work
"I did quite a bit of research before buying a new smartphone. This phone is a bit pricey, but I decided to purchase it since it was one of the nicest phones that I seen. Also I knew that I would be taking good care of this device and would keep it for a while. I decided to purchase the international version that was unlocked so that I could select my GSM carrier. The phone was in excellent new condition with an adapter for US power supply. The phone is fast and I use the Wi-Fi router in my home for data usage to save on carrier costs. This is an excellent phone and I would highly recommend it."
"Product is good but easily Screen Cracked even was it in case and Samsung Service Center (in INDIA) is not able to replace screen(by paid service) as IEMI number is not visible in Theier system. Samsung Customer Support confirmed this will not be able to fixed in INDIA21-Aug-16: Increased One Start for Amazon , the customer support from Amazon is great and they are able me help."
What a great phone .I'm satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy phone...how could I put insurance on my phone
"I chose this model because it has two slots for nano sim, works perfect in Argentina , highly recommended ORIGINAL"
It a very nice phone
Love this phone. So fast and smooth. Lots of great features.
"Its a great phone, at first i was a little suspicious about this factory unlocked phone, but it turned out great!! dual SIM, easy to configure and overall great! its the best android phone out there so i highly recommended. it comes with everything listed and i checked the IMEI on the phone and the box and it matches. It does however come with the Europe charger but since i had the wireless charger from my S5 that wasnt an issue."
"It works very nicely, I had my concerns at first. And because of that it took me almost 3 months to decide on which option I should take."
It's nice
ok
what can i say??? greatest smartphone in market rigth now... cant complain on anything... it wonderful!
"After 5 month since I bought mobil phone, is gettting hot and have monitor problems"
Expected one Sims card received phone with two .What should I do now?
"Got this phone for 5 days, like it a lot. run smoothly, good looking, battery is good, as long as you know how to set your phone"
"This phone is giving me problems despite being two months in use! Unfortunately I experienced problems with it when the return date has elapsedFacebook App is not working, I tried to reload it so many times but in vainSometimes it switches its self offAnd the battery life is also not good"
"The phone was working just fine for a few months other then the battery draining extremely fast until recently. The s7 edge had a green line that went across the top of the screen and started flashing white while I was using the phone. It later progressed so that the screen would turn white and you whould no longer able to see what was happening on the display. Keep in mind that the phones screen is still in one piece and the touch sensors where still working.I called Samsung technical support and they said that they do not support the international model and for me to contact the country that it was made in, Vietnam. I then messaged Vietnam Technical support and they say they do not support products from the US.If I had known that by buying an international phone, I wouldn't have a warranty through Samsung, I would not have bought this phone, its a waste of money.Seller: Open Group Wireless"
AFTER A MONTH OF USAGE THE SCREEN HAS BLURY BLACK LINES WHEN I CHANGE THE LIGHT TO LOW.
"Not as described - it is not equipment with ""Dual-core 2.15 GHz Kryo & dual-core 1.6 GHz Kryo"" (Snapdragon 820). This is the international version that is using a different CPU."
Amazing phone as I'm sure your aware. Taking off a star for its only problem which is the edges can be very annoying when you are holding it and it registers a touch at the side. This is its biggest problem that many people complain about. Possibly a deal breaking issue I would probably go with the s7 tbh if I was buying again. In terms of the international thing it's no big deal exactly the same except it comes with a foreign plug and they include an adapter which is nice. Everything was in English and phone setup went flawlessly. The Asia version is dual sim compatible which is the only difference from the EU version as far as I can tell and find online. So go for that one. Keep in mind it will only work on GSM carriers such as tmobile and at&the and nothe with CDMA like Verizon
Very good
The edge is a terrible design unless you hold your phone in the palm of your hand and never touch the sides.
"I received a fake phone. It doesn't even have a spot for the Sim Card, neither does it charges or turns on. Some S7 details are literally drawn on the plastic. It's just a piece of plastic on a Galaxy S7 shape."
Just as specified....excellent
liked it
Great looks and performance
By far the best phone I ever owned.
Ok. Good. Noticias excellent.
The seller was good at communication . The only problem was tht the seal looked liked tampered but the seller assurred me that it was a new mobile and the seal was broken to unlock the mobile . And you get only 1 month warranty which is bad . Overall the product is ok and running good
"LCD damaged within 2 months, it either flickers a lot or there is a green line a few pixels thick in the curved display.I wish it has stopped working within first month, at least in that case I could have returned the phone.And I handled the phone with utmost care, and yes no water testing or anything of that sort."
Love the phone!! .. I use it with AT&T and works without any problems.
My son loved it
Item was delivered just as advertised! Working just fine with 2 sim cards in Brazil!
the phone was as it was described.great phone.
"I love my phone. The phone is working as I would expect a Samsung smartphone to work.The color is amazing (the picture does not do the phone any justice), the weight and size are just right and the folks from Mobiles International, LLC, did an excellent job describing it.I highly recommend this company and I will definitely buy from them again!"
"another sim or microsd, you can't use two sims and the sd card at the same time"
Just greater Just great
I started to see a bright pink line of the screen which wouldn't disappear. I have been maintaining the product with no impact. Shame!
Very Good phone
this is an amazing phone. best i have ever owned.
"Good buy.Months now.The retailer is too good and had a prompt follow up.The only one issue still haunting me is the charging time,it takes 2-3 hrs to charge from 0-50%.The retailer even send me a new charger free ,which didn't help me.i bought a wireless Samsung charger too ,but in vain.Otherwise the product runs smooth and fast.No hang,hiccups, by Gods grace still going smooth.Thanks for the retailer. All the best for him."
great product
"great camera, great battery life, best screen ive seen.great phone overall"
excelente
"I was immediately dissatisfied with my Galaxy S7 out of the box. The famous fast charger included is only for 'type G' outlets...the kind used in Malta, Cypress, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and parts of the UK with 3 plastic rectangular blades. It's useless to anyone in Europe or the US. And there is no US adapter included that will allow for fast charging. I'm using my old USB type c charger which takes about 4 hours for a full charge!!!Upon setup, I immediately realized that the wifi calling feature was disabled. After doing some research, I learned (from online android blogs, so keep the source in mind) that my phone is an Arab Emerites (UAE) version for which WiFi calling is unavailable, unlike other international versions sold in the UK and China. That will be a HUGE cost for me when traveling internationally.Finally, I'm only on my 3rd charge, but the battery life is nowhere near advertised. I had a 100% charge at 7:30am, and at 10am my battery is down to 66%. It will not go a whole day with moderate/heavy use. This is NOT the 2 day battery S7 sold in the USA....buyer beware."
"The screen broke and began showing stripes after a month (hardware defect). Possibly related, the battery also needs to be recharged 2-3 times a day with moderate usage (no video or downloads, background apps closed). Judging by the other reviews, this retailer is fine with selling faulty and fraudulent products. Do NOT buy from this retailer."
Awesome phone
Very good
Bought this phone from them and it started to malfunction after 31 days and they are not willing to do anything about the issue. Coupled with that is the fact that there is no one in the US able to fix the phone because it is a korean version and Samsung here wont accept the phone for repair due to the same reason. Stay far from this product is how i see it.
Perfect
The Phone itself is an absolute 5* Rating. However the Bloatware from the Korean 3rd party was not expected and although I was able to disable it (Olleh) it still continues to display the Logo at start-up.
Works perfect
I've been using the phone less than a month and already had to perform 2 forced system reboots due to system crash.
"Amazing,awesome. I recommend it completely"
"I was worried that it could be a fake but it's definitely the real deal. I guess I don't have to mention that it's super fast and and extremely good looking. I like the price , way cheaper than us version"
Excellent Product & Service
Everything was as showed
It's an amazing product.I am very happy with it.
Good deal. Delivered on time. Packaging was intact. Phone works great!
Outstanding smartphone. I have been using a IPhone 6s and a Galaxy S6 Edge before. This smartphone beats both.
"Just what I want, a perfect gift for my wife"
"Love it, it came with usb adaptor and 110v adaptor!got an European version wich is great for me"
Great phone! My first Samsung and plan to continue with this brand!
"As soon as i got this i have yet to put it down, SUPER FAST, AMAZING SCREEN, its the dream phone i have been waiting for. Easy to transfer my data to the new phone, very thing and light, when i first held it i was like ""omg this thing is super light"" like i would drop it forgetting about the weight of it lol Only thing i was ""eh"" on about getting it was the seal was detached from the box(wasn't broken but the adhesive was rubbed off from shipping/warehouse), and the branding that usually says ""S7 Edge"" on the back is not on this model which i think is a good thing but made me feel for about an hour ""man i got a fake"" but it was not the case at all, it felt like the real deal. I checked the settings and the software is super snappy and easy to use, in the ""about phone"" section of settings it does say model number and the phone type as what it was advertised.PRO:~Amazing screen~Great build~Wireless Charging/Water Resistant(i have tried the water resistance and i say it works, had residue from the stickers and so i ran under tap water and cleaned that right off)(i have yet to try wireless charging yet)NEUTRAL:~Battery(it seems great but at the same time not so great. I woke up at 7am with 100% and then by 8:45am its at 85% so i still great but i feel by the end of the night ill have 10% left or less. I am a heavy user when it comes to my phone)CON:~Charger it comes with is foreign(my seller gave me an adapter with my phone, but i don't know if that's every purchase so be well aware it MAY NOT come with an American Adapter)As far as i can tell that's about it so far, i will update my review when and if anything changes. Yet to test wireless charging but plan on picking one up soon and will add an edit to this."
"It is good phone, came on time. It is not fake. Everything was good but my messanger is not working properly."
The phones features are great. The only thing is that... I've had the phone for a week and not dropped it once. Today the phone cracked when I dropped it... I was sitting on the floor when it slipped from my hand less than a foot up and the entire screen cracked. This material that it's made from is terribly fragile.
Great!
Vera Good!
Goodd nice
"Bought this for my teen, he loves it!"
"I ordered this phone which was branded as an original but it was completely fake. Not only was the Samsung brand not on the back of the phone, but also the features of the phone event the writing was different from the original phone."
Everything great. Bought from wirelessplace.
Yes. sick lookin phone. I saw couple of feedback that says fake phone or something fishy. In my case it was all good. And about the phone it's great! Nothing much added to s7 accept hardware improvement. Touch unlock is much much better then s6 generation. Great bettary life something aspect from Samsung. Not dissopointed at all.
"Excellent phone. Everything arrived well to Venezuela, except the travel charger that does not work"
"I bought this right after my iPhone decided to stop working which was this past Saturday and I'm not disappointed. It's definitely bigger than the iPhone 6 so sometimes it feels like I can't hold it right..The battery life is amazing, great camera - Def different than a iPhone camera, great screen size and colorI have Cricket Wireless as my network and it's working great,BTW that company has the same signal as AT&T, but sometimes I have to resend texts several times, it's gotten annoying. Idk if that's a phone thing or provider issue?My last android was the galaxy S3 now to the S7 Edge, incredible improvement"
Excelent
One of the best phones out there.
I like the camera.
"DO NOT BUY! They will NOT SUPPORT YOU! DO NOT BUY! Purchased on June 10th 2016. 3 months later, the PHONE BRICKS. No damage, no spill, never even touched water, in a case its whole life. Just stops working, going on, nothing. Got extremely hot for about 2 hours for no reason after it went dead, but then nothing after that. Called Samsung (had registered the device and everything), first they collected info on the phone and said they will call back in 24 hours. Waited a week, no call. Called back and they straight up told me they will not help because Samsung America does not help Samsung Anywhere-else. They connected Amazon, and Amazon just dropped the phone on me in mid sentence with no call back! (And no number I can call them back). Return policy ends July 31st ONE MONTH+ after the order!!Basically if you buy this phone from here you will not be supported if anything goes wrong.... and my phone BRICKED with neither Samsung, Amazon or TheCoos stepping up to the plate to support or repair. I wonder why Apple has a loyal fanbase? *Dripping with Sarcasm*DO NOT BUY! They will NOT SUPPORT YOU! DO NOT BUY!"
Switched from an iPhone 5 and so glad I did. This is an amazing phone!
Good products
Excellent
Love it
The charger which was sent with the phone does not apply to the USA setting.it is really giving me a hard time to charge and I also expected the phone to come with a memory card but it does not have one.
Everything as should be... would buy from them again
nice phone very good
"Amazing phone. Bought it to use it in Argentina, 4G works perfectly. Packaging was inmaculate."
"Love Love Love this phone. The screen is crisper than anything I have seen, it's fast and beautiful. Life is good"
All excellent
excellent service and product
Great
It is a great original phone which registered in United Arab Emirates. That's why that cheap.
Excelent Phone
The phone is great the only thing is that I have a charger for Europe not for the US
It was everything that was expected 👍👍
"When Samsung removed the ability to add removable storage to their line of phones I quickly defected. A short stint was run with LG and Motorola/Lenovo and now, with the S7 Edge I'm happily back in Samsung's court.I've been using Samsung devices since before the Galaxy line and have had each device save for the badly thought out S6 and Note 5. The S7 Edge is superior to the former iterations and I am happy to say that not only is the hardware beyond average but the software has been updated to not only run smoothly but also detracts from the excessive bloatware and creates a much more pleasant overall user experience.The Edge feature, while still gimicky I feel, does have its uses but I feel that like the S-Pen on the Note line you will either use it extensively or not at all. In the end though this is a wonderful upgrade and a welcomed return to the ability of having 200GB in my phone in addition to the onboard storage option."
"wonderful and fast! for those whos out of US, I can advise. sent to Angola and works beautiful..."
phone started to flicker by itself green color and now is just black display.
Excelent product
Excelent smartphone
The speaker does not work. The headset is not heard for calls. Does not emit any sounds. Try updating firmware. Clean the terminal. But unfortunately it is the hard. Is a beautiful and expensive paperweight. It has no international guarantee. The phone is from the Saudi Arabia region.
"It was perfect for a month until just yesterday, it suddenly crashed while I was using it and will no longer properly boot up. Going to try calling Samsung for servicing tomorrow, hopefully the warranty works.**Edit update 11/19: Samsung said that their US warranty does not cover for international versions and fixing it myself did not work. Luckily, I called Amazon and they very kindly allowed me to return the phone for a full refund! If you are facing the same problem you might want to try this asap!"
Good value for the money
It's good so far
The rear glass is broken. The headphone does not work. I guess that's why it's cheap.
"Phone arrived OK it functioned fine. After one month problems started. Phone constantly reboots. Some times gets stuck, no hard reset is possible, only need to wait for battery to die. Next thing phone died altogether. There is no warranty from the shipper TheCoos !!!. Now I am stuck with this brick and do not know how to fix it. I did not expect such a poor performance from a supposedly top of the line phone. Maybe this ""International version"" is fishy. I strongly advise: Do not buy this phone!!!."
The product start to have problems with the screen and the vendor dosen't have any to say about that
"I like the S7 Edge a lot. Very sold phone, good battery life. Nice looks."
Works great! excelent product!
"Be careful , It comes with UK Plug ."
"Excellent screen, fast, good battery life, has met my expectations."
"Good seller, product as per description."
"First of all this phone did not have DUAL SIM, but that is the seller's fault for the bad description. However the screen quickly shattered even with a protector on and without even dropping it. Something just bumped my leg and it was done. Screen replacement is very high as well. not having airdrop and imessage really takes away ease of use."
"Perfect service, Quick delivery, Great product.Thanks!"
Cracked after 4 months. Great phone but very easy to break
"Phone was already opened when I received it. Factory seal was broken and a cheap white sticker stuck over it to make it look like it was sealed, but the original broken seal was still underneath. The protective cover had also been removed because it wasn't on straight and there were bubbles and lint under it. Factory unlocked means unlocked from the factory, there should have been no reason for anyone to have opened it to unlock it as it said it came that way from the factory. Good part was returning it to Amazon was very easy, though I had to wait several days to get the $ back on my credit card to be able to buy another phone."
IT stopped working after 1 day. Major disappointing
This phone stopped working after 3 months. It reboots the on its own and freezes constantly.
"*** FRAUD *** I ORDERED THIS FROM ""BEST PRICE MOBILE"" AND RECEIVED A DUMMY PHONE NO USB CABLE *** JUST A PLASTIC DUMMY PHONE GAMESTOP CHARGER AND ARAB MANUALS *** BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!!! *** FILED FRAUD COMPLAINT WITH AMAZON"
"I bought this phone in August for my wife, the phone has been a hassle from the get go. Two weeks after purchase the volume button started moving erratically on its own. Then the phone started hanging and will not reset by just switching off the phone, we need to hold the power button and the decrease volume button at the same time. The frequency of hanging just kept increasing, even after the doing a factory reset the phone continued to deteriorate. I am highly disappointed! I would have returned the phone if the window had not elapsed. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"
"Excelente Product!! No objections, just get a antislip case cause is like silk"
Its a bad experiencie because I Lost almost $120
Good item.
FRAUD!!!... Phone is from Brazil and does not work.
ok
ok
good every thing
"great deal, great seller!"
it is an excellent cellphone
perfect
so much better than getting the ATT version of the phone no bloat ware and you can teather with out having to buy the extra service from ATT
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CJU9BBM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
Legit Company. The phone is brand new no issues... & these guys are fast!!!
Great
I have it for a about a year and works great!
"Screen failed in under 4 months. No warranty, no repairs. You are paying for a future $600 brick."
Works with American AT&T no problems. The 4g lte symbol does not show up but I know I get the speeds. Very happy that I purchased it
"Love this phone so far. It has been reliable and works as advertised. This is the international version, which means certain apps, like Samsung Pay, don't work. It's only come up a couple of times, but it is annoying. Not a negative on the phone, it's clear that this is the case. Just wanted to spread awareness."
"do not buy a international phone some features will not work,,,,,,,,, This seller is slow on returns"
Great Phone !
"All issues regarding the Galaxy S7 edge were well received except for the app Samsung Pay. It doesn't seem to be available, tried to download and was presented with a Not compatible with this device warning. But for the most part, it meet all qualifications as advised."
"WOULDN,T TRADE IT FOR NOTHING ."
"I bought this cell some days ago and I couldn't be happier. This Latam version is working fine in Argentina. It's good to check before you buy if you cell works with in your country and carrier at [...] , very helpful...Thanks."
"The gadget works perfectly in Brazil, with VIVO 4G, but the battery life is poor."
Like
It's an excellent phone...
Very good
It stoped to work after 2 months. I am very disappoint.
"The features are OK, but it's not a great value. Not a huge step up from the Galaxy 6. If you have a Galaxy 6 edge and are looking to upgrade, hold off on this one. It's not groundbreaking stuff. More of the same."
Perfect
"I received the package open, the wall charger inside the package it was for U.K, I expected to receive the US connector. the phone recently it was completely dead I need to did a procedure to re start it. For these reasons I was no satisfied with my purchase."
The phone is working well but the chargers adapter can't be used in the US. I would like if the company can send me a charger to use to charge my phone.. Apart from that all is good about the phone. Does it have a warranty tho ? If it does how long?
I have 3 mons and no work more.
I am not able switch on my mobile since today morning. The last used yesterday night and when I woke up in morning I found my mobile was totally dead even not charging also.Kindly help me to find the solution.
"Works excellent on Cricket. No issues, this is a truly unlocked phone. Had purchased a so called unlocked phone from a retail store that calls it self the Best to Buy at. They even had displayed signs saying ""Free to choose"". Except after paying more then $800 I found out freedom came after paying another $300 over a 6 month period, to Ole Ma-Bell. Then they would provide me an unlock code for my ""unlocked"" phone.If you're looking for a unlocked that's really, buy it here."
I got this item yesterday.. But it looks great!!
It doesn't work .. and I send it back to Amazon and I am waiting to give my money back .
"The charger adapter was not in the box, I can not use the phone."
"I loved the phone. Firstly it works, there is no problem with the phone. It is fast and sharp. Screen is big and colorful. I love the curve part. With normal use (some social media, little talk, some music stream with bluetooth earphone it's battery goes for 2 days. If I play Pokemon, it goes 1.5 days"
"Good product, but a little defect. The home button make big noise when pressing it."
Thanks very good
Great product.... great seller
It said the phone was unlocked and I can't even use it with Verizon very upset
beautiful good
Perfecto

beautiful and fast
"This phone is the best and has no problem, it works perfectly in Ecuador."
I am a bit concerned about the battery I was expecting it to last longer than it does
"Phone is very sleek. it looks nice and it has a lot of things going for it.- Water Resistance- Amazing and Fast Camera- amazing screen- pretty fast charging- Good Battery- Fast Charging- Fingerprint Scannerand others.but for all of its pro's it has a few Big Faults. The big one for me was how hot the phone got. For just using google Maps, to even playing Pokemon go for a little bit in the park, the phone got so hot I could barely hold on to it. I couldn't even imagine using this with a case on it might melt. Then when the phone detects that it gets too hot then it makes that big beautiful display lowers it brightness to where I can not see in the daylight anymore. I am having a lot of issue with it in the Sun.I have heard of these issues with other Samsung phones. Maybe its just the ones with this certain processor, I am unsure if the SnapDragon ones have this issues but the reason I got the international is that it could go to any carrier more or less and I could get the added performance of the Exynos Processor. Turns out it was a bad idea and the phone got so unreasonably hot that I could barely hold on to it. The phone also got noticeably slower as it got hotter. Probably because the processor was limiting itself.Maybe this could be fixed with a software update but I think this is more of a hardware issue. Maybe I just got unlucky and got a defective phone as i don't see many other people mentioning these problems. I do not blame Samsung or have any bad feelings for them. I just got unlucky with my device and will be returning it to Amazon."
"5 stars to the phone, 0 stars to ATT. ATT was not able to get 4G connection going on this phone. Blamed hardware. IMEI checked good. Phone would show 4G AP but could not establish data connection with it. Was only working with 3G AP at 3G speed.The thing that did the trick was temporarily inserting SIM card from friend's phone that was connecting 4G. My phone made 4G connection right away. Means hardware is good. Put back my own SIM card. Voila, phone still connects at 4G!"
"nice product, easy to use, but both front and back crack very easily."
Everything perfect
Great product! Got the Italian version. Doesn't seem to be any different. Good battery life.
"Works perfect with the Brazilians (GSM) carriers. Nice and solid finishing. Noticeable improvement from version S6 (I have one). I wish it was for two SIMs, but's ok."
"EDIT: So after owning this for a few months, I'm dropping the rating solely because of the Edge touch screen. The fact is that I find it very annoying to use. The side of your hand touches it really easily, and it it makes typing or playing games on the phone very frustrating. The edge apps themselves are very few and far between and not that useful either. It's a pity since the phone itself is great, runs programs well, has great visuals and camera but actually using the thing is just frustrating. I'd suggest getting just the S7 to save yourself some money and comfort.The phone that arrived is the genuine article and works great--I'm thrilled with how well the battery and fast charging works even when playing Pokemon Go all the time. Also, I have T-Mobile and the phone works perfectly fine.However, even though the app is on your phone, the international model is not compatible with Samsung Pay. If you want that you need to get the American version of the phone. I wish I'd known this, but to me it was worth the savings in price and you can still use Android Pay. But I didn't realize this before buying it and I would have liked to have known."
"After a few hours of use,unexpectly turned off,then it begins lagging and acting weird,just talk to amazon for help, they didn't help me because it was bought through a freight forwarder.i really feel like a wasted my savings for nothing"
The cellphone is not unlocked like the wibsite describes. The cwllphone is locked by T-Mobile carrier
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
"Beautiful cell phone, light weight, thin, good screen size, lots of functions. As soon I inserted the SIM card it gat connected to my provider. Its working fine"
"International phones can not be repaired in the US. Despite the cost of this phone, it is a piece of crap. Samsung customer support will not help. LCD problem in less than 3 months with minimal use, and NO damage. Not even a scratch on the phone, yet it is almost useless. There are smart phones selling for $10.00. This one cost me $850.00 and did not last long. BUYER BEWARE."
"Excellent! Great design, smart, camera is wonderful even in the night time with bad light. Sensitive screen, fast internet... no problem. Thank you.Delivery in time."
ok
thanks very good
Perfect!!
All that I expected
"I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 and am absolutely Amazed by this phone. It can go for over two days before charging. It has none of the typical bloatware. It's supposedly waterproof but I don't plan on testing that on purpose. It's painful to have to pay the full price up front but it's worth it to not be at the mercy of your cell phone provider. I will never buy a locked cell phone from a cell phone provider again. I'm glad they brought back the SD memory slot, but I wish it had a removable battery. Other than that, I think the Galaxy S7 is one of the best phones on the market at this time."
"Excellent phone, I just wish it had all the band's of the phones so you can switch to any carrier like the nexus phones, and Samsung pay wish it had but I know because it's international it couldn't, but we'll made. :)"
Have had the phone for a month and just love it.
too much advertisement and getting hot too past.
Perfect
I hope this one can use a long time.....
"Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G935F- Black OynxAbsolutely disappointing, the charging port was hurt at 4 days, and today after 10 days has begun to smoke and smell of burning. I'll have to repair the ""new"" cell. I'm angry and I'll never buy in this shop."
"It is perfect this phone . First time that I bought a phone online and I had a very good experience . It's in very good condition and I got the phone next day . The only thing it's that on the back doesn't say ""galaxy s7 edge"""
"Bought this phone and have had it for several weeks. Absolutely love it ! fast and smooth, battery life is amazing. I'm with AT&T and if you can sacrifice wifi calling... this is the way to go. although it doesn't have all the LTE bands I have absolutely no trouble. My job requires me to travel often and I get great coverage everywhere, even in the gulf of mexico. I am now an exynos s7 edge fan boy."
Excelente Producto. Vendedor Recomendable
"if u have tmobile by this with confidence I was very hesitant at first people saying this is designed for a different region, until i remembered that I am middle eastern and the phone I previously bought was designed for middle east and worked great here in the US until I decided to upgrade, the only difference you will notice is the pre installed apps for the region and that chargers may have different inputs because it was designed for Europe or middle east, my seller that i bought from solved the charger issue by providing a complementary connectorgo for it, be brave for once."
"Everything went well, excelent product. Hope do not explode!"
i love my galaxy s7 i have no words
"excellent product, highly recommendedClosed box wine"
Samsung> Iphone
Love Samsung phone and tablets
This phone is really fast and there is no lag for multitasking.
It is working fine just like the seller descrived
This phone is absolutely amazing. Everyday I learn something new about it. Amazing
I was nervous about purchasing an international version of this phone but I'm happy I did. I actually owned a US AT&T version prior to this model and I can confirm the following after several days of use and testing:1) The International version has the faster Exynos 8890 vs Snapdragon 820.2) Battery life appears to be better than the Snapdragon 820 US model.3) No problems with AT&T LTE 4G.4) No AT&T bloatware!So far I highly recommend it!

"I live in the UK, but had this delivered to a friend's address while I completed a road trip from Miami to San Francisco. The delivered product was well packaged and was originally intended for the Middle East market. A big bonus for me is that the supplied charger uses a UK-style 3-pin plug. While hardly a big deal as I, like most people, have the world's supply of USB power adapters. Considering that this purchase has saved me quite a bit of cash over outright purchase in the UK, I'm very happy.Powering up the phone for the first time shows a single application for the intended market which was deleted as I have no use for it. I've owned Android phones previously, but have been using an iPhone 6 Plus for the last year. I've since fallen out of love with iOS as it's just too inflexible and is becoming somewhat childish in terms of interface. Samsung's implementation of the Android platform is smooth, highly-polished and commendable. It's not as fast as the pure product in the Nexus lineup, but does not suffer as all as a result.The octacore processor in the non-US model is just pure sweeping power. It's a good thing that the battery is a hefty 3500mAh unit or it wouldn't last the day. That said, if you're the kind of user who has multiple applications running all day long - and I'm among that userbase - this phone will take it all in its stride and not break a sweat. The screen is absolutely beautiful without being too highly saturated, the cameras (both front and back) are immensely capable and the return of expandable storage through cheap and capacious micro-SD cards is very welcome.Physically, the phone is svelte, lightweight and sits in the hand beautifully. Even without a case, there's no feeling that you'll drop it at any moment. One of the finest physical features is the waterproofing that doesn't require that you slap chunks of rubber into the ports to maintain its integrity. no more panics when you're caught in that torrential downpour about your phone suffering a premature demise.I haven't tried any of the included accessories such as the micro-USB cable, charger or earbuds as I already have very high quality 3rd-party versions. From the look of them, they appear to be reasonable quality.For anyone in the US who's concerned about losing out on network connectivity by using a phone from an overseas market, rest assured. I used a SIM card linked to T-Mobile's 4G network and had absolutely no issue anywhere with obtaining a good strong 4G signal. The Exynos processor in the US market model, while likely perfectly adequate, will almost certainly be that touch slower than the beast in the overseas market product.If you're like me, fear running out of power when you're away out all day and carry a power bank, know that the quick charge 2 feature has this from about 5% to fully charged in around an hour. The genuine Samsung quick charge puck may be slower to re-add the juice, but it's utterly convenient when you're a tired and then don't have to worry about not quite plugging the phone in to charge.If you're seeking to buy a phone without the burden of a contract, do yourself a big favour: Save some money, get this model, use one of the probably five or six wall chargers you already have and enjoy this incredible handset. It may be coming from outside of the US, but it's delivered quickly and I have no doubt whatsoever that it'll be loved every bit as I love mine. This is the best phone I've ever had, and the added bonus of saving on the cost of purchasing outright through Best Buy, etc is the icing on an already very delicious cake."
Got horizontal lines on display within few days of usage. Unable to return it because the timeline to return has expired :(
perfect
excellent
"The phone is amazing! the screen is simply the best on the market right now. I read different comments about unreliable sellers selling fake or refurbished phones. I was lucky I bought mine from seller, theCoos. Got the phone new as described without problem."
"AWESOME phone. Came prepackaged, sealed, Turned on in English. There was an Arabic file of some sort - which I deleted. The model number matches correctly. No issues or problems getting it going and activated. Took it to my local AT&T store for the sim card and it took a little extra time and a couple of restarts, but after that everything is working great. I'm still learning some of the little tricks that come with it. The cell coverage shows ""4G"", not ""4GLTE"". I don't know the difference. The ATT guy said some would say it was better, LOL. I have no idea but, whatever. There are a few pre-installed samsung/google things. Smart Switch uploaded many things, but some things like ringtones were not backed up. I had to go looking for them. In the process, I also discovered some new ones. Battery is doing just fine and lasts as expected. It has it's own Samsung factory warranty - 1 year. I haven't been able to find any way to tell for sure if this is the snapdragon or xynos processor, but as I stated earlier, the model number matches, so....my first experience with an unlocked phone purchase on Amazon has gone well, IMHO. Thus far."
"The Samsung Galaxy S7 is perhaps the best mobile device right now. With so much technology, it has boosted the Galaxy S series. It is very easy to use and it makes you feel as if you don't have a mobile, instead you have so much more."
do not have samsung pay for international version. which is the main reason why I select samsung.
Device works fine and is fully unlocked and shipped in two days. All around good service
I'm kind of afraid that I wasted my money buying this considering all of the negative reviewsi just read. I surely hope that it works out when I receive it
The unit tells me IT IS NOT registered On NETWORK and does not allow me to make calls.
"This phone is AMAZING. The display is gorgeous, it takes some time to get used but it totally worth it. This phone works great in argentina's network and i am having a pretty rough time trying to kill the battery it just doesn't want to give up."
all ok
Powerful tool!
Exelent Phone!
Great phone
Thanks amazing
"the phones is a very nice one , works great ..."

Why does this phone have different features than my friends like this one say about device and my friends says about phone and MA you more stuff too but why
Amazing and beautiful!
"Best phone available today. Stunning 4K display, amazing camera and water proof....whaaaaatttttttt. Awesome."
Best phone ever! Happy and satisfied!
really nice phone
Great
"I purchased this S7 edge back in March. After two months, it started showing some screen color issues with annoying purple stripes all over the screen and the cellphone itself feels hot. I had to set the brightness to the maximum to temporarily ""avoid"" screen issues. And what's worse, the screen just died completely and I can't even turn off this phone since the screen is no longer functioning. Now I am trying to return this failed S7 edge and get my money back and never gonna buy any Samsung product again."
"excellent product, very good quality, I recommend"
exccelent product
"incredible, very satisfied and recommended"
Seal appeared to be broken when I first opened the package. Phone is the best I have ever experienced so far. Be careful with these international phones if you are a US buyer.
I am still in love with my samsung galaxy s7 edge a month later. I hope nothing will change.
This cell work perfect good.
Amazing unlocked phone! Currently using it in Mexico with a prepaid ATT Sim card and everything is great! Very high quality photos in front and in the back of the phone. The metal finish is very high quality! Love it!
"I got the exynos version. The phone works great. The phone is fast in switching between app and windows. The edge panel can be very useful if u arrange it to your need.Two best thing: the screen is wonderful - vivid colors very high brightness, one of the best screen by far; the battery - so powerful, i can use my phone for all day and the battery will not dead.Overall i am very-very satisfied with my s7 edge."
"Phone works well for two months. Then the display turned off. I tryed to get support from Samsung, and they said is an International version, it has not warranty in the US. Needs to be sent to Australia for warranty service. Very ugly experience"
All ok
Unrepairable in USA
ExcellentI bought it for a friend he got it today and is very very happy with his gift
Very nice product.
"so far is amazing, fast, awesome screen. I haven't try the unlocked since I need new Sim card, now it uses the nano simple card, but I'm expecting to work."
"I'm a bit disappointed with my shipment. Only got European socket charger but no american charger or adapter like people say they got on other reviews. Also seal of packaging was already broken! And also packaging was kind of workn. Still phone looks great, bummer I will have to get a proper charger before using it! To nake things worse now phone is almost 10 dollars cheaper than when I bought few days ago."
great value product!
Awesome phone. Would recommend it highly
This phone works perfectly thus far.. I'm loving it!!
Delivery came on time. Definitely pleased with my new phone!
Nice
Got it on time and everything was perfect. The charger was european so it came with an adapter. Works perfect.
Awsome!
Great item still testing durability and exploring features.
every new phone has firsttime open setting.but it already opened and has 7% power left when I got it .even when I Check the background.there has some apps .one of them is setting.I use to worked in a store(someone like bestbuy) in china.i was the manager of 3C(cell phone .camera )department.so I know what we did to the returned phones.but to renew a phone.at least clear the data and make sure no one will know.please do things professional.
"Awesome phone, great build quality, very slim, i had a samsung galaxy S3 before, and that phone last like 8 months, hate it samsung for their build quality, since then i've been trying another brands, so i decided to give samsung another try and guess what i love this phone, my only complain is the battery it doesn't last long like the iphone 6s plus, it has one of the best AMOLED screen i have ever seen the color are very bright and clear so if you want a phone buy this one you'll not regret it."
"Really is an amazing phone well worth the upgrade,"
The phone is really good
"It is slippery. But i mean really really slippery. It is so slippery that it can be used to grease a pan. I heard that in the dictionary they added a picture of the Samsung S7 in the word slippery definition. It is THE MOST slippery thing i have ever seen in my entire life. You couldn't hold it with your hands even if you had frog fingers, because it is so slippery. If you don't mind a slippery phone, go ahead, but i must warn you.. it is very slippery. Very very slippery.(Ps. I tried to add a photo of something very slippery so you can relate but couldn't find, cause all i can think of a slippery thing is Samsung S7)"
Exactly as promised. Was worried I wouldn't be able to activate it with an American carrier (since the included documentation indicated that might be a problem as opposed to requiring a European carrier to activate it first) but it worked fine.
Why the phone doesnt say galaxy s7 edge on the back ?
I love it.... it works get on metro pcs. I live in NYC. No complaints
"I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935F in Black from this product page a week ago.A lot of people have asked questions about this particular international version so I'll answer some of those first. For starters, the one I got was the english edition for the Saudi Arabia market (see attached photos, the guides came in english and arabic). From what I can tell, the phone is the same as any other international edition but with different preinstalled apps. Mine came with a SA region specific app ""Shaid"" (seems to be a YouTube-esque app in arabic) that I uninstalled and WhatsApp. Other than that the only remaining bloatware was stock Samsung apps (no carrier apps, thank god), the only other thing I noticed that may be region specific is the S Planner app has a ""Hijri dates adjustment"" setting. Lastly this version ships with a non-us wall charger (aside from the regular stock accessories) shown in my review images. Mine also came with an adapter for use within the U.S., I have tried it and can confirm that it works with fast charging.This phone also uses a different chipset (manufactured by Samsung, called Exynos 8890) than the U.S. version. Reviews I read noted that the phone was actually optimized for this chipset w/ better performance and battery life than the U.S. Qualcomm counterpart (Google it). In the U.S. version the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip is used to support Verizon and Sprint customers whereas this version only supports GSM carriers.To preface the review of the actual use of the phone, I have owned the following devices and used them each as a daily driver for at least a months time: Samsung Galaxy S4 GPE, Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, HTC One M8 GPE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P. The Galaxy S7 Edge has been the most delightful experience of the bunch. I won't go into great detail here but the camera is phenomenal and launches faster than any other phone I've owned w/ a double tap of the home button. The camera's auto focus is super fast and I feel like I'm able to get a capture a lot of moments that my previous phones were too slow to shoot. It's also nice to be able to change the quick launch apps on the lock screen, I have the dialer and snapchat as mine.Continuing a theme of high performance this phone is incredibly fast despite powering a QHD resolution screen. Apps are surprisingly quick to load and multitasking is a breeze (I even found some use in the Samsung's split screen feature). The fingerprint scanner is on par with apple devices (and nexus 6p/5x) although because of it's non-circular shape I find that I place my finger the wrong way more often. The battery is the best of any device I've used as a daily driver, I've been able to get through days of heavy usage like today (unplugged from charger at 5:45am, now at 25% at 9:03pm).The screen is BEAUTIFUL. Not only is it easy to read even in direct sunlight (something I have seen other devices struggle with) but the colors are vibrant and the screen is huge without making the phone too big or bulky. Perfect for watching YouTube videos and browsing instagram.Lastly a few notes if you buy this phone:- If you're not a fan of the stock Samsung launcher you can get the Google Now launcher from the Play Store, it's the same one used on Nexus devices and feels smoother than Samsung's launcher.- This time around Samsung decided to give you bigger icons which drove me nuts, search for ""Get more on your Galaxy S7, S6 or Note 5 screen with hidden DPI scaling settings"" from Android authority to get a 5th column on the home screen and smaller UI elements.- ""Edge functionality"" is just okay. The feature feels a bit less than polished because of the weak offerings in the Samsung app store - I have it turned off.Edit 4/8/2016: sorry about the quality of the photos of the actual phone - they were shot with the wide angle lens of my GoPro whereas the other images were shot with the S7 Edge.Edit 4/10/2016: added some higher quality images from my new camera.Update 5/9/2016: I've been using the phone as a daily driver for over a month now. I'm still impressed by the overall gfx smoothness, how fast apps load, and camera performance.Update 7/25/2016: still in love with this phone. I'm honestly not sure what would compel me to purchase a new phone at this point.. I also rooted the phone and changed the emojis to the iOS 9 set with the Emoji Switcher app from the play store. No more guessing when messaging my iOS friends =)A lot of commenters have asked which seller I purchased mine from: Wireless Everything."
Great phone. Got it today and it's absolutely beautiful. Can't wait to give it to my boyfriend as a birthday present he will love it. So far IL very please and I'm sure I won't regret the purchase!
You must buy this phone!!!! Much better than iPhone!!!!
Very good item and fast shipping
"Although my shipping experience was a bit troublesome, the product itself its amazing! I knew it was international version but was not expecting a UK plug, best part is I get almost not bloatware"
"awesome phone, excellent camera, i bought 3 of these phones"
This is literally my first review because I never had a product that deserved my time...until I got this phone! It's absolutely the most amazing phone I have ever seen!Couldn't be happier!
This is the best phone I've ever had
Perfect
good
A great phone with a lot of apps that can apply for fun or work. High speed and great connection.
This phone came newest. And many people asked where i bought it?. I most say what i see. Thanks again.
"Arrived on time and in perfect condition works perfect and very fast loading file and surfing,one of the best phones I have brought and will recommend to everyone"

"Stunning display. Impressive 5.5 quad -HD screen shows crisp colors from various angles. Best screen on any smart phone.Beautiful curved design is an eye-candy.Camera is not 12 megapixels and superior to S6 and iPhone. Auto-focus is also has great speed leaving others in dust.Large 3600mAh battery is like having a phone + battery case without actually having the thick battery case. Hard to kill that battery in a day.Always on mode constantly displays notifications without the need to unlock the phone.Water resistant. IP68 rated which means the phone can be totally submerged in water up to 1mt deep and 30 minutes.Micro SD expandable memoryAgain, the battery is so good."
"I have just one word for this phone: AMAZING!! Much better than Iphone, in my opinion."
Excelente!!!!
Great phone! Great Seller!
This is an Arabic/arab version . The retail box came opened. Not sure if it is new.
Very nice device. I would recommend it
Very very very disappointed I haven't had this phone for 3 months and gray bars appeared across the screen. I did my research and apparently it's a defective product no help from the seller because it's the international version. Definitely will not be purchasing from this seller again
When i got the ph9ne it looks like it is properly taken good care while waiting for people to buy it .the box has several dents and looks lile this is particular phone i have is stocked for a few months wire looks old phone shipped with 4% battery and idk whats wrong but pls tell me if u kno whats wrong . The AOD is not mov8ng anymore and yhe locl and unlocked sound dosent sound like the original samsung un/lock sound at all!!!!
Excellent... Love this phone.Fast shipping and looks like a good seller😃
"This was my first phone purchased online so I was a bit skeptical. However, I am very pleased with the phone. I am currently using it from the Caribbean and the setup up was as easy as inserting the sim card. I did all the necessary checks to ensure that the phone was indeed an original and it was. I purchased my phone from the seller ""wireless everything"" and was and still am immensely satisfied with my purchase."
Muy buen producto
"New Phone! Thanks, everithings is good!"
"product failed, it does not work"
Perfect phone except for the fact I cannot connect to 4GLTE in Texas on AT&T. I may try out TMobile and see if that network will connect @ 4GLTE. Anyone with suggestions on how to connect to AT&T 4GLTE please let me know. I have used the APN settings from AT&T website to no avail. I would give it 5 stars if not for the LTE issue. It will connect as 4G only NOT 4GLTE (San Antonio Texas)
"this model doesn't support samsung pay!!before you buy, you should know it!!"
I sm really happy with the product and the service provided
"The delivery of the phone was before time and the phone works flawlessly.. Do not worry about anything, you will never regret buying this device"
"I bought the S7 Edge and received it a few weeks ago. It is an excellent phone, however, it did freeze and had to be replaced. There are software flaws in the S7. Wireless Everything provided prompt service and I would definitely buy from them again."
It did meet my expection and I am so sati
product is as expected! had to return and the return pricess was also smooth
Decent phone no problems but at that price a warranty would of gave it 5 stars
"Be wary of the Edge phones. My husband dropped his from about 1 foot and the screen shattered. I have heard about this happening with other Samsung Edge products, but I have had so many phones and not once have the screens cracked so I thought I would be fine. I was wrong. I should have listened to others."
same as the one I would have gotten from AT&T except unlocked. The only difference is that samsung pay won't work yet.
Great product won't regret buying.
good excelent.
Amazing one
"Sooo ummm I got it the next day after ordering it, which is crazy. I done my personal testing and I'm really Impressed makes my note 1 feel like a brick.... edited part: I dropped it in a huge puddle today sat for a good 7 mins under water, pulled it out and still works great"
Excellent
good
"Came in perfectly fine, works fine. Is sexy. Yes."
Love the phone I was a little scare at first because some of the paper instructions were in arabic but I put the phone to work without trouble manage to change the settings to english and spanish .It is a great phone charge really fast the adapter came for middle east kind of current but they were kind and send a travel adapter for it works great so far I am really happy thank you.
The phone was working pretty awesome then it just crashed and wouldn't turn on. Did all the troubleshooting I could and it still wouldn't turn on. So I had to return item.
"Excellent product, it cover al my expectations and more. The seller has a great attention."
"Great camera, decent battery life, waterproof!"
I got the phone and it was on and were fingerprinted is this normal? or not?
Blazing fast and beautiful phone. Excellent camera
i can not use samsung pay and video calling facility in it.
Nice
It is working perfectly. I love it
very great phone i was abit worried when i ordered this but after recieving it using it i love it allot just some buyers know that with some carriers when u goto activate ur signal may just say 4g or lte or 4glte depends on where u r and ur carrier as for mine i have at&t usa and my signal says 4g i was hoping it would say 4glte maybe over time it will i dunno
good
Best cell phone ever. *****
"It's an awesome phone. The edge takes a little getting used to, but that's a small issue. Great camera, awesome sound in music and talking. Love the anti-glare. Seriously no glare from any angle. Even the headphones were great. Clear, crisp sounds. I bought the unlocked version and it works perfectly. Just had to insert the sim card and that was it. (And that's in the Caribbean) so for those customers wandering, it's definitely an Unlocked International Version. Highly recommended."
Nice phone
"Mejor, IMPOSIBLE!"
Phone came nice and all but won't hold charge. I need to charge it twice or sometime 3 times a day. I am thinking about doing a reset and see where it will lead me. But now I am away from home and won't be back for 2 to 3 weeks in other to exchange it. Grrrr I hate this
I purchased this phone from world wide distributors early last month and I have had the phone for just little over a month and it is defective!!!! My screen keeps blanking out and there are lines which are running through the screen which proofs that the phone had some underlying screen issues prior to being purchased by me. As you can see from the picture you can swe the lines which for under the screen and each time I try to complete an action the screen is forever blanking out and having lines. I am requesting an immediate of my money as this has been a waste. Do not buy
"Love this phone, great battery life and it's silky smooth UI."
"I bought it six months ago. Now it has overheating problems and the screen is flickering. Without warranty service, buy this phone is a waste of money."
"Perfect!!, just as adviced"
it made for middle east so there is Muslim holidays in calendar and other apps installed
Excelent product.. love it.
Was completely understand impression it would work on US Verizon. It did not.
Great
"Although this phone was advertised as being unlocked, it would not connect to the AT&T network when we took it to get it activated. The AT&T employee told us that it was not unlocked or it would connect immediately. He even restarted it to double check. The Amazon representative who started the returns process gave us the name and phone number of the company that actually sold it. When we called that number, a Verizon automated service answered the phone. So my conclusion is that the phone must be locked to Verizon. My 15 year old son worked all summer and saved his money to buy this brand new phone on his own and took great pride in that fact. He is so disappointed."
Love it...100% original samsung edge7
Excelente!!!!!
Had the phone for 4 months. Suddenly no data. Contact seller and was told no warranty as its a unlocked phone. Load of crap
The Samsung Galaxy s7 edge is a great phone. It was easy to transfer my info from my old phone to the new one. Love the low-light camera. I'm really happy with my new phone.
Excelent Product is the best
Argentina ok!!! 😉
tons of bells and whistles.... very obnoxious if you have nerve damaged hands (screen and features constantly activating without consent!!)... several totally useless things you cant turn off or get rid of without rooting the phone.... as this product arrives with no US warranty.. you aren't voiding anything... that at least is a bonus! Several features arbitrarily reactivate despite having turned off etc....Samsung could have done a much better job with this model.
"Very fragile, broke to the first fall. No warranty."
"Beautiful phone, features are awesome! Still discovering something new about this phone daily. The camera quality is the best I've seen yet.It's very difficult getting a screen protector that fits , bought 2 and they didn't fit the edges (although it stated that it was designed for S7 edge!!!) Still trying to get one that fits.Very expensive phone though 🙁!!! But I am really enjoying it..."
"Great phone , just as advertising, delivery on time , everything was A+"
The phone is Great.I did not understand though why Samsung chose not to support hebrew as an OS language in their international software.Had to pay money at Samsung Israel to install the hebrew supporting software.
Great product.
It's a good one
Excellent performance. A superb phone
This phone is way too fragile. It fell from less than a foot and was totaled. The edge design must make the glass thin and fragile. I’m seeing people complain about the phone breaking without even being dropped.My other phones were never in a case and took many falls from 3-4 feet and only incurred scuffs. I dread the day my replacement breaks because I know it’s going to happen; it’s way too fragile.
Ok
excellent phone
Nice phone i like it
"Samsung has made an absolutely Spectacular Phone with the Galaxy S7 Edge. Perfect Size; fits and feels well in the hand. Easy to use, the touch screen is brilliant, easy to see even outdoors, clear and crisp and the special edge feature of the screen makes this the most beautiful cell phone ever made. And that is just the beginning.The Camera in the New Galaxy S7 rivals many of the cameras you can buy for hundreds and hundreds of dollars! You can take Incredible photos in low light, great videos, even HD Video recording and much more. Removable Storage has come back with the Galaxy S7 and now you can insert micro SD cards with as much as 200GB of storage.You pay for high quality and the Galaxy 7 isn't cheap. But it is well worth it. BUY The New Galaxy S7 - you won't be disappointed."
"I'm very happy with this phone, fast hasn't fail and I had it for a week, I will update if things change but overall it's a winner"
"I already did wrote a awesome review for this phone, I even inspired myself like I was writing a poem and I gave 4 star to the phone but after 1 month and some days of use it started giving me problems, the phone restarts randomly out of nowhere, that has happened like 5 times and the then today I was just playing music and the lockscreen didn't work and the whole screen went black and none of the buttons were working to turn on the screen so I had it to do a massive restart, good thing it didn't erased all my stuff. I don't know if it has warranty or not but I'll be happy if I get my $850 back that I worked so hard."
Good job! I found my item on time!!
"Hi guys, I am using my new Galaxy S7 Edge about 1 1/2 month, and your charger stop working, this device have some kind of warranty? i am currently living in Ecuador.Regards."
I love my phone. Good condition. Beautiful. And not too expensive for this item. Thank you.
Good product.
Love my new phone
"Excellent Smartphone. Great Camera, Awesome for multimedia."
"Incompatible with AT&T, no 4G reception"
Solid phone
Received product excellent phone.
This phone is manufactured for Asia market so if you live outside Asia you will not have it fixed by Samsung in you country!
very good
Exelente
Best phone I've ever owned!
got the phone works great
Shipped very fast.Great phone.The only thing i'm not satisfied is my unit have that so called front facing camera out of focus. I wonder if I can ask for a replacement for this and how long is the return/replacement window for this item. It would be very nice if this can be addressed. Thank you.
Love it!
Wow I love this phone and it was shipped the the very next day I ordered it.
My best phone ever.
amazing
Like it
"First of all, this product came delayed in shipping. One week late to be exact.Second, the cable charger usb that comes with the product is missing a line, slowing down my charging. Another small issue is that the charger plug is big and doesn't fit in most power extension cords.There is also a small heating problem with the phone when using it to play games or for long periods of time.For my personal preferences, I dislike the phone because all the buttons are very sensitive; even the power and volume buttons are sensitive and easy to press on."
Samsung android phone is the best way to go. So glad they put the mini-sd storage back in.
"Amazing phone, totally better than the s7 normal. The edge rocks and is si much better in every aspect!!!"
Perfect!
Phone is amazing !
Cracked screen when opened...
Love it!!!
Perfect Phone. Recommend
pretty dopestill too much cash to drop on a phone without a removable battery.
"I like it, I love it"
"Amazing phone, don't know what to tell, one of the best in the world right now. The selller is very good, I ordered 2 of this.. and they are awesome..I tried it in water, battery is amazing. I am glad that I bought this one.. Thanks :)"
"Excellent Phone, astonishing camera and amazing performance."
Perfect
Ok
Great purchase.
"S7 Edge from United Arab Emirates (its what the phone detials say in the settings). Was brand new and unopened. Works perfectly. Setting it up was as easy as popping a nano sim card in. Was worried something might be faulty but the processor is snappy, screen is perfect as is the camera. No faults what so ever. Ordered Sept. 28 and arrived Oct 1st. I would highly recommend as there is no bloatware and it has a faster processor than US version. Have not tested the waterproof feature to give feedback on that.Seller: Wireless Everything"
"Best phone on the market, it is so amazing!!!! I love every little detail about this phone, IP68 water proof, absolutely amazing screen perfect size phone feels very amazing in hand alot better than iPhone, iPhone is slippery in hand compared to the beast of a phone, I love it!"
"Excellent phone, I have no complaints with it so far. However, this is the first Samsung phone that I have ever managed to crack the screen on. I have always used my phones without a case, and never had a screen crack until this one."
"Best phone I've ever had. I've owned iPhone, Sony, Nokia, but, this, is the best in any sense."
"Product came sealed unopened and is indeed a geniune s7 edge, very happy with the phone and shipping was fast as well."
Very nice cell phone. Although it is international model but still it is very good. Came with europe's charger but is very good phone. It had nice packaging on the product.
Soon after purchase the screen became pixilated and flickers and eventually went black. Samsung claims they don't cover the international LATAM phones under their product warranty even though it was purchased in the USA for international travel purposes.
"Do not buy this phone it does not work and is NOT unlocked as advertised. This is false advertising and wasted my time and money. I now cannot call my family while deployed into war, wasted my time."
I received the phone in sealed box. It was in good working order. It still is. Everything is fine.
all good
i love this phone and am enjoying it!!!
perfect
"This phone is by far one of the best on the market. After reading the reviews left by some of the buyers, there seems to be some confusion on what seller to buy it from. My phone, which is real, and came factory sealed, was bought from ""The Coos"". However, to my understanding, there is no one out there making fake edge phones. The phone is just too complex to duplicate. What might be happening is the phones could possibly be getting damaged during the shipping process. The phone is glass, so if the shipper isn't packaging it correctly, it could absolutely take on damage. This is why I recommend, that if you are planning on buying this phone from amazon, make sure amazon is the one fulfilling the order. I have had no problems at all when I order from a third party that allows amazon to fulfill the order. Also, it doesn't hurt to review the customer reviews on the actual seller as well.As far as the phone itself goes, it works perfectly. All the specs pretty much define what to expect from the phone. It's got the best screen in the world and the best camera. The glass finish makes it beautiful, but it's fingerprint prone and and extremely slippery. Other than that, I have no complaints."
The phone is great all the features are amazing there is now a front light for along self-esteem just like how snap chat does it the Camera quality is awesome. The battery life is great and it charges quicklyBut within less than a week phone haven't dropped or anything I saw 4 grey translucent lines come upon the screen sometimes when you turn up the brightness it goes away but who wants to have the brightness so high?? I'm trying to find out how I can get this fixed
Very Happy with my item it was exactly as described and it arrived on time.
the best one in the store
"Two weeks after I bought it, it got problem. :(it got wet and failing the microphone, I hated it because I was told that the water proof was really good. Take care with SAMSUNG."
I love the phone. Seller ships on time. Brand new unopened box.
"Love this phone, only problem i had was i didn't know you needed a nano SIM card. I had a regular SIM card and it cost me another $20 to go to get. But other than that it's going to be great I love it and I think I might have it for a really long time, unless Samsung comes out with something way better than this."
Best phone ever.
Item came as described.
Like
It's an awesome phone for sure.
Love it.
Excellent mobile phone. Beautiful design with the best camera !
I use this phone good
very good
"Did not come with charger adapter as expected, otherwise its PERFECT"
Fast delivery. Product awesome.
The mother board came broken and I cant do anything
"It's a great phone, i recomend!"
Cost-effective.Product delivered exactly as advertised.
No stars if I could I got a GS7 no edge
"I'm really pleased with the product,Met my expectations and the information provided by the seller is correct as the photos.I really recommend the product because for me it was very useful.I hope my comments were helpful"
I dislike this product is not working good
"Great display, good battery life"
Good
I didn't like the fact that the phone came with a charger that can't be used because it doesn't have the prongs for this country and all instructions were in another language
"I paid for a new phone, but the phone I received was already set up and displays 7 voicemails from the 19th of April thru the 13th of May, and the plastic film was put back on upside down. WTH! Sadly not only are they thieves, but they are incompetent thieves!"
"Liked a lot the device. Only thing that came with very low, cheap quality was the AC adaptert. Look like the one you buy in grocery shop at half dollar. All accesories came within sealed box (headphones, sim remover, usb adapter, charger, device, etc)"
"Excellent and awesome phone! I think I won't upgrade this phone 2 years 'cuz it has everything! micro SD, OUTSTANDING battery! water and dust resistance and AMAZING and colorful screen! and flawless performance! It's just magnificent!"
Not sure why the reception is so weak Bad antenna ?
"Hands down the best cell phone I have ever owned. I have a iPhone 6 for work which I love, but this S7 beats it by a mile. Battery life is outstanding unlike so many Android phones, and the display and camera are top notch. I like this international version with the non-US processor and it seems to be getting better battery life than the Snapdragon processor for the domestic market. Either version though is still the best on the market."
The Q&A said this comes with a US power adapter. Mine did not. I got the German pin-type power connector without any adapters for the US.
Excelente
This cell phone is so pretty，I love the edge！But sometimes it will overheat.
I am not happy with the phone because according to the phone description your website the phone should have two slot sin your website the phone should have two slot for SIM card as was described for the middle east and African version. So I send the form back home which is Ethiopia for my sister so she will be able to use it for school but now she can't use it for school. And I bought that phone for $660 and I have no use for it now thanks
As described
"Marvellous phone! Just as expected. Arrived some days late but I'm sure it was because the company ships all their orders in an specific date and that's why they offer several days or hours to order for the Prime Shipping. The first day I used it, It overheated A LOT, I was worried because I didn't want to return it after all the days I waited and the complication of waiting again for another one. But i searched the problem up and its normal for it to occur the first day, its setting up anyways, first day of startup. Until now, I've had it for about 2 months. The S7 Edge, exceeds expectations. Runs games smoothly and fast! The ability to switch apps and for them to stiill be active is amazing. Great phone, I'll update this soon with more information on how I'm doing with it."
"I really liked this phone, also I am so glad about amazon's services thank you for everything."
all according to expectations
Came with scratches on the lower right hand corner. Everything else was in good shape.
the phone just lasted two weeks then starts going freeze and doesnt turn on again
"Everything is perfect with the device but one of the sides of the box was ripped. Plus they gave me an adapter that works for England, not the US version."
the best phone out there
"excellent product smartphone came as I wait for Maracaibo, Venezuela 100% recommended"
Package was not damaged and I loved the box of the phone. Appearance mean everything and the seller passed with that.
"Great Phone, great price, recieved Phone on time as promised. Thank you."
"this is the best cell phone I have. The size is almost the same as Samsung S5, except the format edge give us a very pleasant touch and view! The camera is exceptional, have auto focus and it is impossible to have bad pictures. The only problem is that it is so sensitive that a single harder touch can become multiple pictures..This is definitely the BEST SAMSUNG S series phone, and if the money is not the problem, forget the S7 and go to the S7 Edge!!!"
Great product so far..
S7 edge is the best
So far no!!!!!! I ordered the Samsung galaxy s7 EDGE GOLD and received the regular s7 in silver like wtf
"Very good phone. It's an international version, with adapter."
Excellent
Excelent!!
Excelente gracias
"I usually read reviews bedore ordering anything, and therefore I was very anxious while ordering the phone. Various users various experiences.But for me, i got a good deal on device. I got it whithin a week. And its a Latin American version with US wall charger.And so far device is performing as it should be.10/10"
Excellent Very thank you
Phone stop working in 3 months
"Hello, shipping has come to the House of my friend in Miami. I traveled the day November 15, that day I will know if you are all well. thank you."
"The seal was broken. The phone was completely fine, and it is the original phone. Other than that, all as is to be expected - great product!"
"Everything as expected, better than punctual. I missed that the charger was not compatible with 110w plug but it came with a converter."
It's an excellent phone very fest and he has an excellent reception. Also the battery is very very good doesn't run out but if you have small end it's hard with the hedge
"If I had the option of voting ""Zero"" stars I would. I bought my Galaxy S7 Edge and paid full price for it less than 7 months ago. Now the phone is presenting a hardware problem which was already acknowledged by Samsung that it is a factory problem, what means, they know it is their problem and that they are supposed to get it fixed or exchanged. However, because it is an ""Unlocked International Version"", no Samsung authorized service would even touch the phone. Not even if I am paying for the service. So, now I have a USD 800 paper weight worth nothing at all. I hope Samsung is reading this. I have been a Samsung Loyal customer since Galaxy S II and now I am dropping this ""Loyalty"" for a Windows Phone (yeah, Windows Phone. After wasting my money with a ""Samsung Flagship"", a windows Phone is all I could afford to buy). Thanks Samsung, you have made an (ex) customer really (un)happy !!!!!!"
"My boyfriend got this phone over the summer, and he actually likes it much better than his former iPhone. It comes with earbuds, a charging cable, and a very useful charging adaptor to accommodate different charging ports. I personally think it's too big, but I have small hands haha. Overall, a very reliable phone that works really well."
"phone is good, but the seller is a swindler"
"I will never again buy a phone through a cell service provider. Buying unlocked through Amazon or some other reputable source saves you about 20%, and here's the really great part: no bloatware! Be careful to ensure that the phone will work with your service provider, but if it will this is the way to go without a doubt."
Awesome phone!
Good
"I use StraightTalk with this phone. It took no more than an hour to transfer my phone number to this phone, and I had exactly 0 issues with it since. If you want a brand new unlocked phone, I would recommend no further than this. It did come with some sort of foreign software, and Facebook and Instagram seem to be installed and non-removable, but they were trivial to disable."
good
"Easily the best phone I've owned. Period. Great battery life compared with my last 3 phones (xperia Z2/Note 4/LG G4) Extremely fast, reliable, easily manages all my applications (55), great camera, waterproof.. And on and on... Great phone.. Really worth the price. Chose it over the S7 due screen size and battery life expectancy."
no 4G LTE .. Wireless PLACE..w
Those black lines showed up from no where. I don't know what is the problem . I would like to get an exchange please
I'like. Good product.
It's not working. I need new one Tuesday. Wednesday I'm going back to Turkey. If I can't get one till Tuesday it doesn't matter what I liked or disliked about this
Hi thereI ordered this samsung galaxy s7 on jun 17 nd everything was very very great until 2 week ago i just realized that in the screen there is one pixel wrong. Is almost imperseptible but if you focus on this pixel you can see how s*** it looks like
Techno master always send products that after 2 weeks you start seeing the defects. It has happened twice in less than 2 months.
"DO NOT TRUST this product on this seller.I bought TWO WEEKS AGO and the device showed:1.) problems with fingerprint lock. Basically this feature adds 30 seconds of waiting time before using your phone, since it consistenly does not work, and it locks your phone after 3 tries.2.) Phone would consistenly freeze (once a day) with the watch on. The only solution is restaring the phone. and the freezed clock is an extra because it made me lose a few meetings.3.) ""unbreakle glass"" screen broke after ONE WEEK OF USE, in my FRONT pocket, without never even even falling on the flor. it was ONE SINGLE coin that made the damage."
"My husband and I bought these as an upgrade from our previous Galaxy S5s. I got the rose gold and he got the black one. The rose gold color wasn't as rosy as I thought it would be, it's more of a champagne color. The black one looks very sophisticated and elegant. I must say that I was not a fan of Samsung borrowing Apple's idea of no memory storage and making it difficult to put the sim card in but it was an easy fix with being able to send all of my extra photos to my Samsung account. Upon arrival, the packaging makes sure the product is not harmed whatsoever (lots and lots of bubble wrap). In all honesty I was afraid the phone was not going to hold up very long because of the glass edge and because I'm prone to dropping my phone...a lot. However even with out a case it has held up quite well. The photo quality of the front and rear camera is amazing, definitely a step (or two) up from the S5. We decided to buy on amazon because the price listed was $200-$300 cheaper than buying in stores, plus free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime. All in all I would highly reccommend this phone if you're a Samsung lover like myself."
LED screen started to flash in and out and show a blue screen after 3 weeks. Battery is already over heating after 3 weeks of use. Battery life sucks.
Inserted AT&T and works absolutely fine.Great phone.
"I bought the cellphone as gift for my brother, and to honest, he's really happy.Service was really good, I'm really satisfied about the product and also the serviceGood job!"
I love it

All good
Excelente!!!
After 2 months the display look weird! Colors everywhere.
Good price
I love it... :-)
"The phone is great, works well with at&t services"
Liked it awesome.....
Excellente
Love this phone. Very nice and beautiful. Fully unlocked to all networks and 32gb is plenty of space. Curve screen looks great but functionality not overly used.
Pay a great price for an excellent product. A++++
Is a great smartphone... my gift for Christmas... the cellphone was delivered without problem. 100% recomended
"The screen cracked completly with a fall on the ground when I was going up in a car. So it was not a big distance or fall. I used to have the S6 edge, and definitly had more falls and from much higher distances, and this never happened before. This was the first fall, and it breaked a lot. And after the minutes where passing, it where cracking more and more. I'm not living in the USA, so I had to fix the screen in my country, and the cost of a new screen was around 300 dollars. More than half of what the phone cost me. I can understand that if the phone fell from my pocket it's my fault, but what I don't understand is how fragile it is. Obviously, besides that, it's a great phone, but the fall was very light and the damage very strong."
"Nice looking phone, bought on april/2016, almost 7 months later my screen shows a dead pixel, it's suppossed that i have a one year international warranty, i contacted samsumg.com and the told me ""that the warranty does not apply if you buy on an online store"".For an expensive unit, i'm pretty dissapointed.Still wainting for seller to respond my email."
"This phone is good, somewhat slippery but good, but I have problem with Samsung. I ordered it from US to US and yet my phone can be repaired only in AFRICA? As it is unlocked International phone IMEI number does not exist in Samsung US database, where it is listed? Answer can be found only in the box, which can be read only after receiving the order: Africa!?!I believed that phone bought in US should be serviced in US. Period.It is verified original, made in Vietnam, and was working good until small fall resulted in flickering screen. Now I want to service it but Samsung holds this phone is not in database and suggest to send it to Nigeria, or Ghana...That is just wrong from a serious company. Therefore one star."
Im a die hard galaxy fan but im not made at the phone its self but its hardware 4 months after i got this phone i got this screen flickering glitch. And a week later the screen dosnt work i love the phone but my parents arent getting me a galacy anytime soon
Using it everyday and still rocking.
Do not buy this piece of garbage. If you break it it cost $400 to repai it. It broke the first time I dropped it.I called Samsung and they said our technicians can't currently repair Galaxy S7 Edge phones.Back to iPhone
bad
nice phone
Was as expected
Fantastic
"Love it!!! its so beautiful, so fast!!! I love it love it love it!!!"
Works great
"Arrived in great shape, very fast setup, works great! I have used over 3 weeks and this is a fantastic device."
It à good phone
"Great phone, everything looks nice, thank you. I'll be testing it and let everybody know how it goes. But so far it's awesome.It's been a while now and in gotta say this phone is fantastic. I've had a galaxy phone since the G-S2 till this one and believe me, this one is by far the phone I've ever had. Yes it can improve for example, the back cover would be great in aluminum (kinda like iphone) it'll prevent from cracking in minor accidents. The speakers can always be louder I guess. Oh yeah I forgot, the battery... Omg is the best thing ever, thank you Samsung you did great."
I've had nothing but issues with this phone since I got it. I have apps randomly opening and closing on it's own. I've read online that it is due to the screen being too sensitive. I've been waiting for a update from Samsung on this matter but it seems like my phone was from Egypt and I have not received an update yet. Pretty much the phone has been unusable for me because I can't even type or navigate the phone without it closing me out of applications or opening up ones randomly. I am very disappointed in this. What are my options?
"It is a great phone overall. It is running exynos processor, which was made by samsung. The packaging also include the American plug adapter since the device was made for European country. It is unclocked and works well of tmobile. It should work with other services as well."
Everything is good
Very good quality
Great
"Till now is very good, and I have it for 2 weeks. But I hope to be the same because I have a friend who had the same phone and her display was buried after one month and I heard that other people had the same problem"
cool
"I would like to report the following: 3 days ago after charged my cell phone it had a burst and broke the glass of Case Battery Door Cover the back, after the fact the battery does not hold more charge. Now I would like to know what will happen ?!!!"
Don't buy these phones because you will have to stand the loss like I did. I purchase this phone in July and when I returned home and start using the phone overheated and burnt the screen. I payee 400 USD to get it fixed and it still haven't fix properly and all Amazon did was sent me $150 for my troubles! I had a loss. I'm out of the country and not returning until May. My business with Amazon with Electronics are DONE! Even after fix there are two shades of light in the phone and the technician said it's a software problem. He said I should contact Samsung. I just gave up on everything.
Very nice.
"Shipment arrived on time. So far, the best phone I've owned. Takes some effort to locate and update the device firmware."
"The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a awesome phone, worth the price! Grateful to have compared to other smartphones."
It's ok 52%
"Good phone, works great on AT&T. They can't block WiFi Hotspot with this phone. I have unlimited data grandfathered but was never able to use my phone as a Hotspot with an AT&T phone. Only drawback is it comes with a European wall plug."
I was completely satisfied!
My seller Wlaphones did all as promised. They sent the phone in 2 days and had no problem no change the delivery address since I moved and totally forgot to make the change. 5 stars to the seller and 5 stars to the phone. I've had it for around 2 weeks and had no problems to activate it in TMobile. Amazing phone and great seller
"Is not a Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE.(SM-G935F) .It's a regular Galaxy S7 (SM-G930F)..accidental mistake or intentional error , But it's not the product that I payed for..I'am realy furious ..Be Carefully .."
The seller was good. They send me a sealed box. The problem is the phone. I bought it to use in Argentina. When I opened the phone in Argentina there was a pink line on the screen. It's a full pixel dead line across the screen. Y search on internet and it is a common problem with the edge phones and the solution is a new module/screen. There is no guaranty for me here.
"This phone is absolutely amazing. I could go on about the class leading camera, the all-day battery life, the amazing screen, the unquestionably useful Always On Display. That's probably not the most impressive thing about this phone though. Think about an iPhone 6/6S/7 Plus. Now think of the most annoying problem with that phone. If you're like me then the most annoying problem is undoubtedly the ENORMOUS bezels on the side of the phone. For those of us who want a bigger screen (because it usually means more features/a better viewing experience) the iPhone is damn near impossible to hold in the hand because after the screen ends, there is a huge swath of space on the sides that add several critical millimeters to the width of the phone. Not with this phone. The curved display not only looks amazing, but serves to give the phone a very compact footprint for the 5.5"" screen you are getting.That being said, there are things I don't like. Samsung still needs to make their software more stable and less energy inefficient. The longevity is more a virtue of the large battery than the software. Additionally the software can sometimes have funny quirks. Nothing too bad, but just things that are a little weird or slow sometimes.I also recommend that you buy a case for this phone. More than anything else on the market it's a work of art and you'll want to preserve it. I personally recommend this: Spigen Thin Fit Galaxy S7 Edge Case with SF Coated Non Slip Matte Surface for Excellent Grip for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 2016 - Black. This case is thin and almost feels like it isn't there. It'll make your phone easier to grip and give you piece of mind while you're out all day with it."
Received the phone and it was cracked
"Don't buy anything from this seller/company. I bought a Samsung Galaxy s7 edge, not even 2 months after the cell phone stopped working, Plus they don't accept returns."
Pretty nice phone. it looks great. it is very fast and i love the camera.
"I purchased this phone for the expressed purpose of developing VR projects for Gear VR and Google Cardboard. I never expected or intended to use the phone features of the device. So I never added a SIM card much less carried it around or away from my office. After a couple of weeks the OS seemed to have crapped out and got itself stuck on some green terminal looking boot screen. Despite all my attempts to force a restart, perform a system restore, drain/charge the battery or whatever Android lets you do by holding in button X while closing one eye and whistling a happy tune, the phone just won't get past that Bootloader exception screen.I'm not an Android guy and since the purpose of the phone was to test apps, the device was required to be as close to stock as possible to adequately replicate the experience someone might have on their own device. By that I mean I didn't ""root"" the phone or mess with the OS beyond letting Android run all those auto updates it seems to do on a daily basis.I contacted Samsung US support and they said my phone didn't exist as far as they were concerned because it was obviously an international device. They told me to determine the country of origin and arrange service there.How convenient.I looked for some type of local resource that can service phones but it appears all that can be done are screen or battery replacements. Anything heavier has to go to the manufacturer...in Spain...or Antartica...or the Moon.I contacted the Amazon Marketplace vendor (Mobiles International LLC) that I purchased the phone from and they we nice enough in their correspondence and said:""Unfortunately Samsung does not provide warranty service on international unlocked phones. If you sent it to us in Miami, we can get a quote from a Samsung authorized service center to get the phone repaired. It looks like a software issue and should be fixable.""I FedEx'd them the phone and waited and waited. After two weeks or so I sent them an email wondering if there was any update.""At this time we have not received a quote unfortunately, the Samsung repair center here cannot repair your device because it is not Latin. We have one other option that we are trying. We will contact you as soon as we get a response.""And waited and waited...till about a month and half had passed and got this:""We received the unit back from Samsung this week. They returned the unit saying the warranty was void. We have shipped back to your address yesterday.""Huh? Is Samsung saying that I dropped it in a toilet? Or that I used my considerable phone hacking skills to circumvent their awesome software and install my own custom OS? No idea.So the lesson being, read the fine print. International unlocked phones may or may NOT come with a warranty. And even if you work yourself past that little detail and decide to roll the dice...if something goes wrong with your device there appears to be no recourse to have it repaired.Even if you expect to pay for said repair because the assumption being that a repair would cost less than the cost of a new phone there doesn't seem to be any reasonable way to facilitate getting it fixed. Waiting weeks and weeks to get some vague note about the warranty being void is hardly a workable solution."
announcer says that phone waterproof . He entered the water to photograph and phone filled with water and stopped working.
Love the phone but the front glass cracked within the first month with no foreseeable way of having ii repaired for much less than the cost of a new phone.
Best phone I ever had. Period.
Love it
I love it. It's beautiful
I didn't even download one app and the phone started heating up to the point that I couldn't touch the sides of the phone. I reset it twice and the phone was leggy as if it was an s2. I'm getting another one and after that one doesn't work which it obviously won't seeing that this crappie one almost melted I'm reporting them as frauds.
Best phone ever u till the note 7
I love it
The cel phone came with a burned pixel that didnt fix... the rest was ok
best way of online shopping for people who work on cruise ships
Works great worth the buy
all perfect!
Great phone. Improved battery life. Awesome camera.
"Problems with my product samsung galaxy s7 edge:1. Samsung galaxy s7 edge Box was not sealed2. It was labelled International version at the bottom of the box and also labelled American sim only at the back of the box3. After starting the device, I noticed the bottom right corner of the screen had a little blacked out portion on the display itself. (maybe damaged item was sent)4. When I opened the unsealed box, content was not arranged as it should be ideally. (It was messed up)"
Amazing smartphone. It's highly recommended
Broken phone!!!!!
Because the wife likes it
Good
"I love my S7 edge, the only thing is sometimes gets too hot."
This is the first phone I've had that didn't annoy me with its sluggishness. Battery lasts a long time.
I got what I was expecting. Thanks
All is great
"Everithing it's ok, the cell phone is amazing."
Because I think it is the best to have
great
"1) Great phone. Works as expected.2) Giving 5 stars for the great customer support, helped me to solve my issue really fast."
"Excellent product, it did came unlocked as mentioned with no trash applications pre-installed. It comes in the sealed Samsung box and comes with charger adaptor for America since it comes with a different charger for European wall plugs."
Amazing phone. Completely satisfied.
everything is perfect except the battery that doesn t last a complete day...
"I am coming from Note 3. Tried and returned the following phones:Nexus 6 – very poor battery life for massive screen, but overall quite good;Nexus 6P – very bad sound quality (low volume, very low volume), build quality (headphone jack broke in 10 days)I did not want to go with Samsung just for the fact that they do not stand behind their products and make their products obsolete and not supported after 2 years. Not acceptable for me, and my Note 3 still works great even though it is running in KitKat.But anyway, I was getting tired finding a good Android phone. By that time every manufacture has to produce a great phone, which has great OIS camera, good CPU, bright screen and be nice looking with strong materials. But looks like every manufacture is failing to do that. Some have good screens, bad build quality, some just bad battery, or bad internals. I see only Samsung is making something decent I can live with: Great design, strong body, good and stable software and have ability to root.So after multiple tries with others, I decided to go back to Samsung.Let me start with things I do not like about it.1. Edge screen is too sensitive and I think there should be an option to disable edge touch, or make it app specific. Forget about quality typing with one hand. You will always hit backspace or other keys on your right (if you are right-handed) with your palm. Waiting for a case to see if this going to help. This is huge -1 star for this device);2. Home button is still sticking out of the body. Why not to flash it so there are no accidental wake ups while in the pocket or somewhere else?3. Fingerprint is not good. Nexus 6P had the best and was fastest. Here it fails to recognize in a lot of occasions even while trying to set it up. BTW, why only 4 fingerprints can be setup. Why not more? I was setting up the same finger touching with different sides of the finger in case I need to unlock from different angles.Now what I like:1. Screen brightness – great. The best among all the phones on the market;2. Sound quality (music) over headphones and Bluetooth. BUT. Sound quality is not that good using original signal processing. I am very peaky for bass and treble. That is why I was looking for a phone, I can root and install Viper4Android to make phone sound perfect.3. Like headjack on the bottom, now you can slip you phone in the pocket without flipping it over to make headjack on the top while it is in your pocket.4. Completely unlocked phone vs Snapdragon model where bootloader is locked. I installed Custom Recovery, rooted phone, installed Wanam Xposed framework and Viper4Android. These pieces of software is a must for me. Wanam provided me with long press back button to kill process, long press volume keys to switch tracks, remove annoying popup when headset volume is high and some other features. And Viper4Android makes sound like no one else can produce.5. Always On Screen – love it. Does not look like it drains a lot of battery if at all;6. Build quality – gorgeous. Back does not feel glass though. But I am going to put case on it anyway.7. Battery – very easy to make though the day or two. Used it with Navigation and screen ON for 2 hour drive. Battery went down only 15%.8. Taking pictures – very good and I like the fact that it is wide angle. Both front and back camera took very good pictures even indoors, while at the dance competition. Focus is lightning fast.9. Connectivity – very strong and where my Note 3 or Nexus 6P were struggling for LTE signal (AT&T), Galaxy S7 was fine.10. Call quality – it feels like a person is just next to you. Very clear and solid.11. Glad that Samsung did not remove the option to scale screen. Unfortunately they only provide 2 options: Standard and Condensed, but at least something. Nexus 6P gave me more options from 400 dpi to 640 dpi. But I had Cyanogenmod running on Nexus 6P.12. Performance – very fast, no lags at all.13. Google Pay is working on it even I am rooted and have Wanam installed. Made first payment today and it was good.Overall looks like it is a keeper, but if edge screen sensitivity is not fixed, I will exchange that phone to Note 6 in the near future. (Hope they will not make it with curved edge – I hate it)."
"I just bought this phone a few weeks ago and Im just lovin it, great performance, awesome pictures, I love the display and how smooth is"
"I moved from ios to android and i felt like coming back home. Phone display , camera clarity amazing. Gold colour looks superb. Iphone 6 was so borning and this phone feels very exciting. Price was also good for unlocked international verson. Battary easily works for day and half with moderate data usage throught day"
thieves 😠
Best phone ever
Love mine it's awesome😍
I love it so much thank you! Cant believe I bought this expensive fone as a reward to myself. Too expensive but its ok I am very satisfied and happy! Thank you Amazon!
OK
so good <3
All good
Love my phone Samsung is a boss
The charger comes with the UK Plug. Would have been nice to know it before buying it.
I cannot make video call
Excellent!!!!!!
Todo ok..!!
Excellent cellphone. Battery is amazing.
"I received this phone yesterday and instantly fell in love with it. I have owned several Galaxy phones (s3, s4, s4 active, and s5). So far I love it! It came sealed in the original box. I cannot use the charger adapter that came with it, but I expected that as it's an international version.I picked the gold color, it looks and feels elegant and sleek. I love the interface, the phone itself is super fast. The phone has a big, beautifully bright screen. I am still getting used to its size. The fingerprint scanner is noticeably better than that of the gs5. Both cameras take amazing pictures.I am one of those people that are constantly on their phones during most of the day. It has an excellent battery life and charges very fast.I did read a couple reviews where people complained about the phone slipping out of their hands. I have used an Otterbox Symmetry Series case since I took it out of the box and have not had that problem at all.My only complaint about this phone is that it does not have an IR blaster, but I can live with that.I will update my review in the future if anything changes.UPDATE:I have been using this phone for about a month now and it is still just as amazing as when I took it out of the box. It still has amazing battery life. I have a Pocket Juice power bank that I was using around noon every day with my Gs5 but I have not used it at all with this phone. It usually still has 15% after about 12 hours of use.I have not had any lagging or random restarts like I did with my Gs5. The phone is still amazingly fast and responsive.I have slightly tested the waterproofing of this phone. The fingerprint scanner does not work well when wet, but the touch screen is still responsive.I have a Otterbox Symmetry Series case that I use with this phone and I have noticed that it causes the Zagg Dry screen protector to bubble up around the edges (I would like to state that I did NOT allow the protector 24 hours to ""cure"" after applying before putting the case back on, so that could be the reason.) I have heard that with the edges it is hard to find a case/screen protector combination that doesn't cause bubbling at the edges.Overall I would definitely recommend this phone."
Nice phone
"Mejor, IMPOSIBLE!"
Phone came nice and all but won't hold charge. I need to charge it twice or sometime 3 times a day. I am thinking about doing a reset and see where it will lead me. But now I am away from home and won't be back for 2 to 3 weeks in other to exchange it. Grrrr I hate this
Excelente!!!
After 2 months the display look weird! Colors everywhere.
Good price
I love it... :-)
"The phone is great, works well with at&t services"
Liked it awesome.....
Excellente
"Two weeks after I bought it, it got problem. :(it got wet and failing the microphone, I hated it because I was told that the water proof was really good. Take care with SAMSUNG."
I love the phone. Seller ships on time. Brand new unopened box.
"Love this phone, only problem i had was i didn't know you needed a nano SIM card. I had a regular SIM card and it cost me another $20 to go to get. But other than that it's going to be great I love it and I think I might have it for a really long time, unless Samsung comes out with something way better than this."
"Hello, shipping has come to the House of my friend in Miami. I traveled the day November 15, that day I will know if you are all well. thank you."
"The seal was broken. The phone was completely fine, and it is the original phone. Other than that, all as is to be expected - great product!"
"Everything as expected, better than punctual. I missed that the charger was not compatible with 110w plug but it came with a converter."
It's an excellent phone very fest and he has an excellent reception. Also the battery is very very good doesn't run out but if you have small end it's hard with the hedge
"If I had the option of voting ""Zero"" stars I would. I bought my Galaxy S7 Edge and paid full price for it less than 7 months ago. Now the phone is presenting a hardware problem which was already acknowledged by Samsung that it is a factory problem, what means, they know it is their problem and that they are supposed to get it fixed or exchanged. However, because it is an ""Unlocked International Version"", no Samsung authorized service would even touch the phone. Not even if I am paying for the service. So, now I have a USD 800 paper weight worth nothing at all. I hope Samsung is reading this. I have been a Samsung Loyal customer since Galaxy S II and now I am dropping this ""Loyalty"" for a Windows Phone (yeah, Windows Phone. After wasting my money with a ""Samsung Flagship"", a windows Phone is all I could afford to buy). Thanks Samsung, you have made an (ex) customer really (un)happy !!!!!!"
"My boyfriend got this phone over the summer, and he actually likes it much better than his former iPhone. It comes with earbuds, a charging cable, and a very useful charging adaptor to accommodate different charging ports. I personally think it's too big, but I have small hands haha. Overall, a very reliable phone that works really well."
"phone is good, but the seller is a swindler"
Great phone! Great Seller!
This is an Arabic/arab version . The retail box came opened. Not sure if it is new.
Very nice device. I would recommend it
My seller Wlaphones did all as promised. They sent the phone in 2 days and had no problem no change the delivery address since I moved and totally forgot to make the change. 5 stars to the seller and 5 stars to the phone. I've had it for around 2 weeks and had no problems to activate it in TMobile. Amazing phone and great seller

The seller was good. They send me a sealed box. The problem is the phone. I bought it to use in Argentina. When I opened the phone in Argentina there was a pink line on the screen.

Pretty nice phone. it looks great. it is very fast and i love the camera.
"Be careful , It comes with UK Plug ."
"Excellent screen, fast, good battery life, has met my expectations."
"Good seller, product as per description."
"Buyers Be AwareThis shipper has send me 'FAKE"" Samsung cell phone.Everything looks almost similar to the original Samsung but many features do not work especially the Camera makes terrible low pixel pictures, no screen stability, always lagging behind and many more.... buyers be aware.Although I send it back immediately, I am still working to get my money back."
just what I was looking for
Best phone I've ever bought!
It was to expensive. And it does not get fully charged in 4 hours and it does not stay charged more than 12 hours. I like my LG flex better.
Excellent product!!!!
It was good
I LIKE PHONE PROBABLY MORE THAN ANY I HAD SO FAR ESPECIALLY CAMERA AND IT FUNCTIONS GOOD SO FAR'
"Beautiful cell phone, light weight, thin, good screen size, lots of functions. As soon I inserted the SIM card it gat connected to my provider. Its working fine"
"International phones can not be repaired in the US. Despite the cost of this phone, it is a piece of crap. Samsung customer support will not help. LCD problem in less than 3 months with minimal use, and NO damage. Not even a scratch on the phone, yet it is almost useless. There are smart phones selling for $10.00. This one cost me $850.00 and did not last long. BUYER BEWARE."
"Excellent! Great design, smart, camera is wonderful even in the night time with bad light. Sensitive screen, fast internet... no problem. Thank you.Delivery in time."
I love it
Love it. Using it with MetroPCS.
Amazing
very fantastic am really enjoying the it
Excellent!
"I wouldn't recommend buying it online, the phone I got came good but then started acting weird. When I would send out pictures it would not send. Another thing is that when i plug in my earbuds they only work on one side. I checked with many other earbuds and its still the same side, so therefore the phone is defected. The warranty isn't good as well, they would not provide you with a replacement phone while they have it for repairs. Me as a business owner, I can't go without my phone over 12 hours."
Very happy with the purchase.
The best phone ever. Great camera. Buy it.
phone would not work unless plugged into the charger and its got an internal battery so i had to return it brand new phone
Work with metropcs YEAH
"I really liked this phone, also I am so glad about amazon's services thank you for everything."
all according to expectations
Came with scratches on the lower right hand corner. Everything else was in good shape.
the phone just lasted two weeks then starts going freeze and doesnt turn on again
"Everything is perfect with the device but one of the sides of the box was ripped. Plus they gave me an adapter that works for England, not the US version."
the best phone out there
"excellent product smartphone came as I wait for Maracaibo, Venezuela 100% recommended"
"Phone is very sleek. it looks nice and it has a lot of things going for it.- Water Resistance- Amazing and Fast Camera- amazing screen- pretty fast charging- Good Battery- Fast Charging- Fingerprint Scannerand others.but for all of its pro's it has a few Big Faults. The big one for me was how hot the phone got. For just using google Maps, to even playing Pokemon go for a little bit in the park, the phone got so hot I could barely hold on to it. I couldn't even imagine using this with a case on it might melt. Then when the phone detects that it gets too hot then it makes that big beautiful display lowers it brightness to where I can not see in the daylight anymore. I am having a lot of issue with it in the Sun.I have heard of these issues with other Samsung phones. Maybe its just the ones with this certain processor, I am unsure if the SnapDragon ones have this issues but the reason I got the international is that it could go to any carrier more or less and I could get the added performance of the Exynos Processor. Turns out it was a bad idea and the phone got so unreasonably hot that I could barely hold on to it. The phone also got noticeably slower as it got hotter. Probably because the processor was limiting itself.Maybe this could be fixed with a software update but I think this is more of a hardware issue. Maybe I just got unlucky and got a defective phone as i don't see many other people mentioning these problems. I do not blame Samsung or have any bad feelings for them. I just got unlucky with my device and will be returning it to Amazon."
"5 stars to the phone, 0 stars to ATT. ATT was not able to get 4G connection going on this phone. Blamed hardware. IMEI checked good. Phone would show 4G AP but could not establish data connection with it. Was only working with 3G AP at 3G speed.The thing that did the trick was temporarily inserting SIM card from friend's phone that was connecting 4G. My phone made 4G connection right away. Means hardware is good. Put back my own SIM card. Voila, phone still connects at 4G!"
"nice product, easy to use, but both front and back crack very easily."
Love it
The charger which was sent with the phone does not apply to the USA setting.it is really giving me a hard time to charge and I also expected the phone to come with a memory card but it does not have one.
Everything as should be... would buy from them again
nice phone very good
"Amazing phone. Bought it to use it in Argentina, 4G works perfectly. Packaging was inmaculate."
"Love Love Love this phone. The screen is crisper than anything I have seen, it's fast and beautiful. Life is good"
All excellent
Arrived early!! I was a bit hesitant getting the new S7 on amazon with not many reviews but Amazon hasn't failed me yet so I took the plunge and ordered it. I tested it with the Genuine Galaxy app and its a genuine unlocked Samsung phone. It works with my phone provider (in Jamaica). I am so in love with the phone.Everything is working really good.
"This phone is definitely one of the fastest on the market at the moment. I have dropped it several times on hard floors, and there is no visible damage at all. I have also handled it with wet hands, and it still works flawlessly. Although, the fingerprint scanner doesn't get along with water drips. The edge screen is a great addition, and I have gotten use out of the news feature when the phone is locked. The battery life is great, since it lasts about a day with moderate to heavy use.Also, for those who are wondering, this model supports most LTE bands, and it is also supported by most GSM carriers. I use it with Metro PCS, and it works perfectly."
Awesome
Legit Company. The phone is brand new no issues... & these guys are fast!!!
Great
I have it for a about a year and works great!
"Screen failed in under 4 months. No warranty, no repairs. You are paying for a future $600 brick."
Works with American AT&T no problems. The 4g lte symbol does not show up but I know I get the speeds. Very happy that I purchased it
"Love this phone so far. It has been reliable and works as advertised. This is the international version, which means certain apps, like Samsung Pay, don't work. It's only come up a couple of times, but it is annoying. Not a negative on the phone, it's clear that this is the case. Just wanted to spread awareness."
"do not buy a international phone some features will not work,,,,,,,,, This seller is slow on returns"
"I bought this phone in August for my wife, the phone has been a hassle from the get go. Two weeks after purchase the volume button started moving erratically on its own. Then the phone started hanging and will not reset by just switching off the phone, we need to hold the power button and the decrease volume button at the same time. The frequency of hanging just kept increasing, even after the doing a factory reset the phone continued to deteriorate. I am highly disappointed! I would have returned the phone if the window had not elapsed. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"
"Excelente Product!! No objections, just get a antislip case cause is like silk"
Its a bad experiencie because I Lost almost $120
"Sooo ummm I got it the next day after ordering it, which is crazy. I done my personal testing and I'm really Impressed makes my note 1 feel like a brick.... edited part: I dropped it in a huge puddle today sat for a good 7 mins under water, pulled it out and still works great"
Excellent
good
"Came in perfectly fine, works fine. Is sexy. Yes."
Love the phone I was a little scare at first because some of the paper instructions were in arabic but I put the phone to work without trouble manage to change the settings to english and spanish .It is a great phone charge really fast the adapter came for middle east kind of current but they were kind and send a travel adapter for it works great so far I am really happy thank you.
The phone was working pretty awesome then it just crashed and wouldn't turn on. Did all the troubleshooting I could and it still wouldn't turn on. So I had to return item.
"Excellent product, it cover al my expectations and more. The seller has a great attention."
Excelente
Loved!
Best Galaxy ever. Amazing.
Great product so far..
S7 edge is the best
So far no!!!!!! I ordered the Samsung galaxy s7 EDGE GOLD and received the regular s7 in silver like wtf
"Very good phone. It's an international version, with adapter."
Excellent
Excelent!!
Excelente gracias
Has lots of cool and helpful features. Performance is very good. I highly recommend purchase if you are considering switching or upgrading
I received the wrong power plug. Did not get the US type.
This phone is absolutely stellar. Amazing screen even in direct sunlight. Battery life is tremendous. The ONLY drawback is this version isn't compatible with Samsung Pay at this time in the US.
Great phone. Improved battery life. Awesome camera.
"Problems with my product samsung galaxy s7 edge:1. Samsung galaxy s7 edge Box was not sealed2. It was labelled International version at the bottom of the box and also labelled American sim only at the back of the box3. After starting the device, I noticed the bottom right corner of the screen had a little blacked out portion on the display itself. (maybe damaged item was sent)4. When I opened the unsealed box, content was not arranged as it should be ideally. (It was messed up)"
Amazing smartphone. It's highly recommended
Broken phone!!!!!
Because the wife likes it
Good
"I love my S7 edge, the only thing is sometimes gets too hot."
Exelente
Best phone I've ever owned!
got the phone works great
Great phone! My first Samsung and plan to continue with this brand!
"As soon as i got this i have yet to put it down, SUPER FAST, AMAZING SCREEN, its the dream phone i have been waiting for. Easy to transfer my data to the new phone, very thing and light, when i first held it i was like ""omg this thing is super light"" like i would drop it forgetting about the weight of it lol Only thing i was ""eh"" on about getting it was the seal was detached from the box(wasn't broken but the adhesive was rubbed off from shipping/warehouse), and the branding that usually says ""S7 Edge"" on the back is not on this model which i think is a good thing but made me feel for about an hour ""man i got a fake"" but it was not the case at all, it felt like the real deal. I checked the settings and the software is super snappy and easy to use, in the ""about phone"" section of settings it does say model number and the phone type as what it was advertised.PRO:~Amazing screen~Great build~Wireless Charging/Water Resistant(i have tried the water resistance and i say it works, had residue from the stickers and so i ran under tap water and cleaned that right off)(i have yet to try wireless charging yet)NEUTRAL:~Battery(it seems great but at the same time not so great. I woke up at 7am with 100% and then by 8:45am its at 85% so i still great but i feel by the end of the night ill have 10% left or less. I am a heavy user when it comes to my phone)CON:~Charger it comes with is foreign(my seller gave me an adapter with my phone, but i don't know if that's every purchase so be well aware it MAY NOT come with an American Adapter)As far as i can tell that's about it so far, i will update my review when and if anything changes. Yet to test wireless charging but plan on picking one up soon and will add an edit to this."
"It is good phone, came on time. It is not fake. Everything was good but my messanger is not working properly."
The phones features are great. The only thing is that... I've had the phone for a week and not dropped it once. Today the phone cracked when I dropped it... I was sitting on the floor when it slipped from my hand less than a foot up and the entire screen cracked. This material that it's made from is terribly fragile.
Great!
Vera Good!
Goodd nice
the best
Shipped in a reasonable time frame and worked with my carrier (t-mobile). First time I have ever bought a phone outside my carrier so I did a lot of research and I am well pleased with the result. The processor (this one has the international processor--much faster than the US processor) and battery life is wonderful!!! Right now it's 5:04pm and it's been off the charger & heavy use since 7am and I have 60% battery!
i only had my phone for about 3 weeks and the screen start jumping rapidly
Awsome!
Great item still testing durability and exploring features.
every new phone has firsttime open setting.but it already opened and has 7% power left when I got it .even when I Check the background.there has some apps .one of them is setting.I use to worked in a store(someone like bestbuy) in china.i was the manager of 3C(cell phone .camera )department.so I know what we did to the returned phones.but to renew a phone.at least clear the data and make sure no one will know.please do things professional.
"Awesome phone, great build quality, very slim, i had a samsung galaxy S3 before, and that phone last like 8 months, hate it samsung for their build quality, since then i've been trying another brands, so i decided to give samsung another try and guess what i love this phone, my only complain is the battery it doesn't last long like the iphone 6s plus, it has one of the best AMOLED screen i have ever seen the color are very bright and clear so if you want a phone buy this one you'll not regret it."
"Really is an amazing phone well worth the upgrade,"
The phone is really good
"It is slippery. But i mean really really slippery. It is so slippery that it can be used to grease a pan. I heard that in the dictionary they added a picture of the Samsung S7 in the word slippery definition. It is THE MOST slippery thing i have ever seen in my entire life. You couldn't hold it with your hands even if you had frog fingers, because it is so slippery. If you don't mind a slippery phone, go ahead, but i must warn you.. it is very slippery. Very very slippery.(Ps. I tried to add a photo of something very slippery so you can relate but couldn't find, cause all i can think of a slippery thing is Samsung S7)"
Very good
Everything was ok the phone is great :)
The best smartphone.I feel like a baby with new toy.
"I bought this phone one week ago... I have no idea why there're some black stripes on my screen. When I increase the light, it's smaller..."
"I by the phone , and the screen have black point in corner left side..is damage.."
When I purchased this phone I was under the impression that it was unlocked. Now I find that it only works with at&the This is a scam . This phone only works on the AT&T network. It will not work on Verizon. Do not be fooled. This phone is not unlocked.
"Awesome device, water resistant, pretty fast. It's going to work with a lot of carrier all over the world. Beautiful external case made of glass. Samsung did it pretty good this time, for sure. The product came with an adapter for if you want to use it in the US. Another important feature is that you can still use this in the US and have the 4G compatibility, the only thing that you are going to miss it is the processor as the other US version has a better processor using the snapdragon 820. However, the Samsung exynos is pretty powerful too, so you probably wont feel the difference."
I received my package with no phone just a charger and headphones. Complete rip off!
Best phone ever it was easy to activate in my mobile service.
"This phone is the best i've ever had so far! If you have the cash and looking for a new phone, do not hesitate on buying it!"
thank you for my phone
Only head the phone a few days and already it has glitches. The volume will randomly turn itself back on from vibrate without anyone even touching the device and also the power button sometimes woulnt work
Great phone but charger was not original everything else it great
"I bought this cell some days ago and I couldn't be happier. This Latam version is working fine in Argentina. It's good to check before you buy if you cell works with in your country and carrier at [...] , very helpful...Thanks."
"The gadget works perfectly in Brazil, with VIVO 4G, but the battery life is poor."
Like
It's an excellent phone...
Very good
It stoped to work after 2 months. I am very disappoint.
"The features are OK, but it's not a great value. Not a huge step up from the Galaxy 6. If you have a Galaxy 6 edge and are looking to upgrade, hold off on this one. It's not groundbreaking stuff. More of the same."
Hi thereI ordered this samsung galaxy s7 on jun 17 nd everything was very very great until 2 week ago i just realized that in the screen there is one pixel wrong. Is almost imperseptible but if you focus on this pixel you can see how s*** it looks like
Techno master always send products that after 2 weeks you start seeing the defects. It has happened twice in less than 2 months.
"DO NOT TRUST this product on this seller.I bought TWO WEEKS AGO and the device showed:1.) problems with fingerprint lock. Basically this feature adds 30 seconds of waiting time before using your phone, since it consistenly does not work, and it locks your phone after 3 tries.2.) Phone would consistenly freeze (once a day) with the watch on. The only solution is restaring the phone. and the freezed clock is an extra because it made me lose a few meetings.3.) ""unbreakle glass"" screen broke after ONE WEEK OF USE, in my FRONT pocket, without never even even falling on the flor. it was ONE SINGLE coin that made the damage."
Excelent
"Good afternoon, this team that bought them, I was wrong. Does not work well, hangs up every few minutes. I have to remove the chip from the line for it to work. And then I bought it was for that, to use my line. I do not want this, I got damaged, I want my money back."
I had to return this great phone since the edge is way too sensitive and activates apps every time I touched the phone. Go for the 7 and not the 7 edge.
"It started off with buying one for my husband. Then I started playing around with his phone and fell in love with it myself. Had to buy a new one for me as well. One thing though, double check that it comes with an adapter for American outlets. My hubby's did, but mine did not."
It's Amazing 1+AAAAA
Excelent
Great!!!
perfect
so much better than getting the ATT version of the phone no bloat ware and you can teather with out having to buy the extra service from ATT
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CJU9BBM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
The mother board came broken and I cant do anything
"It's a great phone, i recomend!"
Cost-effective.Product delivered exactly as advertised.
No stars if I could I got a GS7 no edge
"I'm really pleased with the product,Met my expectations and the information provided by the seller is correct as the photos.I really recommend the product because for me it was very useful.I hope my comments were helpful"
I dislike this product is not working good
"Great display, good battery life"
"Excellent Phone, astonishing camera and amazing performance."
Perfect
Ok
Phone that I have received was broken. Whenever I take a picture under any kind of artificial light I get bright yellow/orange spot at the center which also shows up in pictures.
Optimo!
At first I gave this 5 stars. Now I'm giving it one because it has a vertical pink line going up and down the phone. I spent a crap load of money on this phone for it to be doing this. I will give it 5 stars again once the problem is fixed or phone is replaced
A+
"I have been a Samsung Galaxy owner before, but decided to make a change to a phone that started good then got worst.I used to own the s3 and I'm glad I made a comeback to Samsung once again.The international version seems to be faster and have a longer battery life than the last phone I used to own. With one charge it'll last me all day, while on the other phone I had to recharged it when I got home from work.The graphics are amazing and I haven't had any glitches or problems with the phone so far.I did buy a screen protector and phone case since I seem to break phones quite easy.The screen itself seems to be scratch resistant.As for water resistant I can't say anything since I haven't used my phone in the water, I don't feel confident enough to drop my phone in the water or have it in the shower.This is so far the best phone I've owned, it does not heat up as bad as my other phone and it has an elegant view."
 I Thought that the galaxy S7 edge is the best product but after just one week of use (it was not a massive use because it was my secondary phone) a black lines appeared on the screen when I change the brightness I reset the phone but I noticed it's a hardware issue not a software problem and I found myself unable to do anything because I am leaving the country
Amazing!!!
The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge got here on time and in great conditions it works great.
I'm sure you've seen tons of reviews about the phone so if you are going to get it this is a good place to do so.
"on time ,no problem ."
"I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935F in Black from this product page a week ago.A lot of people have asked questions about this particular international version so I'll answer some of those first. For starters, the one I got was the english edition for the Saudi Arabia market (see attached photos, the guides came in english and arabic). From what I can tell, the phone is the same as any other international edition but with different preinstalled apps. Mine came with a SA region specific app ""Shaid"" (seems to be a YouTube-esque app in arabic) that I uninstalled and WhatsApp. Other than that the only remaining bloatware was stock Samsung apps (no carrier apps, thank god), the only other thing I noticed that may be region specific is the S Planner app has a ""Hijri dates adjustment"" setting. Lastly this version ships with a non-us wall charger (aside from the regular stock accessories) shown in my review images. Mine also came with an adapter for use within the U.S., I have tried it and can confirm that it works with fast charging.This phone also uses a different chipset (manufactured by Samsung, called Exynos 8890) than the U.S. version. Reviews I read noted that the phone was actually optimized for this chipset w/ better performance and battery life than the U.S. Qualcomm counterpart (Google it). In the U.S. version the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip is used to support Verizon and Sprint customers whereas this version only supports GSM carriers.To preface the review of the actual use of the phone, I have owned the following devices and used them each as a daily driver for at least a months time: Samsung Galaxy S4 GPE, Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, HTC One M8 GPE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P. The Galaxy S7 Edge has been the most delightful experience of the bunch. I won't go into great detail here but the camera is phenomenal and launches faster than any other phone I've owned w/ a double tap of the home button. The camera's auto focus is super fast and I feel like I'm able to get a capture a lot of moments that my previous phones were too slow to shoot. It's also nice to be able to change the quick launch apps on the lock screen, I have the dialer and snapchat as mine.Continuing a theme of high performance this phone is incredibly fast despite powering a QHD resolution screen. Apps are surprisingly quick to load and multitasking is a breeze (I even found some use in the Samsung's split screen feature). The fingerprint scanner is on par with apple devices (and nexus 6p/5x) although because of it's non-circular shape I find that I place my finger the wrong way more often. The battery is the best of any device I've used as a daily driver, I've been able to get through days of heavy usage like today (unplugged from charger at 5:45am, now at 25% at 9:03pm).The screen is BEAUTIFUL. Not only is it easy to read even in direct sunlight (something I have seen other devices struggle with) but the colors are vibrant and the screen is huge without making the phone too big or bulky. Perfect for watching YouTube videos and browsing instagram.Lastly a few notes if you buy this phone:- If you're not a fan of the stock Samsung launcher you can get the Google Now launcher from the Play Store, it's the same one used on Nexus devices and feels smoother than Samsung's launcher.- This time around Samsung decided to give you bigger icons which drove me nuts, search for ""Get more on your Galaxy S7, S6 or Note 5 screen with hidden DPI scaling settings"" from Android authority to get a 5th column on the home screen and smaller UI elements.- ""Edge functionality"" is just okay. The feature feels a bit less than polished because of the weak offerings in the Samsung app store - I have it turned off.Edit 4/8/2016: sorry about the quality of the photos of the actual phone - they were shot with the wide angle lens of my GoPro whereas the other images were shot with the S7 Edge.Edit 4/10/2016: added some higher quality images from my new camera.Update 5/9/2016: I've been using the phone as a daily driver for over a month now. I'm still impressed by the overall gfx smoothness, how fast apps load, and camera performance.Update 7/25/2016: still in love with this phone. I'm honestly not sure what would compel me to purchase a new phone at this point.. I also rooted the phone and changed the emojis to the iOS 9 set with the Emoji Switcher app from the play store. No more guessing when messaging my iOS friends =)A lot of commenters have asked which seller I purchased mine from: Wireless Everything."
Great phone. Got it today and it's absolutely beautiful. Can't wait to give it to my boyfriend as a birthday present he will love it. So far IL very please and I'm sure I won't regret the purchase!
You must buy this phone!!!! Much better than iPhone!!!!
Very good item and fast shipping
"Although my shipping experience was a bit troublesome, the product itself its amazing! I knew it was international version but was not expecting a UK plug, best part is I get almost not bloatware"
"awesome phone, excellent camera, i bought 3 of these phones"
This is literally my first review because I never had a product that deserved my time...until I got this phone! It's absolutely the most amazing phone I have ever seen!Couldn't be happier!
"Samsung has made an absolutely Spectacular Phone with the Galaxy S7 Edge. Perfect Size; fits and feels well in the hand. Easy to use, the touch screen is brilliant, easy to see even outdoors, clear and crisp and the special edge feature of the screen makes this the most beautiful cell phone ever made. And that is just the beginning.The Camera in the New Galaxy S7 rivals many of the cameras you can buy for hundreds and hundreds of dollars! You can take Incredible photos in low light, great videos, even HD Video recording and much more. Removable Storage has come back with the Galaxy S7 and now you can insert micro SD cards with as much as 200GB of storage.You pay for high quality and the Galaxy 7 isn't cheap. But it is well worth it. BUY The New Galaxy S7 - you won't be disappointed."
"I'm very happy with this phone, fast hasn't fail and I had it for a week, I will update if things change but overall it's a winner"
"I already did wrote a awesome review for this phone, I even inspired myself like I was writing a poem and I gave 4 star to the phone but after 1 month and some days of use it started giving me problems, the phone restarts randomly out of nowhere, that has happened like 5 times and the then today I was just playing music and the lockscreen didn't work and the whole screen went black and none of the buttons were working to turn on the screen so I had it to do a massive restart, good thing it didn't erased all my stuff. I don't know if it has warranty or not but I'll be happy if I get my $850 back that I worked so hard."
"I was very surprise when I turn on the phone it seems that it was not new because it was already configured, I dont see the first time I turn on de Willkommen screen. It was configures in Dubai. The phone work, Also de charger is very sttrange , very big and with rare conectors.......The phone is very good but Im conserned that you send me something used whe I paid the full price."
"Great phone, though can be very buggy at times."
The phone is solid but I can't stand the edges. I ended up going back to the Note 5
"It seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves, who break the phone's box seal, open the box, and unlock the phones themselves (note that Samsung says ""do not accept if seal is broken""). Hence, technically, most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new. I bought a lot of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phones from Amazon, and most (not all) had the seal broken.On the phone itself, interestingly, the S7 Edge feels lighter than the S7 (even though it is 3% heavier ... maybe because the weight is distributed differently). The bigger screen is good for people with vision issues, but the resolution is the same as with the S7. The edges are highly annoying, making one touch them by mistake constantly. Furthermore, the edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case. I do not like this phone. I love the regular S7."
I received a wrong version...
The best Phone
"I'm so upset the phone keeps freezing and it just jumps from one app to the next without me selecting anything. Sometimes it don't allow me to restart it or turn it off. It also restart by itself sometimes, I'm very disappointed having me thinking if it's a refurbished phone."
"I am kind of angry to buy this and now I realized what the hack does international version mean. This is an international version which is far inferior to US counterpart. What I got is an Italian version. Some stupid Italian company's apps were pre-installed and cannot uninstall them.1. You cannot use Samsung pay with this version2. CPU is VFPv4 Neon which is far interior to the US version made by Qualcom3. I performed benchmarks with AnTuTu apps: SM-G935F (this model) is very under-performed. especially in graphics score 20781 (this model) vs 33831(Original US version) - this phone is around 35% under-performed than US conterpart.4. As I said, you cannot uninstall some stupid foreign cell-phone company's apps. Starting with foreign languages is a bonus.I hate Samsung to build these variations all the time to fool around the customers. Please check everything possible before you buy the Samsung products. AND buy US version all the time. This would not happen to Iphone which I used right before this one."
Switched from iPhone to this phone. After 1 week...No regrets.
<3 Great phone love it so far.
Absolutely love the phone. Best purhase I ever made!
"The screen, the edge, pictures are GORGEOUS! What's not to love!"
Like very much.
"I'm really liking this phone. To be fair this is my first flagship phone. I'm coming from a cheap Nokia Lumia 520 but figured for once I'd splurge and see what all the fuss is about on these top tier phones.The first thing I noticed is that the screen is absolutely beautiful. I couldn't get over how clear and lifelike everything looked. Also being able to actually see my phone's screen in the sun was a definite plus haha. OLED is just an awesome technology and I can't wait until TV manufacturers tweak the picture processing a bit. Just a great display.I haven't run benchmarks or anything but everything on the phone is very snappy. Going into the camera, opening/switching apps, playing games, watching movies, etc. all ran smoothly. I didn't notice any warmth or the phone running hot but that probably due to using a case. The call quality was fine and overall I'm really enjoying it.On the down side, I think the phone's a little awkward to hold or picking up from a flat surface. I got this case Galaxy S7 Edge Case, SUPCASE Full-body Rugged Holster Case WITHOUT Built-in Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (2016 Release), Unicorn Beetle PRO Series - Retail Package (Black/Black) and the rubber edges made a world of difference. It's no longer slippery and easy to pick up off of a flat surface. Nothing worse than paying for a phone like this only to drop it while trying to set it up!The only thing I'm hoping is that the battery lasts quite a long time. Not having easy access to it is kind of a bummer. As I just dropped nearly $750 on it and I don't upgrade phones every year I'm hoping it lasts awhile. As much as I really do like this phone I don't think I'll be spending this much on a phone again. The purchase was more to quell my curiosity about these high end phones so I can check that off my bucket list hahaI purchased the phone from Wireless Everything and it arrived brand new in a sealed box with all new components. I popped my SIM card in and I was off to the races. I never purchased an international phone so was a bit nervous but everything went extremely well. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative I would suggest the OnePlus3 or ZTE Axon 7. Very similar specs for 400 smackaroos."
Love it's very nice looking and the camera is outstanding.
"The phone keep freezing ,"
Love my new phone takes amazing pictures battery life is long lasting and works perfectly with straight talk 😊
Switched from an iPhone 5 and so glad I did. This is an amazing phone!
Good products
Excellent
"Great phone, very happy"
Good
"The phone it is ok.. but the charger dont work it for me, i am from latino america and the charger have an entrance different.. now i am looking for a charger in my country.. i paid 700$ and i can not charge my smartphone......"
"Greatest phone ever.I have used it for 9 days already and it's awesome.My only complaint is the lack of good glass screen protectors.First off the camera,it's awesome,although it's pretty similar to the S6.I wish they stayed at 16mp as it was 16:9 but otherwise, its great.It even has a wider angle,when zooming it had a tiny bit better quality than the S6 and autofocus is extremely fast.Low light was obviously insaneThe battery, this was one of my main concern with my S6 and the S7E battery is very good.The first days which tend to be pretty bad for battery life, where surprisingly good.I even had to drain it's battery sometimes.But to be honest it perfomed a bit worse than I expected, i mean, it's waaay better than the S6,but as a student I thought it would last me a bit more.I read articles on people saying they used their phone heavily and ended the day at 11:30 with 20 percent battery life(that was using bluetooth,nfc,location and wifi/lte on as they said) and in my experience, I have finished days with 35% battery from 7am to 11pm but only using either wifi or mobile data,no bluetooth or nfc,no location services on.So I think mi phone's battery is stabilizing yet(if someone can tell me if im right say it please!).As a student, I don't use my phone for long periods from 7 to 4pm.Maybe 15 min intervals or 30 minutes using gallery for photos,what really surprised me is that battery drained pretty fast sometimes and sometimes it almost didn't drain,which is weird.That's why I think it may be normal for the fist weeks(again,correct me if i'm wrong)BTW, I don't use powersaving,which I did on the s6 alwaysPower wise, It's an extremely powerful phone which can manage literally anything,and there's no lag with power saving on or off.There's not much to say.The phone is a bit bigger than the s6 and s6 edge.I strongly recommend it"
Cause it has everything.
Sleek phone. Looks great! A good size not too large. Fits well in my hand. Great camera and sound quality. Battery lasts for a day.
Phone seems refurbished. Google programs skip and it seems like it has a lapse from time to time. Slower than I expected and because of this I am afraid to test to see if it's waterproof as its supposeductive to be.
"Good phone, nice design as almost everyone would agree. But it is very fragile! I drop mine from 2-3 feet high and got the screen edge shattered."
Wonderful
Good product
It's awesome. Using it now to type this
It's perfect!!
It is easy usage.
It met my expectations
"The best phone you will ever have, can handle many applications in background and it still responds as expected, zero lags and the curved screen is the best.The phone came with the AC adaptor as it's for Africa but I had no problems at all, the quick charge is just amazing and the battery lasts the whole day (5am to 11pm) with no need to additional battery charges.Go for the gold version it's the most classy one. Some photos that I took they look so real. Enjoy!"
"Original, reliable."
"I really like the phone, but nobody mentioned that Samsung Pay does not work with this, the international version - I had to call Samsung Support to find that out.. disappointed and send it back for that reason..."
Good.. thanks...
"This is a great phone! screen, design, camera, you won't have complains. Except that there are options almost as good as that for a lot less money."
except samsung pay everything is good
I purchased this phone from world wide distributors early last month and I have had the phone for just little over a month and it is defective!!!! My screen keeps blanking out and there are lines which are running through the screen which proofs that the phone had some underlying screen issues prior to being purchased by me. As you can see from the picture you can swe the lines which for under the screen and each time I try to complete an action the screen is forever blanking out and having lines. I am requesting an immediate of my money as this has been a waste. Do not buy
"Love this phone, great battery life and it's silky smooth UI."
"I bought it six months ago. Now it has overheating problems and the screen is flickering. Without warranty service, buy this phone is a waste of money."
"Perfect!!, just as adviced"
it made for middle east so there is Muslim holidays in calendar and other apps installed
Excelent product.. love it.
Was completely understand impression it would work on US Verizon. It did not.
Everything is good
Very good quality
Great
ok
thanks very good
Perfect!!
All that I expected
"I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 and am absolutely Amazed by this phone. It can go for over two days before charging. It has none of the typical bloatware. It's supposedly waterproof but I don't plan on testing that on purpose. It's painful to have to pay the full price up front but it's worth it to not be at the mercy of your cell phone provider. I will never buy a locked cell phone from a cell phone provider again. I'm glad they brought back the SD memory slot, but I wish it had a removable battery. Other than that, I think the Galaxy S7 is one of the best phones on the market at this time."
"Excellent phone, I just wish it had all the band's of the phones so you can switch to any carrier like the nexus phones, and Samsung pay wish it had but I know because it's international it couldn't, but we'll made. :)"
Have had the phone for a month and just love it.
This is the first phone I've had that didn't annoy me with its sluggishness. Battery lasts a long time.
I got what I was expecting. Thanks
All is great
Love my new phone
"Excellent Smartphone. Great Camera, Awesome for multimedia."
"Incompatible with AT&T, no 4G reception"
Solid phone
Received product excellent phone.
This phone is manufactured for Asia market so if you live outside Asia you will not have it fixed by Samsung in you country!
very good
Factory seal was open and phone appears to be tampered with. Not sure if phone is a genuine Samsung phone or a knock off. Also weird software installed on phone as well. Not sure what else is installed. Will be returning ASAP.
It's a really good cell phone. The delivery time was great.
it Was perfect
The reception that I receive with this phone is HORRIBLE! I don't know how to fix this issue but i promise others will run into this problem. I'm not sure if it's because it's not optimized correctly for t mobile or what. It sucks honestly.
"Phone is great! It was a huge upgrade for me going from the Samsung Galaxy S5 to the S7 Edge. :) No problems as of yet, phone runs smooth and fast! I love the camera! The seller (Wireless Everything) was even kind enough to even include a US wall adapter along with the order."
Excellent product all on time
as advertised and totally pleased with
Excellent!!!!!
Everything was ok as far as I know. I got this for a gift and had it sent on to them so I would not receive it.
Great phone unloked. Work very good in US and Europe. Great customer service from amazon after a problem with the delivery
Package was not damaged and I loved the box of the phone. Appearance mean everything and the seller passed with that.
"Great Phone, great price, recieved Phone on time as promised. Thank you."
"this is the best cell phone I have. The size is almost the same as Samsung S5, except the format edge give us a very pleasant touch and view! The camera is exceptional, have auto focus and it is impossible to have bad pictures. The only problem is that it is so sensitive that a single harder touch can become multiple pictures..This is definitely the BEST SAMSUNG S series phone, and if the money is not the problem, forget the S7 and go to the S7 Edge!!!"
"Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G935F- Black OynxAbsolutely disappointing, the charging port was hurt at 4 days, and today after 10 days has begun to smoke and smell of burning. I'll have to repair the ""new"" cell. I'm angry and I'll never buy in this shop."
"It is perfect this phone . First time that I bought a phone online and I had a very good experience . It's in very good condition and I got the phone next day . The only thing it's that on the back doesn't say ""galaxy s7 edge"""
"Bought this phone and have had it for several weeks. Absolutely love it ! fast and smooth, battery life is amazing. I'm with AT&T and if you can sacrifice wifi calling... this is the way to go. although it doesn't have all the LTE bands I have absolutely no trouble. My job requires me to travel often and I get great coverage everywhere, even in the gulf of mexico. I am now an exynos s7 edge fan boy."
Excelente Producto. Vendedor Recomendable
"if u have tmobile by this with confidence I was very hesitant at first people saying this is designed for a different region, until i remembered that I am middle eastern and the phone I previously bought was designed for middle east and worked great here in the US until I decided to upgrade, the only difference you will notice is the pre installed apps for the region and that chargers may have different inputs because it was designed for Europe or middle east, my seller that i bought from solved the charger issue by providing a complementary connectorgo for it, be brave for once."
"Everything went well, excelent product. Hope do not explode!"
i love my galaxy s7 i have no words
Great
"I purchased this S7 edge back in March. After two months, it started showing some screen color issues with annoying purple stripes all over the screen and the cellphone itself feels hot. I had to set the brightness to the maximum to temporarily ""avoid"" screen issues. And what's worse, the screen just died completely and I can't even turn off this phone since the screen is no longer functioning. Now I am trying to return this failed S7 edge and get my money back and never gonna buy any Samsung product again."
exccelent product
Has lots of cool and helpful features. Performance is very good. I highly recommend purchase if you are considering switching or upgrading
I received the wrong power plug. Did not get the US type.
This phone is absolutely stellar. Amazing screen even in direct sunlight. Battery life is tremendous. The ONLY drawback is this version isn't compatible with Samsung Pay at this time in the US.
"Awesome phone and amazing camera I mean this is the camera to beat. S7 edge due to the bigger battery almost has 2 day battery life, touch wiz has been heavily refined, but nova is still the way to go. Design is slick and still a head turner and feels great in the hand. Number 1 of the top 3 Android phones , and I highly recommend only con is no Samsung Pay for international."
I'm satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy s7 EdgeIt's very good product beautiful. I truly loved.
"Buying this unlocked international Galaxy S7 Edge had me worried at first, it was in Spanish when I turned it on. You need to have your sim card inserted before you can change the language! After getting it to English I am totally please with it. I had the Galaxy S5, and compared to that phone, this Galaxy S7 Edge is AMAZING! There are so my new and cool features. I took 4 days to receive the phone. I'm totally satisfied with this purchase."
Love it. Exynos processor is much faster than us versionAlso I travel a lot to Mexico so be able to switch SIM cards is awesome
Excellent vendor. Product is exact as described. All Perfect.Recommend to all.
Great service. No issues .
Excelente
It's ok 52%
"Good phone, works great on AT&T. They can't block WiFi Hotspot with this phone. I have unlimited data grandfathered but was never able to use my phone as a Hotspot with an AT&T phone. Only drawback is it comes with a European wall plug."
I was completely satisfied!
My seller Wlaphones did all as promised. They sent the phone in 2 days and had no problem no change the delivery address since I moved and totally forgot to make the change. 5 stars to the seller and 5 stars to the phone. I've had it for around 2 weeks and had no problems to activate it in TMobile. Amazing phone and great seller
"Is not a Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE.(SM-G935F) .It's a regular Galaxy S7 (SM-G930F)..accidental mistake or intentional error , But it's not the product that I payed for..I'am realy furious ..Be Carefully .."
The seller was good. They send me a sealed box. The problem is the phone. I bought it to use in Argentina. When I opened the phone in Argentina there was a pink line on the screen. It's a full pixel dead line across the screen. Y search on internet and it is a common problem with the edge phones and the solution is a new module/screen. There is no guaranty for me here.
"This phone is absolutely amazing. I could go on about the class leading camera, the all-day battery life, the amazing screen, the unquestionably useful Always On Display. That's probably not the most impressive thing about this phone though. Think about an iPhone 6/6S/7 Plus. Now think of the most annoying problem with that phone. If you're like me then the most annoying problem is undoubtedly the ENORMOUS bezels on the side of the phone. For those of us who want a bigger screen (because it usually means more features/a better viewing experience) the iPhone is damn near impossible to hold in the hand because after the screen ends, there is a huge swath of space on the sides that add several critical millimeters to the width of the phone. Not with this phone. The curved display not only looks amazing, but serves to give the phone a very compact footprint for the 5.5"" screen you are getting.That being said, there are things I don't like. Samsung still needs to make their software more stable and less energy inefficient. The longevity is more a virtue of the large battery than the software. Additionally the software can sometimes have funny quirks. Nothing too bad, but just things that are a little weird or slow sometimes.I also recommend that you buy a case for this phone. More than anything else on the market it's a work of art and you'll want to preserve it. I personally recommend this: Spigen Thin Fit Galaxy S7 Edge Case with SF Coated Non Slip Matte Surface for Excellent Grip for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 2016 - Black. This case is thin and almost feels like it isn't there. It'll make your phone easier to grip and give you piece of mind while you're out all day with it."
Received the phone and it was cracked
"Don't buy anything from this seller/company. I bought a Samsung Galaxy s7 edge, not even 2 months after the cell phone stopped working, Plus they don't accept returns."
Pretty nice phone. it looks great. it is very fast and i love the camera.
This is the best phone I've ever had
Perfect
good
A great phone with a lot of apps that can apply for fun or work. High speed and great connection.
This phone came newest. And many people asked where i bought it?. I most say what i see. Thanks again.
"Arrived on time and in perfect condition works perfect and very fast loading file and surfing,one of the best phones I have brought and will recommend to everyone"

"Stunning display. Impressive 5.5 quad -HD screen shows crisp colors from various angles. Best screen on any smart phone.Beautiful curved design is an eye-candy.Camera is not 12 megapixels and superior to S6 and iPhone. Auto-focus is also has great speed leaving others in dust.Large 3600mAh battery is like having a phone + battery case without actually having the thick battery case. Hard to kill that battery in a day.Always on mode constantly displays notifications without the need to unlock the phone.Water resistant. IP68 rated which means the phone can be totally submerged in water up to 1mt deep and 30 minutes.Micro SD expandable memoryAgain, the battery is so good."
"I have just one word for this phone: AMAZING!! Much better than Iphone, in my opinion."
Excelente!!!!
"I bought this phone in August for my wife, the phone has been a hassle from the get go. Two weeks after purchase the volume button started moving erratically on its own. Then the phone started hanging and will not reset by just switching off the phone, we need to hold the power button and the decrease volume button at the same time. The frequency of hanging just kept increasing, even after the doing a factory reset the phone continued to deteriorate. I am highly disappointed! I would have returned the phone if the window had not elapsed. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"
"Excelente Product!! No objections, just get a antislip case cause is like silk"
Its a bad experiencie because I Lost almost $120
Good item.
FRAUD!!!... Phone is from Brazil and does not work.
ok
ok
good every thing
"great deal, great seller!"
it is an excellent cellphone
Beautiful phone
Good phone.
"Great phone and camera. Seems to slow as you load on more apps, but still faster than my S5"
"I was very surprise when I turn on the phone it seems that it was not new because it was already configured, I dont see the first time I turn on de Willkommen screen. It was configures in Dubai. The phone work, Also de charger is very sttrange , very big and with rare conectors.......The phone is very good but Im conserned that you send me something used whe I paid the full price."
"Great phone, though can be very buggy at times."
The phone is solid but I can't stand the edges. I ended up going back to the Note 5
"It seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves, who break the phone's box seal, open the box, and unlock the phones themselves (note that Samsung says ""do not accept if seal is broken""). Hence, technically, most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new. I bought a lot of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phones from Amazon, and most (not all) had the seal broken.On the phone itself, interestingly, the S7 Edge feels lighter than the S7 (even though it is 3% heavier ... maybe because the weight is distributed differently). The bigger screen is good for people with vision issues, but the resolution is the same as with the S7. The edges are highly annoying, making one touch them by mistake constantly. Furthermore, the edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case. I do not like this phone. I love the regular S7."
I received a wrong version...
The best Phone
"I'm so upset the phone keeps freezing and it just jumps from one app to the next without me selecting anything. Sometimes it don't allow me to restart it or turn it off. It also restart by itself sometimes, I'm very disappointed having me thinking if it's a refurbished phone."
"Waaaaay better than my iPhone. Can't say enough good things about it so I'll leave it at this: if you don't have one, you're missing out."
Excelente
feels too bulky I'm glad I bought a new iPhone 7 much slimmer and miles ahead in voice quality
Love my phone Samsung is a boss
The charger comes with the UK Plug. Would have been nice to know it before buying it.
I cannot make video call
Excellent!!!!!!
Todo ok..!!
Excellent cellphone. Battery is amazing.
"I received this phone yesterday and instantly fell in love with it. I have owned several Galaxy phones (s3, s4, s4 active, and s5). So far I love it! It came sealed in the original box. I cannot use the charger adapter that came with it, but I expected that as it's an international version.I picked the gold color, it looks and feels elegant and sleek. I love the interface, the phone itself is super fast. The phone has a big, beautifully bright screen. I am still getting used to its size. The fingerprint scanner is noticeably better than that of the gs5. Both cameras take amazing pictures.I am one of those people that are constantly on their phones during most of the day. It has an excellent battery life and charges very fast.I did read a couple reviews where people complained about the phone slipping out of their hands. I have used an Otterbox Symmetry Series case since I took it out of the box and have not had that problem at all.My only complaint about this phone is that it does not have an IR blaster, but I can live with that.I will update my review in the future if anything changes.UPDATE:I have been using this phone for about a month now and it is still just as amazing as when I took it out of the box. It still has amazing battery life. I have a Pocket Juice power bank that I was using around noon every day with my Gs5 but I have not used it at all with this phone. It usually still has 15% after about 12 hours of use.I have not had any lagging or random restarts like I did with my Gs5. The phone is still amazingly fast and responsive.I have slightly tested the waterproofing of this phone. The fingerprint scanner does not work well when wet, but the touch screen is still responsive.I have a Otterbox Symmetry Series case that I use with this phone and I have noticed that it causes the Zagg Dry screen protector to bubble up around the edges (I would like to state that I did NOT allow the protector 24 hours to ""cure"" after applying before putting the case back on, so that could be the reason.) I have heard that with the edges it is hard to find a case/screen protector combination that doesn't cause bubbling at the edges.Overall I would definitely recommend this phone."
Perfect
"I received the package open, the wall charger inside the package it was for U.K, I expected to receive the US connector. the phone recently it was completely dead I need to did a procedure to re start it. For these reasons I was no satisfied with my purchase."
The phone is working well but the chargers adapter can't be used in the US. I would like if the company can send me a charger to use to charge my phone.. Apart from that all is good about the phone. Does it have a warranty tho ? If it does how long?
I have 3 mons and no work more.
I am not able switch on my mobile since today morning. The last used yesterday night and when I woke up in morning I found my mobile was totally dead even not charging also.Kindly help me to find the solution.
"Works excellent on Cricket. No issues, this is a truly unlocked phone. Had purchased a so called unlocked phone from a retail store that calls it self the Best to Buy at. They even had displayed signs saying ""Free to choose"". Except after paying more then $800 I found out freedom came after paying another $300 over a 6 month period, to Ole Ma-Bell. Then they would provide me an unlock code for my ""unlocked"" phone.If you're looking for a unlocked that's really, buy it here."
I got this item yesterday.. But it looks great!!
It doesn't work .. and I send it back to Amazon and I am waiting to give my money back .
"The charger adapter was not in the box, I can not use the phone."
"I loved the phone. Firstly it works, there is no problem with the phone. It is fast and sharp. Screen is big and colorful. I love the curve part. With normal use (some social media, little talk, some music stream with bluetooth earphone it's battery goes for 2 days. If I play Pokemon, it goes 1.5 days"
best way of online shopping for people who work on cruise ships
Works great worth the buy
all perfect!
Great phone. Improved battery life. Awesome camera.
"Problems with my product samsung galaxy s7 edge:1. Samsung galaxy s7 edge Box was not sealed2. It was labelled International version at the bottom of the box and also labelled American sim only at the back of the box3. After starting the device, I noticed the bottom right corner of the screen had a little blacked out portion on the display itself. (maybe damaged item was sent)4. When I opened the unsealed box, content was not arranged as it should be ideally. (It was messed up)"
Amazing smartphone. It's highly recommended
Broken phone!!!!!
Because the wife likes it
Good
"I love my S7 edge, the only thing is sometimes gets too hot."
I am not happy with the phone because according to the phone description your website the phone should have two slot sin your website the phone should have two slot for SIM card as was described for the middle east and African version. So I send the form back home which is Ethiopia for my sister so she will be able to use it for school but now she can't use it for school. And I bought that phone for $660 and I have no use for it now thanks
As described
"Marvellous phone! Just as expected. Arrived some days late but I'm sure it was because the company ships all their orders in an specific date and that's why they offer several days or hours to order for the Prime Shipping. The first day I used it, It overheated A LOT, I was worried because I didn't want to return it after all the days I waited and the complication of waiting again for another one. But i searched the problem up and its normal for it to occur the first day, its setting up anyways, first day of startup. Until now, I've had it for about 2 months. The S7 Edge, exceeds expectations. Runs games smoothly and fast! The ability to switch apps and for them to stiill be active is amazing. Great phone, I'll update this soon with more information on how I'm doing with it."
"I really liked this phone, also I am so glad about amazon's services thank you for everything."
all according to expectations
Came with scratches on the lower right hand corner. Everything else was in good shape.
the phone just lasted two weeks then starts going freeze and doesnt turn on again
"Everything is perfect with the device but one of the sides of the box was ripped. Plus they gave me an adapter that works for England, not the US version."
the best phone out there
"excellent product smartphone came as I wait for Maracaibo, Venezuela 100% recommended"
OK
so good <3
All good
Excelente!!!
After 2 months the display look weird! Colors everywhere.
Good price
I love it... :-)
"The phone is great, works well with at&t services"
Liked it awesome.....
Excellente
the best
Shipped in a reasonable time frame and worked with my carrier (t-mobile). First time I have ever bought a phone outside my carrier so I did a lot of research and I am well pleased with the result. The processor (this one has the international processor--much faster than the US processor) and battery life is wonderful!!! Right now it's 5:04pm and it's been off the charger & heavy use since 7am and I have 60% battery!
i only had my phone for about 3 weeks and the screen start jumping rapidly
The phone is good except the phone's charger is not the US version.
very good quality Amazon good job
"Telephone edge Dandy Yes, it's a phone in the top extravaganza I've loved phone I am very happy very, very strong"
"Love the phone I bought (black onyx). Works very well. Great camera, great screen sensitvity and charges quickly. The only downside is that I have to use a converter with the fast charging cord. I find it cumbersome although it works well. I guess it was made for a British market."
"It's everything i hoped for in a cellphone. It is fast, beautiful,though the camara doesn't really take great pictures in low light or dark spaces. Eveything else is just perfect!"
You can't go wrong this phone is awesome....
the machine.very good
"Two weeks after I bought it, it got problem. :(it got wet and failing the microphone, I hated it because I was told that the water proof was really good. Take care with SAMSUNG."
I love the phone. Seller ships on time. Brand new unopened box.
"Love this phone, only problem i had was i didn't know you needed a nano SIM card. I had a regular SIM card and it cost me another $20 to go to get. But other than that it's going to be great I love it and I think I might have it for a really long time, unless Samsung comes out with something way better than this."
Best phone ever.
Item came as described.
Like
It's an awesome phone for sure.
Love it.
Excellent mobile phone. Beautiful design with the best camera !
I use this phone good
Soon after purchase the screen became pixilated and flickers and eventually went black. Samsung claims they don't cover the international LATAM phones under their product warranty even though it was purchased in the USA for international travel purposes.
"Do not buy this phone it does not work and is NOT unlocked as advertised. This is false advertising and wasted my time and money. I now cannot call my family while deployed into war, wasted my time."
I received the phone in sealed box. It was in good working order. It still is. Everything is fine.
all good
i love this phone and am enjoying it!!!
perfect
"This phone is by far one of the best on the market. After reading the reviews left by some of the buyers, there seems to be some confusion on what seller to buy it from. My phone, which is real, and came factory sealed, was bought from ""The Coos"". However, to my understanding, there is no one out there making fake edge phones. The phone is just too complex to duplicate. What might be happening is the phones could possibly be getting damaged during the shipping process. The phone is glass, so if the shipper isn't packaging it correctly, it could absolutely take on damage. This is why I recommend, that if you are planning on buying this phone from amazon, make sure amazon is the one fulfilling the order. I have had no problems at all when I order from a third party that allows amazon to fulfill the order. Also, it doesn't hurt to review the customer reviews on the actual seller as well.As far as the phone itself goes, it works perfectly. All the specs pretty much define what to expect from the phone. It's got the best screen in the world and the best camera. The glass finish makes it beautiful, but it's fingerprint prone and and extremely slippery. Other than that, I have no complaints."
The phone is great all the features are amazing there is now a front light for along self-esteem just like how snap chat does it the Camera quality is awesome. The battery life is great and it charges quicklyBut within less than a week phone haven't dropped or anything I saw 4 grey translucent lines come upon the screen sometimes when you turn up the brightness it goes away but who wants to have the brightness so high?? I'm trying to find out how I can get this fixed
Very Happy with my item it was exactly as described and it arrived on time.
the best one in the store
thank you for my phone
Only head the phone a few days and already it has glitches. The volume will randomly turn itself back on from vibrate without anyone even touching the device and also the power button sometimes woulnt work
Great phone but charger was not original everything else it great
Phone that I have received was broken. Whenever I take a picture under any kind of artificial light I get bright yellow/orange spot at the center which also shows up in pictures.
Optimo!
At first I gave this 5 stars. Now I'm giving it one because it has a vertical pink line going up and down the phone. I spent a crap load of money on this phone for it to be doing this. I will give it 5 stars again once the problem is fixed or phone is replaced
A+
"I have been a Samsung Galaxy owner before, but decided to make a change to a phone that started good then got worst.I used to own the s3 and I'm glad I made a comeback to Samsung once again.The international version seems to be faster and have a longer battery life than the last phone I used to own. With one charge it'll last me all day, while on the other phone I had to recharged it when I got home from work.The graphics are amazing and I haven't had any glitches or problems with the phone so far.I did buy a screen protector and phone case since I seem to break phones quite easy.The screen itself seems to be scratch resistant.As for water resistant I can't say anything since I haven't used my phone in the water, I don't feel confident enough to drop my phone in the water or have it in the shower.This is so far the best phone I've owned, it does not heat up as bad as my other phone and it has an elegant view."
 I Thought that the galaxy S7 edge is the best product but after just one week of use (it was not a massive use because it was my secondary phone) a black lines appeared on the screen when I change the brightness I reset the phone but I noticed it's a hardware issue not a software problem and I found myself unable to do anything because I am leaving the country
Amazing!!!
"Great camera, decent battery life, waterproof!"
I got the phone and it was on and were fingerprinted is this normal? or not?
Blazing fast and beautiful phone. Excellent camera
i can not use samsung pay and video calling facility in it.
Nice
It is working perfectly. I love it
very great phone i was abit worried when i ordered this but after recieving it using it i love it allot just some buyers know that with some carriers when u goto activate ur signal may just say 4g or lte or 4glte depends on where u r and ur carrier as for mine i have at&t usa and my signal says 4g i was hoping it would say 4glte maybe over time it will i dunno
good
Best cell phone ever. *****
"It's an awesome phone. The edge takes a little getting used to, but that's a small issue. Great camera, awesome sound in music and talking. Love the anti-glare. Seriously no glare from any angle. Even the headphones were great. Clear, crisp sounds. I bought the unlocked version and it works perfectly. Just had to insert the sim card and that was it. (And that's in the Caribbean) so for those customers wandering, it's definitely an Unlocked International Version. Highly recommended."
"I purchased it for my GF, she loves it...It was in GSM so the day I received it I went to Walmart purchased a Mano sim for 9.99 Go Phone. POP it in and it works great she still playing with it and learning the many feature"
This phone is a mess. I used to love the first months but now I don't have any signal( I tried 3 conpanies already) and is heaing up and freezing and starting the phone. Also my fingerprins don't work. I can't believe amazon is selling fake phones or damaged phones
Awesome smartphone!!! Too fast and it looks like the same as announced !! I received on time. Thanks!
The reception that I receive with this phone is HORRIBLE! I don't know how to fix this issue but i promise others will run into this problem. I'm not sure if it's because it's not optimized correctly for t mobile or what. It sucks honestly.
"Phone is great! It was a huge upgrade for me going from the Samsung Galaxy S5 to the S7 Edge. :) No problems as of yet, phone runs smooth and fast! I love the camera! The seller (Wireless Everything) was even kind enough to even include a US wall adapter along with the order."
Excellent product all on time
as advertised and totally pleased with
Excellent!!!!!
Everything was ok as far as I know. I got this for a gift and had it sent on to them so I would not receive it.
Great phone unloked. Work very good in US and Europe. Great customer service from amazon after a problem with the delivery
"very good product and perfect delivery, thanks"
Excelent phone
"Bought this specifically because I wanted the Exynos processor instead of the Snapdragon and so that I can root if I wanted to. I'm on T-Mobile US and did my research to ensure that my bands are supported - which they all are except for some 3G. I bought this phone from a seller named 'lifeline###' and the box the phone came in had the factory seal. As another reviewer pointed out, my phone originated from the United Arab Emirates so this came with a non-US friendly charge adapter and the manual appears to be in English & Arabic. In any case, the phone is great working order and I was able to just pop in my T-Mobile SIM card with no configuration needed, nor a visit to the T-Mobile store!I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 so all I had was the regular charging block which doesn't support the fast charge. I went ahead and purchased the Aukey QC 3.0 block and I'm fast charging away!"
Be aware that black translucent lines may appear across the screen even after very short period of usage.
"It has meet my expectations, thank you however the battery life can be improved a little more."
"Best phone I've had yet. really happy with it. Very fast, the battery lasts very long and the camera is really really good. Whenever my friends take pictures they always ask for my phone because the camera is just so much better. If you're an adroid person and you're looking for your flagship phone, don't look any further.If you're in the USA, this comes with a default European adapter plug and US converter."
The phone meets all expectations. It's excellent. I Love It.
"The build quality is excellent, on par with Apples external build quality.This devices edge design makes looking at the screen much more interesting, and less ""flat"". It is similar to looking into a slight bubble. The buttons are very tactile, and the fingerprint sensor and it's controlling software work well.Samsung's TouchWiz implementation on top of Android 6.0.1 raises no real complaint from me. I do not use their ""Edge UI"", but it can be fully disabled easily."
every thing is ok
definitely unlocked and works well in my country.
Excelent smartphone
The speaker does not work. The headset is not heard for calls. Does not emit any sounds. Try updating firmware. Clean the terminal. But unfortunately it is the hard. Is a beautiful and expensive paperweight. It has no international guarantee. The phone is from the Saudi Arabia region.
"It was perfect for a month until just yesterday, it suddenly crashed while I was using it and will no longer properly boot up. Going to try calling Samsung for servicing tomorrow, hopefully the warranty works.**Edit update 11/19: Samsung said that their US warranty does not cover for international versions and fixing it myself did not work. Luckily, I called Amazon and they very kindly allowed me to return the phone for a full refund! If you are facing the same problem you might want to try this asap!"
Good value for the money
It's good so far
The rear glass is broken. The headphone does not work. I guess that's why it's cheap.
"Phone arrived OK it functioned fine. After one month problems started. Phone constantly reboots. Some times gets stuck, no hard reset is possible, only need to wait for battery to die. Next thing phone died altogether. There is no warranty from the shipper TheCoos !!!. Now I am stuck with this brick and do not know how to fix it. I did not expect such a poor performance from a supposedly top of the line phone. Maybe this ""International version"" is fishy. I strongly advise: Do not buy this phone!!!."
The product start to have problems with the screen and the vendor dosen't have any to say about that
"I like the S7 Edge a lot. Very sold phone, good battery life. Nice looks."
Works great! excelent product!
Great!
Product doesn't have US warranty! Came with a scratch when I unboxed the phone and 10 days later my display started flickering.
Very good product
It malfunction
Everything was perfect. Customers services is a also great if you need help with something .
I love it
Great Phone!
Despite I ve bought a latam cell phone version The charger is not for any country in this region. Hope when I arrive to my country the phone set works perfectly ....
For the price you can't beat it. However the international phones do not support wifi calling nor does it support android pay. So it's up to you if those are deal breakers to you
I love the phone when it was working. Since it is an unlocked device no one seems to want to take responsibility for repairing it under warranty. I am having the famous grey line problem which seems to be a pretty wide spread problem with this phone.Samsung customer service is terrible. I have spent hours trying to find a way to get my device serviced and keep getting told to call someone else or someone will call me back in 24 to 48 hours and no one ever calls back.For Samsung customer service alone I will not buy another Samsung device ever again.
Good phone and it lasted for 5 weeks!!
This is my 2nd Samsung Galaxy S7 as the privious one was stolen. I love every aspect of this phone. It worth every penny.
Excelent phone very recomended seller
Works perfectly and the product came nicely packed.
Perfect. Great phone
I already have this phone for about a month and I haven't found any problem with it. Is legit and works perfectly.
"I wanted to write this review mainly to share information on this product. The product reached well before said time. It was delivered in good condition. The phone is as equivalent to buying a samsung galaxy s7 edge in a carrier store.Only disadvantage that I have come across so far is - The samsung pay app doesn't work in this phone.So if you are interested in Samsung pay, you should consider other options."
Phone is faulty screen stopped working after 1month
Excelent product.
"I am very satisfied with S7 Edge, I have the international version. Fast charging, great photos and great screen."
Everything is good
Very good quality
Great
"Till now is very good, and I have it for 2 weeks. But I hope to be the same because I have a friend who had the same phone and her display was buried after one month and I heard that other people had the same problem"
cool
"I would like to report the following: 3 days ago after charged my cell phone it had a burst and broke the glass of Case Battery Door Cover the back, after the fact the battery does not hold more charge. Now I would like to know what will happen ?!!!"
Don't buy these phones because you will have to stand the loss like I did. I purchase this phone in July and when I returned home and start using the phone overheated and burnt the screen. I payee 400 USD to get it fixed and it still haven't fix properly and all Amazon did was sent me $150 for my troubles! I had a loss. I'm out of the country and not returning until May. My business with Amazon with Electronics are DONE! Even after fix there are two shades of light in the phone and the technician said it's a software problem. He said I should contact Samsung. I just gave up on everything.
Very nice.
"Shipment arrived on time. So far, the best phone I've owned. Takes some effort to locate and update the device firmware."
"The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a awesome phone, worth the price! Grateful to have compared to other smartphones."
Very good
Everything was ok the phone is great :)
The best smartphone.I feel like a baby with new toy.
"Perfect size, amazing front camera and super fast phone..."
I received my phone on time and it's working perfect
Why does this phone have different features than my friends like this one say about device and my friends says about phone and MA you more stuff too but why
Amazing and beautiful!
"Best phone available today. Stunning 4K display, amazing camera and water proof....whaaaaatttttttt. Awesome."
Best phone ever! Happy and satisfied!
really nice phone
Good.. thanks...
"This is a great phone! screen, design, camera, you won't have complains. Except that there are options almost as good as that for a lot less money."
except samsung pay everything is good
"Buyers Be AwareThis shipper has send me 'FAKE"" Samsung cell phone.Everything looks almost similar to the original Samsung but many features do not work especially the Camera makes terrible low pixel pictures, no screen stability, always lagging behind and many more.... buyers be aware.Although I send it back immediately, I am still working to get my money back."
just what I was looking for
Best phone I've ever bought!
It was to expensive. And it does not get fully charged in 4 hours and it does not stay charged more than 12 hours. I like my LG flex better.
Excellent product!!!!
It was good
I LIKE PHONE PROBABLY MORE THAN ANY I HAD SO FAR ESPECIALLY CAMERA AND IT FUNCTIONS GOOD SO FAR'
Delivery came on time. Definitely pleased with my new phone!
Nice
Got it on time and everything was perfect. The charger was european so it came with an adapter. Works perfect.
Awsome!
Great item still testing durability and exploring features.
every new phone has firsttime open setting.but it already opened and has 7% power left when I got it .even when I Check the background.there has some apps .one of them is setting.I use to worked in a store(someone like bestbuy) in china.i was the manager of 3C(cell phone .camera )department.so I know what we did to the returned phones.but to renew a phone.at least clear the data and make sure no one will know.please do things professional.
"Awesome phone, great build quality, very slim, i had a samsung galaxy S3 before, and that phone last like 8 months, hate it samsung for their build quality, since then i've been trying another brands, so i decided to give samsung another try and guess what i love this phone, my only complain is the battery it doesn't last long like the iphone 6s plus, it has one of the best AMOLED screen i have ever seen the color are very bright and clear so if you want a phone buy this one you'll not regret it."
"Really is an amazing phone well worth the upgrade,"
The phone is really good
"It is slippery. But i mean really really slippery. It is so slippery that it can be used to grease a pan. I heard that in the dictionary they added a picture of the Samsung S7 in the word slippery definition. It is THE MOST slippery thing i have ever seen in my entire life. You couldn't hold it with your hands even if you had frog fingers, because it is so slippery. If you don't mind a slippery phone, go ahead, but i must warn you.. it is very slippery. Very very slippery.(Ps. I tried to add a photo of something very slippery so you can relate but couldn't find, cause all i can think of a slippery thing is Samsung S7)"
"excellent product, highly recommendedClosed box wine"
Samsung> Iphone
Love Samsung phone and tablets
This phone is really fast and there is no lag for multitasking.
It is working fine just like the seller descrived
This phone is absolutely amazing. Everyday I learn something new about it. Amazing
I was nervous about purchasing an international version of this phone but I'm happy I did. I actually owned a US AT&T version prior to this model and I can confirm the following after several days of use and testing:1) The International version has the faster Exynos 8890 vs Snapdragon 820.2) Battery life appears to be better than the Snapdragon 820 US model.3) No problems with AT&T LTE 4G.4) No AT&T bloatware!So far I highly recommend it!
Excelente producto
Me enamore del teléfono
Good
The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge got here on time and in great conditions it works great.
I'm sure you've seen tons of reviews about the phone so if you are going to get it this is a good place to do so.
"on time ,no problem ."
"Great phone, very happy"
Good
"The phone it is ok.. but the charger dont work it for me, i am from latino america and the charger have an entrance different.. now i am looking for a charger in my country.. i paid 700$ and i can not charge my smartphone......"
"Greatest phone ever.I have used it for 9 days already and it's awesome.My only complaint is the lack of good glass screen protectors.First off the camera,it's awesome,although it's pretty similar to the S6.I wish they stayed at 16mp as it was 16:9 but otherwise, its great.It even has a wider angle,when zooming it had a tiny bit better quality than the S6 and autofocus is extremely fast.Low light was obviously insaneThe battery, this was one of my main concern with my S6 and the S7E battery is very good.The first days which tend to be pretty bad for battery life, where surprisingly good.I even had to drain it's battery sometimes.But to be honest it perfomed a bit worse than I expected, i mean, it's waaay better than the S6,but as a student I thought it would last me a bit more.I read articles on people saying they used their phone heavily and ended the day at 11:30 with 20 percent battery life(that was using bluetooth,nfc,location and wifi/lte on as they said) and in my experience, I have finished days with 35% battery from 7am to 11pm but only using either wifi or mobile data,no bluetooth or nfc,no location services on.So I think mi phone's battery is stabilizing yet(if someone can tell me if im right say it please!).As a student, I don't use my phone for long periods from 7 to 4pm.Maybe 15 min intervals or 30 minutes using gallery for photos,what really surprised me is that battery drained pretty fast sometimes and sometimes it almost didn't drain,which is weird.That's why I think it may be normal for the fist weeks(again,correct me if i'm wrong)BTW, I don't use powersaving,which I did on the s6 alwaysPower wise, It's an extremely powerful phone which can manage literally anything,and there's no lag with power saving on or off.There's not much to say.The phone is a bit bigger than the s6 and s6 edge.I strongly recommend it"
Cause it has everything.
Sleek phone. Looks great! A good size not too large. Fits well in my hand. Great camera and sound quality. Battery lasts for a day.
Phone seems refurbished. Google programs skip and it seems like it has a lapse from time to time. Slower than I expected and because of this I am afraid to test to see if it's waterproof as its supposeductive to be.
Exactly as promised. Was worried I wouldn't be able to activate it with an American carrier (since the included documentation indicated that might be a problem as opposed to requiring a European carrier to activate it first) but it worked fine.
Why the phone doesnt say galaxy s7 edge on the back ?
I love it.... it works get on metro pcs. I live in NYC. No complaints
"I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935F in Black from this product page a week ago.A lot of people have asked questions about this particular international version so I'll answer some of those first. For starters, the one I got was the english edition for the Saudi Arabia market (see attached photos, the guides came in english and arabic). From what I can tell, the phone is the same as any other international edition but with different preinstalled apps. Mine came with a SA region specific app ""Shaid"" (seems to be a YouTube-esque app in arabic) that I uninstalled and WhatsApp. Other than that the only remaining bloatware was stock Samsung apps (no carrier apps, thank god), the only other thing I noticed that may be region specific is the S Planner app has a ""Hijri dates adjustment"" setting. Lastly this version ships with a non-us wall charger (aside from the regular stock accessories) shown in my review images. Mine also came with an adapter for use within the U.S., I have tried it and can confirm that it works with fast charging.This phone also uses a different chipset (manufactured by Samsung, called Exynos 8890) than the U.S. version. Reviews I read noted that the phone was actually optimized for this chipset w/ better performance and battery life than the U.S. Qualcomm counterpart (Google it). In the U.S. version the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip is used to support Verizon and Sprint customers whereas this version only supports GSM carriers.To preface the review of the actual use of the phone, I have owned the following devices and used them each as a daily driver for at least a months time: Samsung Galaxy S4 GPE, Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, HTC One M8 GPE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P. The Galaxy S7 Edge has been the most delightful experience of the bunch. I won't go into great detail here but the camera is phenomenal and launches faster than any other phone I've owned w/ a double tap of the home button. The camera's auto focus is super fast and I feel like I'm able to get a capture a lot of moments that my previous phones were too slow to shoot. It's also nice to be able to change the quick launch apps on the lock screen, I have the dialer and snapchat as mine.Continuing a theme of high performance this phone is incredibly fast despite powering a QHD resolution screen. Apps are surprisingly quick to load and multitasking is a breeze (I even found some use in the Samsung's split screen feature). The fingerprint scanner is on par with apple devices (and nexus 6p/5x) although because of it's non-circular shape I find that I place my finger the wrong way more often. The battery is the best of any device I've used as a daily driver, I've been able to get through days of heavy usage like today (unplugged from charger at 5:45am, now at 25% at 9:03pm).The screen is BEAUTIFUL. Not only is it easy to read even in direct sunlight (something I have seen other devices struggle with) but the colors are vibrant and the screen is huge without making the phone too big or bulky. Perfect for watching YouTube videos and browsing instagram.Lastly a few notes if you buy this phone:- If you're not a fan of the stock Samsung launcher you can get the Google Now launcher from the Play Store, it's the same one used on Nexus devices and feels smoother than Samsung's launcher.- This time around Samsung decided to give you bigger icons which drove me nuts, search for ""Get more on your Galaxy S7, S6 or Note 5 screen with hidden DPI scaling settings"" from Android authority to get a 5th column on the home screen and smaller UI elements.- ""Edge functionality"" is just okay. The feature feels a bit less than polished because of the weak offerings in the Samsung app store - I have it turned off.Edit 4/8/2016: sorry about the quality of the photos of the actual phone - they were shot with the wide angle lens of my GoPro whereas the other images were shot with the S7 Edge.Edit 4/10/2016: added some higher quality images from my new camera.Update 5/9/2016: I've been using the phone as a daily driver for over a month now. I'm still impressed by the overall gfx smoothness, how fast apps load, and camera performance.Update 7/25/2016: still in love with this phone. I'm honestly not sure what would compel me to purchase a new phone at this point.. I also rooted the phone and changed the emojis to the iOS 9 set with the Emoji Switcher app from the play store. No more guessing when messaging my iOS friends =)A lot of commenters have asked which seller I purchased mine from: Wireless Everything."
Great phone. Got it today and it's absolutely beautiful. Can't wait to give it to my boyfriend as a birthday present he will love it. So far IL very please and I'm sure I won't regret the purchase!
You must buy this phone!!!! Much better than iPhone!!!!
Very good item and fast shipping
"Although my shipping experience was a bit troublesome, the product itself its amazing! I knew it was international version but was not expecting a UK plug, best part is I get almost not bloatware"
"awesome phone, excellent camera, i bought 3 of these phones"
This is literally my first review because I never had a product that deserved my time...until I got this phone! It's absolutely the most amazing phone I have ever seen!Couldn't be happier!
too much advertisement and getting hot too past.
Perfect
I hope this one can use a long time.....
"Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G935F- Black OynxAbsolutely disappointing, the charging port was hurt at 4 days, and today after 10 days has begun to smoke and smell of burning. I'll have to repair the ""new"" cell. I'm angry and I'll never buy in this shop."
"It is perfect this phone . First time that I bought a phone online and I had a very good experience . It's in very good condition and I got the phone next day . The only thing it's that on the back doesn't say ""galaxy s7 edge"""
"Bought this phone and have had it for several weeks. Absolutely love it ! fast and smooth, battery life is amazing. I'm with AT&T and if you can sacrifice wifi calling... this is the way to go. although it doesn't have all the LTE bands I have absolutely no trouble. My job requires me to travel often and I get great coverage everywhere, even in the gulf of mexico. I am now an exynos s7 edge fan boy."
Excelente Producto. Vendedor Recomendable
"if u have tmobile by this with confidence I was very hesitant at first people saying this is designed for a different region, until i remembered that I am middle eastern and the phone I previously bought was designed for middle east and worked great here in the US until I decided to upgrade, the only difference you will notice is the pre installed apps for the region and that chargers may have different inputs because it was designed for Europe or middle east, my seller that i bought from solved the charger issue by providing a complementary connectorgo for it, be brave for once."
"Everything went well, excelent product. Hope do not explode!"
i love my galaxy s7 i have no words
perfect
so much better than getting the ATT version of the phone no bloat ware and you can teather with out having to buy the extra service from ATT
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CJU9BBM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
Legit Company. The phone is brand new no issues... & these guys are fast!!!
Great
I have it for a about a year and works great!
"Screen failed in under 4 months. No warranty, no repairs. You are paying for a future $600 brick."
Works with American AT&T no problems. The 4g lte symbol does not show up but I know I get the speeds. Very happy that I purchased it
"Love this phone so far. It has been reliable and works as advertised. This is the international version, which means certain apps, like Samsung Pay, don't work. It's only come up a couple of times, but it is annoying. Not a negative on the phone, it's clear that this is the case. Just wanted to spread awareness."
"do not buy a international phone some features will not work,,,,,,,,, This seller is slow on returns"
Hi thereI ordered this samsung galaxy s7 on jun 17 nd everything was very very great until 2 week ago i just realized that in the screen there is one pixel wrong. Is almost imperseptible but if you focus on this pixel you can see how s*** it looks like
Techno master always send products that after 2 weeks you start seeing the defects. It has happened twice in less than 2 months.
"DO NOT TRUST this product on this seller.I bought TWO WEEKS AGO and the device showed:1.) problems with fingerprint lock. Basically this feature adds 30 seconds of waiting time before using your phone, since it consistenly does not work, and it locks your phone after 3 tries.2.) Phone would consistenly freeze (once a day) with the watch on. The only solution is restaring the phone. and the freezed clock is an extra because it made me lose a few meetings.3.) ""unbreakle glass"" screen broke after ONE WEEK OF USE, in my FRONT pocket, without never even even falling on the flor. it was ONE SINGLE coin that made the damage."
"My husband and I bought these as an upgrade from our previous Galaxy S5s. I got the rose gold and he got the black one. The rose gold color wasn't as rosy as I thought it would be, it's more of a champagne color. The black one looks very sophisticated and elegant. I must say that I was not a fan of Samsung borrowing Apple's idea of no memory storage and making it difficult to put the sim card in but it was an easy fix with being able to send all of my extra photos to my Samsung account. Upon arrival, the packaging makes sure the product is not harmed whatsoever (lots and lots of bubble wrap). In all honesty I was afraid the phone was not going to hold up very long because of the glass edge and because I'm prone to dropping my phone...a lot. However even with out a case it has held up quite well. The photo quality of the front and rear camera is amazing, definitely a step (or two) up from the S5. We decided to buy on amazon because the price listed was $200-$300 cheaper than buying in stores, plus free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime. All in all I would highly reccommend this phone if you're a Samsung lover like myself."
LED screen started to flash in and out and show a blue screen after 3 weeks. Battery is already over heating after 3 weeks of use. Battery life sucks.
Inserted AT&T and works absolutely fine.Great phone.
"I bought the cellphone as gift for my brother, and to honest, he's really happy.Service was really good, I'm really satisfied about the product and also the serviceGood job!"
I love it
CAME WITH A WRONG CHARGER FOR EUROPE VERSION
You have background colors in it but the second one that I received it worked perfect
Outstanding smartphone. I have been using a IPhone 6s and a Galaxy S6 Edge before. This smartphone beats both.
"Just what I want, a perfect gift for my wife"
"Love it, it came with usb adaptor and 110v adaptor!got an European version wich is great for me"
Great phone! My first Samsung and plan to continue with this brand!
"As soon as i got this i have yet to put it down, SUPER FAST, AMAZING SCREEN, its the dream phone i have been waiting for. Easy to transfer my data to the new phone, very thing and light, when i first held it i was like ""omg this thing is super light"" like i would drop it forgetting about the weight of it lol Only thing i was ""eh"" on about getting it was the seal was detached from the box(wasn't broken but the adhesive was rubbed off from shipping/warehouse), and the branding that usually says ""S7 Edge"" on the back is not on this model which i think is a good thing but made me feel for about an hour ""man i got a fake"" but it was not the case at all, it felt like the real deal. I checked the settings and the software is super snappy and easy to use, in the ""about phone"" section of settings it does say model number and the phone type as what it was advertised.PRO:~Amazing screen~Great build~Wireless Charging/Water Resistant(i have tried the water resistance and i say it works, had residue from the stickers and so i ran under tap water and cleaned that right off)(i have yet to try wireless charging yet)NEUTRAL:~Battery(it seems great but at the same time not so great. I woke up at 7am with 100% and then by 8:45am its at 85% so i still great but i feel by the end of the night ill have 10% left or less. I am a heavy user when it comes to my phone)CON:~Charger it comes with is foreign(my seller gave me an adapter with my phone, but i don't know if that's every purchase so be well aware it MAY NOT come with an American Adapter)As far as i can tell that's about it so far, i will update my review when and if anything changes. Yet to test wireless charging but plan on picking one up soon and will add an edit to this."
"It is good phone, came on time. It is not fake. Everything was good but my messanger is not working properly."
The phones features are great. The only thing is that... I've had the phone for a week and not dropped it once. Today the phone cracked when I dropped it... I was sitting on the floor when it slipped from my hand less than a foot up and the entire screen cracked. This material that it's made from is terribly fragile.
Great!
Vera Good!
Goodd nice
"Phone is very sleek. it looks nice and it has a lot of things going for it.- Water Resistance- Amazing and Fast Camera- amazing screen- pretty fast charging- Good Battery- Fast Charging- Fingerprint Scannerand others.but for all of its pro's it has a few Big Faults. The big one for me was how hot the phone got. For just using google Maps, to even playing Pokemon go for a little bit in the park, the phone got so hot I could barely hold on to it. I couldn't even imagine using this with a case on it might melt. Then when the phone detects that it gets too hot then it makes that big beautiful display lowers it brightness to where I can not see in the daylight anymore. I am having a lot of issue with it in the Sun.I have heard of these issues with other Samsung phones. Maybe its just the ones with this certain processor, I am unsure if the SnapDragon ones have this issues but the reason I got the international is that it could go to any carrier more or less and I could get the added performance of the Exynos Processor. Turns out it was a bad idea and the phone got so unreasonably hot that I could barely hold on to it. The phone also got noticeably slower as it got hotter. Probably because the processor was limiting itself.Maybe this could be fixed with a software update but I think this is more of a hardware issue. Maybe I just got unlucky and got a defective phone as i don't see many other people mentioning these problems. I do not blame Samsung or have any bad feelings for them. I just got unlucky with my device and will be returning it to Amazon."
"5 stars to the phone, 0 stars to ATT. ATT was not able to get 4G connection going on this phone. Blamed hardware. IMEI checked good. Phone would show 4G AP but could not establish data connection with it. Was only working with 3G AP at 3G speed.The thing that did the trick was temporarily inserting SIM card from friend's phone that was connecting 4G. My phone made 4G connection right away. Means hardware is good. Put back my own SIM card. Voila, phone still connects at 4G!"
"nice product, easy to use, but both front and back crack very easily."
Everything perfect
Great product! Got the Italian version. Doesn't seem to be any different. Good battery life.
"Works perfect with the Brazilians (GSM) carriers. Nice and solid finishing. Noticeable improvement from version S6 (I have one). I wish it was for two SIMs, but's ok."
"EDIT: So after owning this for a few months, I'm dropping the rating solely because of the Edge touch screen. The fact is that I find it very annoying to use. The side of your hand touches it really easily, and it it makes typing or playing games on the phone very frustrating. The edge apps themselves are very few and far between and not that useful either. It's a pity since the phone itself is great, runs programs well, has great visuals and camera but actually using the thing is just frustrating. I'd suggest getting just the S7 to save yourself some money and comfort.The phone that arrived is the genuine article and works great--I'm thrilled with how well the battery and fast charging works even when playing Pokemon Go all the time. Also, I have T-Mobile and the phone works perfectly fine.However, even though the app is on your phone, the international model is not compatible with Samsung Pay. If you want that you need to get the American version of the phone. I wish I'd known this, but to me it was worth the savings in price and you can still use Android Pay. But I didn't realize this before buying it and I would have liked to have known."
"After a few hours of use,unexpectly turned off,then it begins lagging and acting weird,just talk to amazon for help, they didn't help me because it was bought through a freight forwarder.i really feel like a wasted my savings for nothing"
The cellphone is not unlocked like the wibsite describes. The cwllphone is locked by T-Mobile carrier
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Switched from an iPhone 5 and so glad I did. This is an amazing phone!
Good products
Excellent
Love it
The charger which was sent with the phone does not apply to the USA setting.it is really giving me a hard time to charge and I also expected the phone to come with a memory card but it does not have one.
Everything as should be... would buy from them again
nice phone very good
"Amazing phone. Bought it to use it in Argentina, 4G works perfectly. Packaging was inmaculate."
"Love Love Love this phone. The screen is crisper than anything I have seen, it's fast and beautiful. Life is good"
All excellent
very good
"Did not come with charger adapter as expected, otherwise its PERFECT"
Fast delivery. Product awesome.
The mother board came broken and I cant do anything
"It's a great phone, i recomend!"
Cost-effective.Product delivered exactly as advertised.
No stars if I could I got a GS7 no edge
"I'm really pleased with the product,Met my expectations and the information provided by the seller is correct as the photos.I really recommend the product because for me it was very useful.I hope my comments were helpful"
I dislike this product is not working good
"Great display, good battery life"
"Beautiful cell phone, light weight, thin, good screen size, lots of functions. As soon I inserted the SIM card it gat connected to my provider. Its working fine"
"International phones can not be repaired in the US. Despite the cost of this phone, it is a piece of crap. Samsung customer support will not help. LCD problem in less than 3 months with minimal use, and NO damage. Not even a scratch on the phone, yet it is almost useless. There are smart phones selling for $10.00. This one cost me $850.00 and did not last long. BUYER BEWARE."
"Excellent! Great design, smart, camera is wonderful even in the night time with bad light. Sensitive screen, fast internet... no problem. Thank you.Delivery in time."
ok
thanks very good
Perfect!!
All that I expected
"I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 and am absolutely Amazed by this phone. It can go for over two days before charging. It has none of the typical bloatware. It's supposedly waterproof but I don't plan on testing that on purpose. It's painful to have to pay the full price up front but it's worth it to not be at the mercy of your cell phone provider. I will never buy a locked cell phone from a cell phone provider again. I'm glad they brought back the SD memory slot, but I wish it had a removable battery. Other than that, I think the Galaxy S7 is one of the best phones on the market at this time."
"Excellent phone, I just wish it had all the band's of the phones so you can switch to any carrier like the nexus phones, and Samsung pay wish it had but I know because it's international it couldn't, but we'll made. :)"
Have had the phone for a month and just love it.
"Samsung has made an absolutely Spectacular Phone with the Galaxy S7 Edge. Perfect Size; fits and feels well in the hand. Easy to use, the touch screen is brilliant, easy to see even outdoors, clear and crisp and the special edge feature of the screen makes this the most beautiful cell phone ever made. And that is just the beginning.The Camera in the New Galaxy S7 rivals many of the cameras you can buy for hundreds and hundreds of dollars! You can take Incredible photos in low light, great videos, even HD Video recording and much more. Removable Storage has come back with the Galaxy S7 and now you can insert micro SD cards with as much as 200GB of storage.You pay for high quality and the Galaxy 7 isn't cheap. But it is well worth it. BUY The New Galaxy S7 - you won't be disappointed."
"I'm very happy with this phone, fast hasn't fail and I had it for a week, I will update if things change but overall it's a winner"
"I already did wrote a awesome review for this phone, I even inspired myself like I was writing a poem and I gave 4 star to the phone but after 1 month and some days of use it started giving me problems, the phone restarts randomly out of nowhere, that has happened like 5 times and the then today I was just playing music and the lockscreen didn't work and the whole screen went black and none of the buttons were working to turn on the screen so I had it to do a massive restart, good thing it didn't erased all my stuff. I don't know if it has warranty or not but I'll be happy if I get my $850 back that I worked so hard."
Good job! I found my item on time!!
Perfect phone except for the fact I cannot connect to 4GLTE in Texas on AT&T. I may try out TMobile and see if that network will connect @ 4GLTE. Anyone with suggestions on how to connect to AT&T 4GLTE please let me know. I have used the APN settings from AT&T website to no avail. I would give it 5 stars if not for the LTE issue. It will connect as 4G only NOT 4GLTE (San Antonio Texas)
"this model doesn't support samsung pay!!before you buy, you should know it!!"
I sm really happy with the product and the service provided
"The delivery of the phone was before time and the phone works flawlessly.. Do not worry about anything, you will never regret buying this device"
"I bought the S7 Edge and received it a few weeks ago. It is an excellent phone, however, it did freeze and had to be replaced. There are software flaws in the S7. Wireless Everything provided prompt service and I would definitely buy from them again."
It did meet my expection and I am so sati
product is as expected! had to return and the return pricess was also smooth
Decent phone no problems but at that price a warranty would of gave it 5 stars
"Be wary of the Edge phones. My husband dropped his from about 1 foot and the screen shattered. I have heard about this happening with other Samsung Edge products, but I have had so many phones and not once have the screens cracked so I thought I would be fine. I was wrong. I should have listened to others."
same as the one I would have gotten from AT&T except unlocked. The only difference is that samsung pay won't work yet.
The unit tells me IT IS NOT registered On NETWORK and does not allow me to make calls.
"This phone is AMAZING. The display is gorgeous, it takes some time to get used but it totally worth it. This phone works great in argentina's network and i am having a pretty rough time trying to kill the battery it just doesn't want to give up."
all ok
Powerful tool!
Exelent Phone!
Great phone
Thanks amazing
"the phones is a very nice one , works great ..."
Excelent
awesomw...!
"Bought this for my teen, he loves it!"
"I ordered this phone which was branded as an original but it was completely fake. Not only was the Samsung brand not on the back of the phone, but also the features of the phone event the writing was different from the original phone."
Everything great. Bought from wirelessplace.
Yes. sick lookin phone. I saw couple of feedback that says fake phone or something fishy. In my case it was all good. And about the phone it's great! Nothing much added to s7 accept hardware improvement. Touch unlock is much much better then s6 generation. Great bettary life something aspect from Samsung. Not dissopointed at all.
"Excellent phone. Everything arrived well to Venezuela, except the travel charger that does not work"
"I bought this right after my iPhone decided to stop working which was this past Saturday and I'm not disappointed. It's definitely bigger than the iPhone 6 so sometimes it feels like I can't hold it right..The battery life is amazing, great camera - Def different than a iPhone camera, great screen size and colorI have Cricket Wireless as my network and it's working great,BTW that company has the same signal as AT&T, but sometimes I have to resend texts several times, it's gotten annoying. Idk if that's a phone thing or provider issue?My last android was the galaxy S3 now to the S7 Edge, incredible improvement"
Excelent
One of the best phones out there.
I like the camera.
"DO NOT BUY! They will NOT SUPPORT YOU! DO NOT BUY! Purchased on June 10th 2016. 3 months later, the PHONE BRICKS. No damage, no spill, never even touched water, in a case its whole life. Just stops working, going on, nothing. Got extremely hot for about 2 hours for no reason after it went dead, but then nothing after that. Called Samsung (had registered the device and everything), first they collected info on the phone and said they will call back in 24 hours. Waited a week, no call. Called back and they straight up told me they will not help because Samsung America does not help Samsung Anywhere-else. They connected Amazon, and Amazon just dropped the phone on me in mid sentence with no call back! (And no number I can call them back). Return policy ends July 31st ONE MONTH+ after the order!!Basically if you buy this phone from here you will not be supported if anything goes wrong.... and my phone BRICKED with neither Samsung, Amazon or TheCoos stepping up to the plate to support or repair. I wonder why Apple has a loyal fanbase? *Dripping with Sarcasm*DO NOT BUY! They will NOT SUPPORT YOU! DO NOT BUY!"
"I bought this phone for my dad and he is in love with it. It has fast-charging and all the high end specs that you could ask for in a top tier device. I don't know much about it, besides the fact that there hasn't been any issues thus far. It's got some interesting features and is a pleasure to use, I can tell you that much!"
Love this phone. Super fast. Screen is nice and big. Loaded with a bunch of great features.I connected it with cricket. Only 55 a month get great signal (cricket uses att towers)So i get nice fast connection with a low monthly cellphone bill.
"Love this phone. I upgraded from a galaxy s5 and it was well worth it. Aside from its design, what I love the most about this phone is its battery life. I can easily go a whole day, with moderate use of course, without having to charge the phone. The screen size is also perfect for my taste, not too big or too small. Strongly recommend."
"I bought this phone one week ago... I have no idea why there're some black stripes on my screen. When I increase the light, it's smaller..."
"I by the phone , and the screen have black point in corner left side..is damage.."
When I purchased this phone I was under the impression that it was unlocked. Now I find that it only works with at&the This is a scam . This phone only works on the AT&T network. It will not work on Verizon. Do not be fooled. This phone is not unlocked.
"Awesome device, water resistant, pretty fast. It's going to work with a lot of carrier all over the world. Beautiful external case made of glass. Samsung did it pretty good this time, for sure. The product came with an adapter for if you want to use it in the US. Another important feature is that you can still use this in the US and have the 4G compatibility, the only thing that you are going to miss it is the processor as the other US version has a better processor using the snapdragon 820. However, the Samsung exynos is pretty powerful too, so you probably wont feel the difference."
I received my package with no phone just a charger and headphones. Complete rip off!
Best phone ever it was easy to activate in my mobile service.
"This phone is the best i've ever had so far! If you have the cash and looking for a new phone, do not hesitate on buying it!"
The best phone ever. Great camera. Buy it.
phone would not work unless plugged into the charger and its got an internal battery so i had to return it brand new phone
Work with metropcs YEAH
It's awesome. Using it now to type this
It's perfect!!
It is easy usage.
It met my expectations
"The best phone you will ever have, can handle many applications in background and it still responds as expected, zero lags and the curved screen is the best.The phone came with the AC adaptor as it's for Africa but I had no problems at all, the quick charge is just amazing and the battery lasts the whole day (5am to 11pm) with no need to additional battery charges.Go for the gold version it's the most classy one. Some photos that I took they look so real. Enjoy!"
"Original, reliable."
"I really like the phone, but nobody mentioned that Samsung Pay does not work with this, the international version - I had to call Samsung Support to find that out.. disappointed and send it back for that reason..."
"I live in the UK, but had this delivered to a friend's address while I completed a road trip from Miami to San Francisco. The delivered product was well packaged and was originally intended for the Middle East market. A big bonus for me is that the supplied charger uses a UK-style 3-pin plug. While hardly a big deal as I, like most people, have the world's supply of USB power adapters. Considering that this purchase has saved me quite a bit of cash over outright purchase in the UK, I'm very happy.Powering up the phone for the first time shows a single application for the intended market which was deleted as I have no use for it. I've owned Android phones previously, but have been using an iPhone 6 Plus for the last year. I've since fallen out of love with iOS as it's just too inflexible and is becoming somewhat childish in terms of interface. Samsung's implementation of the Android platform is smooth, highly-polished and commendable. It's not as fast as the pure product in the Nexus lineup, but does not suffer as all as a result.The octacore processor in the non-US model is just pure sweeping power. It's a good thing that the battery is a hefty 3500mAh unit or it wouldn't last the day. That said, if you're the kind of user who has multiple applications running all day long - and I'm among that userbase - this phone will take it all in its stride and not break a sweat. The screen is absolutely beautiful without being too highly saturated, the cameras (both front and back) are immensely capable and the return of expandable storage through cheap and capacious micro-SD cards is very welcome.Physically, the phone is svelte, lightweight and sits in the hand beautifully. Even without a case, there's no feeling that you'll drop it at any moment. One of the finest physical features is the waterproofing that doesn't require that you slap chunks of rubber into the ports to maintain its integrity. no more panics when you're caught in that torrential downpour about your phone suffering a premature demise.I haven't tried any of the included accessories such as the micro-USB cable, charger or earbuds as I already have very high quality 3rd-party versions. From the look of them, they appear to be reasonable quality.For anyone in the US who's concerned about losing out on network connectivity by using a phone from an overseas market, rest assured. I used a SIM card linked to T-Mobile's 4G network and had absolutely no issue anywhere with obtaining a good strong 4G signal. The Exynos processor in the US market model, while likely perfectly adequate, will almost certainly be that touch slower than the beast in the overseas market product.If you're like me, fear running out of power when you're away out all day and carry a power bank, know that the quick charge 2 feature has this from about 5% to fully charged in around an hour. The genuine Samsung quick charge puck may be slower to re-add the juice, but it's utterly convenient when you're a tired and then don't have to worry about not quite plugging the phone in to charge.If you're seeking to buy a phone without the burden of a contract, do yourself a big favour: Save some money, get this model, use one of the probably five or six wall chargers you already have and enjoy this incredible handset. It may be coming from outside of the US, but it's delivered quickly and I have no doubt whatsoever that it'll be loved every bit as I love mine. This is the best phone I've ever had, and the added bonus of saving on the cost of purchasing outright through Best Buy, etc is the icing on an already very delicious cake."
Got horizontal lines on display within few days of usage. Unable to return it because the timeline to return has expired :(
perfect
excellent
"The phone is amazing! the screen is simply the best on the market right now. I read different comments about unreliable sellers selling fake or refurbished phones. I was lucky I bought mine from seller, theCoos. Got the phone new as described without problem."
"AWESOME phone. Came prepackaged, sealed, Turned on in English. There was an Arabic file of some sort - which I deleted. The model number matches correctly. No issues or problems getting it going and activated. Took it to my local AT&T store for the sim card and it took a little extra time and a couple of restarts, but after that everything is working great. I'm still learning some of the little tricks that come with it. The cell coverage shows ""4G"", not ""4GLTE"". I don't know the difference. The ATT guy said some would say it was better, LOL. I have no idea but, whatever. There are a few pre-installed samsung/google things. Smart Switch uploaded many things, but some things like ringtones were not backed up. I had to go looking for them. In the process, I also discovered some new ones. Battery is doing just fine and lasts as expected. It has it's own Samsung factory warranty - 1 year. I haven't been able to find any way to tell for sure if this is the snapdragon or xynos processor, but as I stated earlier, the model number matches, so....my first experience with an unlocked phone purchase on Amazon has gone well, IMHO. Thus far."
"The Samsung Galaxy S7 is perhaps the best mobile device right now. With so much technology, it has boosted the Galaxy S series. It is very easy to use and it makes you feel as if you don't have a mobile, instead you have so much more."
do not have samsung pay for international version. which is the main reason why I select samsung.
Device works fine and is fully unlocked and shipped in two days. All around good service
I'm kind of afraid that I wasted my money buying this considering all of the negative reviewsi just read. I surely hope that it works out when I receive it
"Great looks, camera, speedy.Overall great device."
was not for me
Amazing phone
Absolutely love the phone. Best purhase I ever made!
"The screen, the edge, pictures are GORGEOUS! What's not to love!"
Like very much.
"I'm really liking this phone. To be fair this is my first flagship phone. I'm coming from a cheap Nokia Lumia 520 but figured for once I'd splurge and see what all the fuss is about on these top tier phones.The first thing I noticed is that the screen is absolutely beautiful. I couldn't get over how clear and lifelike everything looked. Also being able to actually see my phone's screen in the sun was a definite plus haha. OLED is just an awesome technology and I can't wait until TV manufacturers tweak the picture processing a bit. Just a great display.I haven't run benchmarks or anything but everything on the phone is very snappy. Going into the camera, opening/switching apps, playing games, watching movies, etc. all ran smoothly. I didn't notice any warmth or the phone running hot but that probably due to using a case. The call quality was fine and overall I'm really enjoying it.On the down side, I think the phone's a little awkward to hold or picking up from a flat surface. I got this case Galaxy S7 Edge Case, SUPCASE Full-body Rugged Holster Case WITHOUT Built-in Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (2016 Release), Unicorn Beetle PRO Series - Retail Package (Black/Black) and the rubber edges made a world of difference. It's no longer slippery and easy to pick up off of a flat surface. Nothing worse than paying for a phone like this only to drop it while trying to set it up!The only thing I'm hoping is that the battery lasts quite a long time. Not having easy access to it is kind of a bummer. As I just dropped nearly $750 on it and I don't upgrade phones every year I'm hoping it lasts awhile. As much as I really do like this phone I don't think I'll be spending this much on a phone again. The purchase was more to quell my curiosity about these high end phones so I can check that off my bucket list hahaI purchased the phone from Wireless Everything and it arrived brand new in a sealed box with all new components. I popped my SIM card in and I was off to the races. I never purchased an international phone so was a bit nervous but everything went extremely well. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative I would suggest the OnePlus3 or ZTE Axon 7. Very similar specs for 400 smackaroos."
Love it's very nice looking and the camera is outstanding.
"The phone keep freezing ,"
Love my new phone takes amazing pictures battery life is long lasting and works perfectly with straight talk 😊
Love this phone. Very nice and beautiful. Fully unlocked to all networks and 32gb is plenty of space. Curve screen looks great but functionality not overly used.
Pay a great price for an excellent product. A++++
Is a great smartphone... my gift for Christmas... the cellphone was delivered without problem. 100% recomended
"The screen cracked completly with a fall on the ground when I was going up in a car. So it was not a big distance or fall. I used to have the S6 edge, and definitly had more falls and from much higher distances, and this never happened before. This was the first fall, and it breaked a lot. And after the minutes where passing, it where cracking more and more. I'm not living in the USA, so I had to fix the screen in my country, and the cost of a new screen was around 300 dollars. More than half of what the phone cost me. I can understand that if the phone fell from my pocket it's my fault, but what I don't understand is how fragile it is. Obviously, besides that, it's a great phone, but the fall was very light and the damage very strong."
"Nice looking phone, bought on april/2016, almost 7 months later my screen shows a dead pixel, it's suppossed that i have a one year international warranty, i contacted samsumg.com and the told me ""that the warranty does not apply if you buy on an online store"".For an expensive unit, i'm pretty dissapointed.Still wainting for seller to respond my email."
"This phone is good, somewhat slippery but good, but I have problem with Samsung. I ordered it from US to US and yet my phone can be repaired only in AFRICA? As it is unlocked International phone IMEI number does not exist in Samsung US database, where it is listed? Answer can be found only in the box, which can be read only after receiving the order: Africa!?!I believed that phone bought in US should be serviced in US. Period.It is verified original, made in Vietnam, and was working good until small fall resulted in flickering screen. Now I want to service it but Samsung holds this phone is not in database and suggest to send it to Nigeria, or Ghana...That is just wrong from a serious company. Therefore one star."
Im a die hard galaxy fan but im not made at the phone its self but its hardware 4 months after i got this phone i got this screen flickering glitch. And a week later the screen dosnt work i love the phone but my parents arent getting me a galacy anytime soon
Using it everyday and still rocking.
Do not buy this piece of garbage. If you break it it cost $400 to repai it. It broke the first time I dropped it.I called Samsung and they said our technicians can't currently repair Galaxy S7 Edge phones.Back to iPhone
bad
Great product won't regret buying.
good excelent.
Amazing one
"Sooo ummm I got it the next day after ordering it, which is crazy. I done my personal testing and I'm really Impressed makes my note 1 feel like a brick.... edited part: I dropped it in a huge puddle today sat for a good 7 mins under water, pulled it out and still works great"
Excellent
good
"Came in perfectly fine, works fine. Is sexy. Yes."
Love the phone I was a little scare at first because some of the paper instructions were in arabic but I put the phone to work without trouble manage to change the settings to english and spanish .It is a great phone charge really fast the adapter came for middle east kind of current but they were kind and send a travel adapter for it works great so far I am really happy thank you.
The phone was working pretty awesome then it just crashed and wouldn't turn on. Did all the troubleshooting I could and it still wouldn't turn on. So I had to return item.
"Excellent product, it cover al my expectations and more. The seller has a great attention."
Over heating
This is a fantastic device. Works well in my country and costs $350 less than in my country. I know you won't believe it but it is a sad fact.
Great phone! Everything I use so far is good.Unblocked version it's so better than cell comapnies version because you save a lot of time non uninstalling app that you'll never use
The screen broke the first time I tried to use it.
A complete garbage! ! ! Don't buy it! You will lose a big amount of money! . After 2 month the screen became complete black. I contacted the seller and he said that the warranty with them was just for one month but he told me that I had one year of warranty with Samsung. .... I tried to contact to Samsung warranty in United States and in my country (Argentina ) and they both said that the year of warranty was only with the country where the phone was manufactured (Vietnam. ....seriously? ??)Well I wasted almost uss 700 in a phone that after 2 months stopped working and the only solution that I have gotten was to fly to Vietnam or spend uss 330 more tax to fix it in a no official cellphone center of technical support
I love my new cel phone.Fer

"Everything is good. Would be amazing, if my microphone worked though. Supermely annoying I can't make calls. Would have gotten a 5 star but because of this problem UT gets one"

"Amazing phone, super fast and terrific camera"
"Incredible Smartphone. Every single detail you must want ina phone, it comes with it."
It's Samsung! :)
Very good
There is a mark on screen from the day it came and there is lot of heating issue with phone
"The phone was unlocked but was formerly a Sprint serviced phone. It turned out to be a stolen product and Sprint was able to disable the voice and messaging functions. However Amazon did back it up with a refund for me. Next, I bought the same phone but used, not refurbished, with a different service provider, thru Amazon. It has my carrier on it (t-mobile) and have had no issues with it. It is also unlocked.Great camera. Except it gets fuzzy at max zoom."
Excelente. Recomendamos
I Bought this phone as a gift for my sister and brother in Europe. The phones arrived in brand new condition with seal and in a timely manner. They absolutely love the Samsung over their previous phones( iPhone6). They have stated the phone is absolutely amazing and beautiful. It works wonderfully for their purpose and the quality is good. Watching videos look great and the photo quality is gorgeous. They are happy with the expansive memory.
Satisfied.
Way better than buying carrier branded and bloated version. Awesome phone!
Amazing phone
package was sent with the warranty seal opened however the seller clarified the reason of that. Phone works fine.My previous phone was a Samsung 5 but this one is amazing.
It is very good
"Love the phone so far, haven't really used it yet. But the charger is not compatible with the outlets here. Really disappointed about that, because now I have to either purchase another or find an adapter. Is there anywhere in the description that stated this was the type of charger used?"
Best mobile ever
"This item was received on April 21. On May 14, I filed a request to return the item since there are problems. Runs hot. Locks up and does not reset. The supplier, Worldwide Distributors responded on May 16, stating that I needed to contact Samsung Tech Support directly, providing no contact information for Samsung. Mind you, this is within the 30 day return window, but they never mentioned this in their response. I have contacted both them and Samsung and ALL i get is a run around. I cannot use the phone and I am not asking for my money back, I need a working phone."
Great phone
"Great device with so much to offer. I recommend buying from the seller, ""Mobiles International LLC."" They sent a new and reliable device and honored a warranty for a defective product on Samsung's behalf. :)"
Worldwide Distributors great job.
Great. Fabolous. I love it.
amazing phone and the service from this guys is absolutely exceptional
This phone what can I say .... it's fast nice feel to it .... no lag... Samsung will be samsung they will only get better and better...
I've been using this phone for around a month now and I got hacked 3 times! 3 times!
A really good buy....am impressed with my purchase. Will buy again.
Perfect
Good
Love this phone and lack of AT&T bloatware. Wished Samsung Pay worked with the 935F or at least the firmware/locality I received.
"Got the s7 edge, was working really good. Then suddenly something happened with the screen, the whole right side of the screen is blinking and all the colors look really bad, i wanna return it and get a new one, i think that if after 37 days that happens i deserve to get a new one. Edit :Screen stopped working completely, Samsung USA not taking responsibility, amazon don't take responsibility, don't buy from the seller"
This Is the best phone I ever have. It is a must buy
"I usually read reviews bedore ordering anything, and therefore I was very anxious while ordering the phone. Various users various experiences.But for me, i got a good deal on device. I got it whithin a week. And its a Latin American version with US wall charger.And so far device is performing as it should be.10/10"
Excellent Very thank you
Phone stop working in 3 months
"Hello, shipping has come to the House of my friend in Miami. I traveled the day November 15, that day I will know if you are all well. thank you."
"The seal was broken. The phone was completely fine, and it is the original phone. Other than that, all as is to be expected - great product!"
"Everything as expected, better than punctual. I missed that the charger was not compatible with 110w plug but it came with a converter."
It's an excellent phone very fest and he has an excellent reception. Also the battery is very very good doesn't run out but if you have small end it's hard with the hedge
"If I had the option of voting ""Zero"" stars I would. I bought my Galaxy S7 Edge and paid full price for it less than 7 months ago. Now the phone is presenting a hardware problem which was already acknowledged by Samsung that it is a factory problem, what means, they know it is their problem and that they are supposed to get it fixed or exchanged. However, because it is an ""Unlocked International Version"", no Samsung authorized service would even touch the phone. Not even if I am paying for the service. So, now I have a USD 800 paper weight worth nothing at all. I hope Samsung is reading this. I have been a Samsung Loyal customer since Galaxy S II and now I am dropping this ""Loyalty"" for a Windows Phone (yeah, Windows Phone. After wasting my money with a ""Samsung Flagship"", a windows Phone is all I could afford to buy). Thanks Samsung, you have made an (ex) customer really (un)happy !!!!!!"
"My boyfriend got this phone over the summer, and he actually likes it much better than his former iPhone. It comes with earbuds, a charging cable, and a very useful charging adaptor to accommodate different charging ports. I personally think it's too big, but I have small hands haha. Overall, a very reliable phone that works really well."
"phone is good, but the seller is a swindler"
"Good product, but a little defect. The home button make big noise when pressing it."
Thanks very good
Great product.... great seller
It said the phone was unlocked and I can't even use it with Verizon very upset
beautiful good
Perfecto
Good
beautiful and fast
"This phone is the best and has no problem, it works perfectly in Ecuador."
I am a bit concerned about the battery I was expecting it to last longer than it does
Great
"Although this phone was advertised as being unlocked, it would not connect to the AT&T network when we took it to get it activated. The AT&T employee told us that it was not unlocked or it would connect immediately. He even restarted it to double check. The Amazon representative who started the returns process gave us the name and phone number of the company that actually sold it. When we called that number, a Verizon automated service answered the phone. So my conclusion is that the phone must be locked to Verizon. My 15 year old son worked all summer and saved his money to buy this brand new phone on his own and took great pride in that fact. He is so disappointed."
Love it...100% original samsung edge7
Excelente!!!!!
Had the phone for 4 months. Suddenly no data. Contact seller and was told no warranty as its a unlocked phone. Load of crap
The Samsung Galaxy s7 edge is a great phone. It was easy to transfer my info from my old phone to the new one. Love the low-light camera. I'm really happy with my new phone.
Excelent Product is the best
Argentina ok!!! 😉
tons of bells and whistles.... very obnoxious if you have nerve damaged hands (screen and features constantly activating without consent!!)... several totally useless things you cant turn off or get rid of without rooting the phone.... as this product arrives with no US warranty.. you aren't voiding anything... that at least is a bonus! Several features arbitrarily reactivate despite having turned off etc....Samsung could have done a much better job with this model.
"Very fragile, broke to the first fall. No warranty."
Rather expensive but meet all your expectations
Increíble! Gracias!
Fantastic
I rate this as a 100 % not a fake fun everything is fully clean
"the phone was good, the packaging was terrible"
Do not like it very much
Great phone. I just love it
Nice seller and excellent product.
Good phone

Yes I loved the product
"I am extremely sad and angry, I received a USB cable instead of the cellphone, buyers beware"
Terrible can i return it?
Everything was perfect
i love it. i used my unlocked phone in Ecuador it worked fantastic.

"This phone is so much faster than the Galaxy S6 Edge I upgraded from. The biggest difference I noticed was the battery life lasts double what the last phone did. Plus, the screen is big. Can't go wrong with the Ultra HD resolution. The only problem I have with it is that it's the Italian version and won't let me use the Samsung Pay like my American S6 Edge did. Kind of a bummer, but we still live in a time where I have to lug my driver's license around, so my credit card might as well come along for the ride."
"I bought my phone in June. I live in Boston, MA where the weather has started to get cold now. I'm a commuter and tend to spend a lot of time outside, and I believe its been the change in temperature that has caused some intrusive, glitchy streaks to appear very boldly along my screen, which interupts my view of everything on my screen."
"I have just got the phone and I am very happy with the quality so far. Great camera, fast processing. Compatible with an AT&T Go Phone SIM card. I will update this review once I try inserting an international SIM card as well."
The best phone I ever owned... great stuff!
Arrived early!! I was a bit hesitant getting the new S7 on amazon with not many reviews but Amazon hasn't failed me yet so I took the plunge and ordered it. I tested it with the Genuine Galaxy app and its a genuine unlocked Samsung phone. It works with my phone provider (in Jamaica). I am so in love with the phone.Everything is working really good.
"This phone is definitely one of the fastest on the market at the moment. I have dropped it several times on hard floors, and there is no visible damage at all. I have also handled it with wet hands, and it still works flawlessly. Although, the fingerprint scanner doesn't get along with water drips. The edge screen is a great addition, and I have gotten use out of the news feature when the phone is locked. The battery life is great, since it lasts about a day with moderate to heavy use.Also, for those who are wondering, this model supports most LTE bands, and it is also supported by most GSM carriers. I use it with Metro PCS, and it works perfectly."
Awesome
Fast and great
"Is a beautiful design, I a m getting used to it still many apps and actions that I need to control"
excellent! everithing ok! GREAT
The best android phone Samsung has ever made.
The phone is perfect!!!

This phone is fantastic. That is all. Everything I can say has been said.
Great
"Till now is very good, and I have it for 2 weeks. But I hope to be the same because I have a friend who had the same phone and her display was buried after one month and I heard that other people had the same problem"
cool
"I would like to report the following: 3 days ago after charged my cell phone it had a burst and broke the glass of Case Battery Door Cover the back, after the fact the battery does not hold more charge. Now I would like to know what will happen ?!!!"
Don't buy these phones because you will have to stand the loss like I did. I purchase this phone in July and when I returned home and start using the phone overheated and burnt the screen. I payee 400 USD to get it fixed and it still haven't fix properly and all Amazon did was sent me $150 for my troubles! I had a loss. I'm out of the country and not returning until May. My business with Amazon with Electronics are DONE! Even after fix there are two shades of light in the phone and the technician said it's a software problem. He said I should contact Samsung. I just gave up on everything.
Very nice.
"Shipment arrived on time. So far, the best phone I've owned. Takes some effort to locate and update the device firmware."
"The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a awesome phone, worth the price! Grateful to have compared to other smartphones."
Best
"Amazing phone, super fast and terrific camera"
Amazing phone
Absolutely love the phone. Best purhase I ever made!
"The screen, the edge, pictures are GORGEOUS! What's not to love!"
Like very much.
"I'm really liking this phone. To be fair this is my first flagship phone. I'm coming from a cheap Nokia Lumia 520 but figured for once I'd splurge and see what all the fuss is about on these top tier phones.The first thing I noticed is that the screen is absolutely beautiful. I couldn't get over how clear and lifelike everything looked. Also being able to actually see my phone's screen in the sun was a definite plus haha. OLED is just an awesome technology and I can't wait until TV manufacturers tweak the picture processing a bit. Just a great display.I haven't run benchmarks or anything but everything on the phone is very snappy. Going into the camera, opening/switching apps, playing games, watching movies, etc. all ran smoothly. I didn't notice any warmth or the phone running hot but that probably due to using a case. The call quality was fine and overall I'm really enjoying it.On the down side, I think the phone's a little awkward to hold or picking up from a flat surface. I got this case Galaxy S7 Edge Case, SUPCASE Full-body Rugged Holster Case WITHOUT Built-in Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (2016 Release), Unicorn Beetle PRO Series - Retail Package (Black/Black) and the rubber edges made a world of difference. It's no longer slippery and easy to pick up off of a flat surface. Nothing worse than paying for a phone like this only to drop it while trying to set it up!The only thing I'm hoping is that the battery lasts quite a long time. Not having easy access to it is kind of a bummer. As I just dropped nearly $750 on it and I don't upgrade phones every year I'm hoping it lasts awhile. As much as I really do like this phone I don't think I'll be spending this much on a phone again. The purchase was more to quell my curiosity about these high end phones so I can check that off my bucket list hahaI purchased the phone from Wireless Everything and it arrived brand new in a sealed box with all new components. I popped my SIM card in and I was off to the races. I never purchased an international phone so was a bit nervous but everything went extremely well. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative I would suggest the OnePlus3 or ZTE Axon 7. Very similar specs for 400 smackaroos."
Love it's very nice looking and the camera is outstanding.
"The phone keep freezing ,"
Love my new phone takes amazing pictures battery life is long lasting and works perfectly with straight talk 😊
Switched from an iPhone 5 and so glad I did. This is an amazing phone!

The screen times out while I am using the phone. And my low light camera isn't functioning properly.
"Excellent product I love it. No regret for price paid, it really worth it."

Amazing phone from a hardworking seller. Thanks!
Ok
"Great looks, camera, speedy.Overall great device."

Fantastic
"Love it!!! its so beautiful, so fast!!! I love it love it love it!!!"
Works great
"Arrived in great shape, very fast setup, works great! I have used over 3 weeks and this is a fantastic device."
It à good phone
"Great phone, everything looks nice, thank you. I'll be testing it and let everybody know how it goes. But so far it's awesome.It's been a while now and in gotta say this phone is fantastic. I've had a galaxy phone since the G-S2 till this one and believe me, this one is by far the phone I've ever had. Yes it can improve for example, the back cover would be great in aluminum (kinda like iphone) it'll prevent from cracking in minor accidents. The speakers can always be louder I guess. Oh yeah I forgot, the battery... Omg is the best thing ever, thank you Samsung you did great."
I've had nothing but issues with this phone since I got it. I have apps randomly opening and closing on it's own. I've read online that it is due to the screen being too sensitive. I've been waiting for a update from Samsung on this matter but it seems like my phone was from Egypt and I have not received an update yet. Pretty much the phone has been unusable for me because I can't even type or navigate the phone without it closing me out of applications or opening up ones randomly. I am very disappointed in this. What are my options?
"It is a great phone overall. It is running exynos processor, which was made by samsung. The packaging also include the American plug adapter since the device was made for European country. It is unclocked and works well of tmobile. It should work with other services as well."
"Love my phone, but I wish they came out with a bigger internal memory. Can't store the downloaded Amazon Videos on the external memory. So I can only keep a few movies then delete them after watching it. I don't want to steam videos or it will eat my data, and I'm not at a Wi-Fi hotspot all the time. That so far is the downside. Also, my phone did freeze once, but I was able to hard boot it by holding down the power button and the volume up and down button at the same time for a few seconds."
"I'm not one who generally uses my phone. I'm a pay-as-you-go type of person. I use my phone for calls and texts. I see no need to pay extra for internet with the number of places with free wifi. My last phone was the Samsung Gravity, so this was a large step for me. For my needs, this phone is extremely oversized... with that being said, the display size makes it great for other things. I try to use my phone minimally. I use apps for the weather because I own a convertible and love the beach. I also chat with some friends using LINE. I was holding out for the 64GB version, but didn't see any availability for it and needed the phone for work... so I can download and read email... and chat using Lync/Skype.PROS- 12 MP camera for nice crisp pics.- excellent display for viewing photos and movies- extremely fast and smooth opening and switching apps. I notice no lag whatsoever.- expandable storage- battery can last me two daysCONS- size- easy to accidentally press button on sides- internal memory options for the U.S.- color choices by cell phone carrierIf there is one regret, it's that I wish I had bought the dual sim version just in case I wanted two carriers so I can maintain my grandfathered price plan and still pay separately for wifi should I ever need it."
perfect
excellent
"The phone is amazing! the screen is simply the best on the market right now. I read different comments about unreliable sellers selling fake or refurbished phones. I was lucky I bought mine from seller, theCoos. Got the phone new as described without problem."
"AWESOME phone. Came prepackaged, sealed, Turned on in English. There was an Arabic file of some sort - which I deleted. The model number matches correctly. No issues or problems getting it going and activated. Took it to my local AT&T store for the sim card and it took a little extra time and a couple of restarts, but after that everything is working great. I'm still learning some of the little tricks that come with it. The cell coverage shows ""4G"", not ""4GLTE"". I don't know the difference. The ATT guy said some would say it was better, LOL. I have no idea but, whatever. There are a few pre-installed samsung/google things. Smart Switch uploaded many things, but some things like ringtones were not backed up. I had to go looking for them. In the process, I also discovered some new ones. Battery is doing just fine and lasts as expected. It has it's own Samsung factory warranty - 1 year. I haven't been able to find any way to tell for sure if this is the snapdragon or xynos processor, but as I stated earlier, the model number matches, so....my first experience with an unlocked phone purchase on Amazon has gone well, IMHO. Thus far."
"The Samsung Galaxy S7 is perhaps the best mobile device right now. With so much technology, it has boosted the Galaxy S series. It is very easy to use and it makes you feel as if you don't have a mobile, instead you have so much more."
do not have samsung pay for international version. which is the main reason why I select samsung.
Device works fine and is fully unlocked and shipped in two days. All around good service
I'm kind of afraid that I wasted my money buying this considering all of the negative reviewsi just read. I surely hope that it works out when I receive it
"Good product, but a little defect. The home button make big noise when pressing it."
Thanks very good
Fantastic
I rate this as a 100 % not a fake fun everything is fully clean
"the phone was good, the packaging was terrible"
Do not like it very much
Great phone. I just love it
Nice seller and excellent product.
Good phone
Perfect
It's ok 52%
"Good phone, works great on AT&T. They can't block WiFi Hotspot with this phone. I have unlimited data grandfathered but was never able to use my phone as a Hotspot with an AT&T phone. Only drawback is it comes with a European wall plug."
I hope this one can use a long time.....
"Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G935F- Black OynxAbsolutely disappointing, the charging port was hurt at 4 days, and today after 10 days has begun to smoke and smell of burning. I'll have to repair the ""new"" cell. I'm angry and I'll never buy in this shop."
"It is perfect this phone . First time that I bought a phone online and I had a very good experience . It's in very good condition and I got the phone next day . The only thing it's that on the back doesn't say ""galaxy s7 edge"""
"Bought this phone and have had it for several weeks. Absolutely love it ! fast and smooth, battery life is amazing. I'm with AT&T and if you can sacrifice wifi calling... this is the way to go. although it doesn't have all the LTE bands I have absolutely no trouble. My job requires me to travel often and I get great coverage everywhere, even in the gulf of mexico. I am now an exynos s7 edge fan boy."
Excelente Producto. Vendedor Recomendable
"if u have tmobile by this with confidence I was very hesitant at first people saying this is designed for a different region, until i remembered that I am middle eastern and the phone I previously bought was designed for middle east and worked great here in the US until I decided to upgrade, the only difference you will notice is the pre installed apps for the region and that chargers may have different inputs because it was designed for Europe or middle east, my seller that i bought from solved the charger issue by providing a complementary connectorgo for it, be brave for once."
"Everything went well, excelent product. Hope do not explode!"
i love my galaxy s7 i have no words
Great
"I purchased this S7 edge back in March. After two months, it started showing some screen color issues with annoying purple stripes all over the screen and the cellphone itself feels hot. I had to set the brightness to the maximum to temporarily ""avoid"" screen issues. And what's worse, the screen just died completely and I can't even turn off this phone since the screen is no longer functioning. Now I am trying to return this failed S7 edge and get my money back and never gonna buy any Samsung product again."
Love the phone but the front glass cracked within the first month with no foreseeable way of having ii repaired for much less than the cost of a new phone.
Best phone I ever had. Period.
Love it
I love it. It's beautiful
I didn't even download one app and the phone started heating up to the point that I couldn't touch the sides of the phone. I reset it twice and the phone was leggy as if it was an s2. I'm getting another one and after that one doesn't work which it obviously won't seeing that this crappie one almost melted I'm reporting them as frauds.
Best phone ever u till the note 7
I love it
The cel phone came with a burned pixel that didnt fix... the rest was ok
The unit tells me IT IS NOT registered On NETWORK and does not allow me to make calls.
"This phone is AMAZING. The display is gorgeous, it takes some time to get used but it totally worth it. This phone works great in argentina's network and i am having a pretty rough time trying to kill the battery it just doesn't want to give up."
"i bought this as a gift, my girlfriend loved it. she had an iphone 5, and dindt want to use android.But now, 1 month later, she regrests not making the transition before.great phone. i had no problem using it on tmobile or cricket network."
Excelent
"Good afternoon, this team that bought them, I was wrong. Does not work well, hangs up every few minutes. I have to remove the chip from the line for it to work. And then I bought it was for that, to use my line. I do not want this, I got damaged, I want my money back."
I had to return this great phone since the edge is way too sensitive and activates apps every time I touched the phone. Go for the 7 and not the 7 edge.
"It started off with buying one for my husband. Then I started playing around with his phone and fell in love with it myself. Had to buy a new one for me as well. One thing though, double check that it comes with an adapter for American outlets. My hubby's did, but mine did not."
It's Amazing 1+AAAAA

"Two weeks after I bought it, it got problem. :(it got wet and failing the microphone, I hated it because I was told that the water proof was really good. Take care with SAMSUNG."
I love the phone. Seller ships on time. Brand new unopened box.
Awesome smartphone!!! Too fast and it looks like the same as announced !! I received on time. Thanks!
The reception that I receive with this phone is HORRIBLE! I don't know how to fix this issue but i promise others will run into this problem. I'm not sure if it's because it's not optimized correctly for t mobile or what. It sucks honestly.
"Phone is great! It was a huge upgrade for me going from the Samsung Galaxy S5 to the S7 Edge. :) No problems as of yet, phone runs smooth and fast! I love the camera! The seller (Wireless Everything) was even kind enough to even include a US wall adapter along with the order."
Excellent product all on time
as advertised and totally pleased with
Excellent!!!!!
Everything was ok as far as I know. I got this for a gift and had it sent on to them so I would not receive it.
Great phone unloked. Work very good in US and Europe. Great customer service from amazon after a problem with the delivery
Package was not damaged and I loved the box of the phone. Appearance mean everything and the seller passed with that.
"Great Phone, great price, recieved Phone on time as promised. Thank you."
The phone is working well but the chargers adapter can't be used in the US. I would like if the company can send me a charger to use to charge my phone.. Apart from that all is good about the phone. Does it have a warranty tho ? If it does how long?
I have 3 mons and no work more.
I am not able switch on my mobile since today morning. The last used yesterday night and when I woke up in morning I found my mobile was totally dead even not charging also.Kindly help me to find the solution.
"Works excellent on Cricket. No issues, this is a truly unlocked phone. Had purchased a so called unlocked phone from a retail store that calls it self the Best to Buy at. They even had displayed signs saying ""Free to choose"". Except after paying more then $800 I found out freedom came after paying another $300 over a 6 month period, to Ole Ma-Bell. Then they would provide me an unlock code for my ""unlocked"" phone.If you're looking for a unlocked that's really, buy it here."
I got this item yesterday.. But it looks great!!
It doesn't work .. and I send it back to Amazon and I am waiting to give my money back .
"The charger adapter was not in the box, I can not use the phone."
"I loved the phone. Firstly it works, there is no problem with the phone. It is fast and sharp. Screen is big and colorful. I love the curve part. With normal use (some social media, little talk, some music stream with bluetooth earphone it's battery goes for 2 days. If I play Pokemon, it goes 1.5 days"
Good phone and it lasted for 5 weeks!!
This is my 2nd Samsung Galaxy S7 as the privious one was stolen. I love every aspect of this phone. It worth every penny.

Perfect Phone. Recommend
pretty dopestill too much cash to drop on a phone without a removable battery.
"I like it, I love it"
"Amazing phone, don't know what to tell, one of the best in the world right now. The selller is very good, I ordered 2 of this.. and they are awesome..I tried it in water, battery is amazing. I am glad that I bought this one.. Thanks :)"
"I live in the UK, but had this delivered to a friend's address while I completed a road trip from Miami to San Francisco. The delivered product was well packaged and was originally intended for the Middle East market. A big bonus for me is that the supplied charger uses a UK-style 3-pin plug. While hardly a big deal as I, like most people, have the world's supply of USB power adapters. Considering that this purchase has saved me quite a bit of cash over outright purchase in the UK, I'm very happy.Powering up the phone for the first time shows a single application for the intended market which was deleted as I have no use for it. I've owned Android phones previously, but have been using an iPhone 6 Plus for the last year. I've since fallen out of love with iOS as it's just too inflexible and is becoming somewhat childish in terms of interface. Samsung's implementation of the Android platform is smooth, highly-polished and commendable. It's not as fast as the pure product in the Nexus lineup, but does not suffer as all as a result.The octacore processor in the non-US model is just pure sweeping power. It's a good thing that the battery is a hefty 3500mAh unit or it wouldn't last the day. That said, if you're the kind of user who has multiple applications running all day long - and I'm among that userbase - this phone will take it all in its stride and not break a sweat. The screen is absolutely beautiful without being too highly saturated, the cameras (both front and back) are immensely capable and the return of expandable storage through cheap and capacious micro-SD cards is very welcome.Physically, the phone is svelte, lightweight and sits in the hand beautifully. Even without a case, there's no feeling that you'll drop it at any moment. One of the finest physical features is the waterproofing that doesn't require that you slap chunks of rubber into the ports to maintain its integrity. no more panics when you're caught in that torrential downpour about your phone suffering a premature demise.I haven't tried any of the included accessories such as the micro-USB cable, charger or earbuds as I already have very high quality 3rd-party versions. From the look of them, they appear to be reasonable quality.For anyone in the US who's concerned about losing out on network connectivity by using a phone from an overseas market, rest assured. I used a SIM card linked to T-Mobile's 4G network and had absolutely no issue anywhere with obtaining a good strong 4G signal. The Exynos processor in the US market model, while likely perfectly adequate, will almost certainly be that touch slower than the beast in the overseas market product.If you're like me, fear running out of power when you're away out all day and carry a power bank, know that the quick charge 2 feature has this from about 5% to fully charged in around an hour. The genuine Samsung quick charge puck may be slower to re-add the juice, but it's utterly convenient when you're a tired and then don't have to worry about not quite plugging the phone in to charge.If you're seeking to buy a phone without the burden of a contract, do yourself a big favour: Save some money, get this model, use one of the probably five or six wall chargers you already have and enjoy this incredible handset. It may be coming from outside of the US, but it's delivered quickly and I have no doubt whatsoever that it'll be loved every bit as I love mine. This is the best phone I've ever had, and the added bonus of saving on the cost of purchasing outright through Best Buy, etc is the icing on an already very delicious cake."
Got horizontal lines on display within few days of usage. Unable to return it because the timeline to return has expired :(
"Bought this specifically because I wanted the Exynos processor instead of the Snapdragon and so that I can root if I wanted to. I'm on T-Mobile US and did my research to ensure that my bands are supported - which they all are except for some 3G. I bought this phone from a seller named 'lifeline###' and the box the phone came in had the factory seal. As another reviewer pointed out, my phone originated from the United Arab Emirates so this came with a non-US friendly charge adapter and the manual appears to be in English & Arabic. In any case, the phone is great working order and I was able to just pop in my T-Mobile SIM card with no configuration needed, nor a visit to the T-Mobile store!I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 so all I had was the regular charging block which doesn't support the fast charge. I went ahead and purchased the Aukey QC 3.0 block and I'm fast charging away!"
Be aware that black translucent lines may appear across the screen even after very short period of usage.
"It has meet my expectations, thank you however the battery life can be improved a little more."
"Best phone I've had yet. really happy with it. Very fast, the battery lasts very long and the camera is really really good. Whenever my friends take pictures they always ask for my phone because the camera is just so much better. If you're an adroid person and you're looking for your flagship phone, don't look any further.If you're in the USA, this comes with a default European adapter plug and US converter."
The phone meets all expectations. It's excellent. I Love It.
"The build quality is excellent, on par with Apples external build quality.This devices edge design makes looking at the screen much more interesting, and less ""flat"". It is similar to looking into a slight bubble. The buttons are very tactile, and the fingerprint sensor and it's controlling software work well.Samsung's TouchWiz implementation on top of Android 6.0.1 raises no real complaint from me. I do not use their ""Edge UI"", but it can be fully disabled easily."
every thing is ok
definitely unlocked and works well in my country.
"Waaaaay better than my iPhone. Can't say enough good things about it so I'll leave it at this: if you don't have one, you're missing out."
Excelente
package was sent with the warranty seal opened however the seller clarified the reason of that. Phone works fine.My previous phone was a Samsung 5 but this one is amazing.
It is very good
"Love the phone so far, haven't really used it yet. But the charger is not compatible with the outlets here. Really disappointed about that, because now I have to either purchase another or find an adapter. Is there anywhere in the description that stated this was the type of charger used?"
Best mobile ever
"This item was received on April 21. On May 14, I filed a request to return the item since there are problems. Runs hot. Locks up and does not reset. The supplier, Worldwide Distributors responded on May 16, stating that I needed to contact Samsung Tech Support directly, providing no contact information for Samsung. Mind you, this is within the 30 day return window, but they never mentioned this in their response. I have contacted both them and Samsung and ALL i get is a run around. I cannot use the phone and I am not asking for my money back, I need a working phone."
Great phone
"Great device with so much to offer. I recommend buying from the seller, ""Mobiles International LLC."" They sent a new and reliable device and honored a warranty for a defective product on Samsung's behalf. :)"
Worldwide Distributors great job.
Beautiful phone
Good phone.

Legit Company. The phone is brand new no issues... & these guys are fast!!!
Great
I have it for a about a year and works great!
"Screen failed in under 4 months. No warranty, no repairs. You are paying for a future $600 brick."
Works with American AT&T no problems. The 4g lte symbol does not show up but I know I get the speeds. Very happy that I purchased it
"Love this phone so far. It has been reliable and works as advertised. This is the international version, which means certain apps, like Samsung Pay, don't work. It's only come up a couple of times, but it is annoying. Not a negative on the phone, it's clear that this is the case. Just wanted to spread awareness."
"do not buy a international phone some features will not work,,,,,,,,, This seller is slow on returns"
"I bought this phone in August for my wife, the phone has been a hassle from the get go. Two weeks after purchase the volume button started moving erratically on its own. Then the phone started hanging and will not reset by just switching off the phone, we need to hold the power button and the decrease volume button at the same time. The frequency of hanging just kept increasing, even after the doing a factory reset the phone continued to deteriorate. I am highly disappointed! I would have returned the phone if the window had not elapsed. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"
"Excelente Product!! No objections, just get a antislip case cause is like silk"
Got it on time and everything was perfect. The charger was european so it came with an adapter. Works perfect.
Awsome!
Great item still testing durability and exploring features.
every new phone has firsttime open setting.but it already opened and has 7% power left when I got it .even when I Check the background.there has some apps .one of them is setting.I use to worked in a store(someone like bestbuy) in china.i was the manager of 3C(cell phone .camera )department.so I know what we did to the returned phones.but to renew a phone.at least clear the data and make sure no one will know.please do things professional.
"Awesome phone, great build quality, very slim, i had a samsung galaxy S3 before, and that phone last like 8 months, hate it samsung for their build quality, since then i've been trying another brands, so i decided to give samsung another try and guess what i love this phone, my only complain is the battery it doesn't last long like the iphone 6s plus, it has one of the best AMOLED screen i have ever seen the color are very bright and clear so if you want a phone buy this one you'll not regret it."
"Really is an amazing phone well worth the upgrade,"
The phone is really good
"It is slippery. But i mean really really slippery. It is so slippery that it can be used to grease a pan. I heard that in the dictionary they added a picture of the Samsung S7 in the word slippery definition. It is THE MOST slippery thing i have ever seen in my entire life. You couldn't hold it with your hands even if you had frog fingers, because it is so slippery. If you don't mind a slippery phone, go ahead, but i must warn you.. it is very slippery. Very very slippery.(Ps. I tried to add a photo of something very slippery so you can relate but couldn't find, cause all i can think of a slippery thing is Samsung S7)"
Very good
Everything was ok the phone is great :)
This phone is absolutely stellar. Amazing screen even in direct sunlight. Battery life is tremendous. The ONLY drawback is this version isn't compatible with Samsung Pay at this time in the US.
"Awesome phone and amazing camera I mean this is the camera to beat. S7 edge due to the bigger battery almost has 2 day battery life, touch wiz has been heavily refined, but nova is still the way to go. Design is slick and still a head turner and feels great in the hand. Number 1 of the top 3 Android phones , and I highly recommend only con is no Samsung Pay for international."
I'm satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy s7 EdgeIt's very good product beautiful. I truly loved.
"Buying this unlocked international Galaxy S7 Edge had me worried at first, it was in Spanish when I turned it on. You need to have your sim card inserted before you can change the language! After getting it to English I am totally please with it. I had the Galaxy S5, and compared to that phone, this Galaxy S7 Edge is AMAZING! There are so my new and cool features. I took 4 days to receive the phone. I'm totally satisfied with this purchase."
Love it. Exynos processor is much faster than us versionAlso I travel a lot to Mexico so be able to switch SIM cards is awesome
Excellent vendor. Product is exact as described. All Perfect.Recommend to all.
Great service. No issues .
Excelente
Exactly as promised. Was worried I wouldn't be able to activate it with an American carrier (since the included documentation indicated that might be a problem as opposed to requiring a European carrier to activate it first) but it worked fine.
Why the phone doesnt say galaxy s7 edge on the back ?
"I paid for a new phone, but the phone I received was already set up and displays 7 voicemails from the 19th of April thru the 13th of May, and the plastic film was put back on upside down. WTH! Sadly not only are they thieves, but they are incompetent thieves!"
"Liked a lot the device. Only thing that came with very low, cheap quality was the AC adaptert. Look like the one you buy in grocery shop at half dollar. All accesories came within sealed box (headphones, sim remover, usb adapter, charger, device, etc)"
"Excellent and awesome phone! I think I won't upgrade this phone 2 years 'cuz it has everything! micro SD, OUTSTANDING battery! water and dust resistance and AMAZING and colorful screen! and flawless performance! It's just magnificent!"
Not sure why the reception is so weak Bad antenna ?
"Hands down the best cell phone I have ever owned. I have a iPhone 6 for work which I love, but this S7 beats it by a mile. Battery life is outstanding unlike so many Android phones, and the display and camera are top notch. I like this international version with the non-US processor and it seems to be getting better battery life than the Snapdragon processor for the domestic market. Either version though is still the best on the market."
The Q&A said this comes with a US power adapter. Mine did not. I got the German pin-type power connector without any adapters for the US.
Excelente
This cell phone is so pretty，I love the edge！But sometimes it will overheat.
Way better than buying carrier branded and bloated version. Awesome phone!
Amazing phone
Everything great. Bought from wirelessplace.
Yes. sick lookin phone. I saw couple of feedback that says fake phone or something fishy. In my case it was all good. And about the phone it's great! Nothing much added to s7 accept hardware improvement. Touch unlock is much much better then s6 generation. Great bettary life something aspect from Samsung. Not dissopointed at all.
"Excellent phone. Everything arrived well to Venezuela, except the travel charger that does not work"
"I bought this right after my iPhone decided to stop working which was this past Saturday and I'm not disappointed. It's definitely bigger than the iPhone 6 so sometimes it feels like I can't hold it right..The battery life is amazing, great camera - Def different than a iPhone camera, great screen size and colorI have Cricket Wireless as my network and it's working great,BTW that company has the same signal as AT&T, but sometimes I have to resend texts several times, it's gotten annoying. Idk if that's a phone thing or provider issue?My last android was the galaxy S3 now to the S7 Edge, incredible improvement"
Excelent
One of the best phones out there.
I like the camera.
"DO NOT BUY! They will NOT SUPPORT YOU! DO NOT BUY! Purchased on June 10th 2016. 3 months later, the PHONE BRICKS. No damage, no spill, never even touched water, in a case its whole life. Just stops working, going on, nothing. Got extremely hot for about 2 hours for no reason after it went dead, but then nothing after that. Called Samsung (had registered the device and everything), first they collected info on the phone and said they will call back in 24 hours. Waited a week, no call. Called back and they straight up told me they will not help because Samsung America does not help Samsung Anywhere-else. They connected Amazon, and Amazon just dropped the phone on me in mid sentence with no call back! (And no number I can call them back). Return policy ends July 31st ONE MONTH+ after the order!!Basically if you buy this phone from here you will not be supported if anything goes wrong.... and my phone BRICKED with neither Samsung, Amazon or TheCoos stepping up to the plate to support or repair. I wonder why Apple has a loyal fanbase? *Dripping with Sarcasm*DO NOT BUY! They will NOT SUPPORT YOU! DO NOT BUY!"
"Phone works well for two months. Then the display turned off. I tryed to get support from Samsung, and they said is an International version, it has not warranty in the US. Needs to be sent to Australia for warranty service. Very ugly experience"
All ok
Work with metropcs YEAH
It's awesome. Using it now to type this
It's perfect!!
It is easy usage.
It met my expectations
"The best phone you will ever have, can handle many applications in background and it still responds as expected, zero lags and the curved screen is the best.The phone came with the AC adaptor as it's for Africa but I had no problems at all, the quick charge is just amazing and the battery lasts the whole day (5am to 11pm) with no need to additional battery charges.Go for the gold version it's the most classy one. Some photos that I took they look so real. Enjoy!"
"Original, reliable."
"I really like the phone, but nobody mentioned that Samsung Pay does not work with this, the international version - I had to call Samsung Support to find that out.. disappointed and send it back for that reason..."
Good.. thanks...
"This is a great phone! screen, design, camera, you won't have complains. Except that there are options almost as good as that for a lot less money."
Excelent all
"Exynos processor. ISOCELL camera sensor. No Carrier bloatware. Suspiciously missing the Galaxy S7 Edge logo on the back shown in the photo. Aida64 shows the correct info, though.I've used the phone for over a week, now. I'm very happy with it. Still getting used to some aspects of the interface, but what it does, it does incredibly quickly. No lag in anything. Samsung has some nice features included. I love the health suite. I love the battery life.Cons: the duplicate apps. I want the ability to remove the browser, email app, etc. Things that I don't use. Things that Google also includes. Can't uninstall those either, surprisingly. Also, the whole Edge thing... There aren't enough ways to customize it or the edge notifications which display with the always on display. Also, the built-in so to transfer app data from your old phone didn't work with my HTC One."
I have been using this phone for three days now. I was impressed that the phone was delivered sooner than expected. The box was sealed and everything was intact. My only problem is that this phone came with a plug you use in Europe and where I live we use the plugs used in the US. Not a big problem since I can charge the phone with other chargers. I bought the international version since I read that the Exynos chip is better than Snapdragon. I previously used a Samsung S3 which recently died and it wasn't a difficult transition. I also have a P8 Lite which in my opinion takes better selfies. I'd still buy the S7 edge again though. The phone is very fast. Battery life is exceptional. I have only charged it once so far and it still has 52% of battery life left! I also love that the phone is very loud. The phone fits easily in my small hands and is pretty light. I also love being able to unlock the phone with my fingerprint. I also love that the speaker is very loud. For someone who's hard of hearing like me that is a plus!
"Less than ONE MONTH after I purchased this, it's gone wonky...randomly restarting even when I'm not using it, freezing then re-starting when I AM using it...I LOVE the S7 Edge, but I knew buying on Amazon was a BAD IDEA.If there's any way to exchange this item without having to go without a phone for a week, I want to exchange it...but I work from my phone and this is a real crap-storm right now."
"The device is a 100% win. The only aspect that I didn't really understand is that at the back of the phone it doesn't say ""Galaxy s7 edge"". Other than that it's a pretty awesome deal."
"I have received my Samsung Galaxy S7 G935F satisfactorily, NGP Store you are the Best! Thank you for the order. I will have present you for make more purchases in the future."
"The phone that was sold to me as unlocked is asking for a network unlock code.... this is BS, the phone is not actually unlocked. Wireless Everything is not telling the truth about this. If I don't receive any contact I can only conclude that I was taken to the cleaners and my money is down the rat hole."
"For reference, my previous phones were not flagship phones but rather they call under the budget/mid-range smartphone category. This may skew my review a bit since I'm going from mid range to flagship, but I think the Galaxy S7 Edge has so much going for it that it doesn't matter too much about my previous reviews.PREVIOUS PHONESNexus 5, OnePlus One, OnePlus Two, Nexus 5x, Honor 5xDESIGNThis phone is beautiful. Honestly, I love looking at this phone and I find myself wiping down the phone to maintain it's reflective silver reflection. In the day and age of large phones, the Galaxy S7 edge finds the perfect size.(To Be Continued. I'm writing this on my lunch break)SUPER AMOLED DISPLAYThe display on thisPERFORMANCECAMERABATTERY LIFE IS FOREVERWATERPROOFINGFINGERPRINT READERIf I had to fault this phone for anything, it would be the fingerprint reader. For some reason, my phone doesn't always recongnize my fingerprints. I've reset them a couple times and it still doesn't always read it correctly. My last three phones had fingerprint readers and they were all quicker or more accurate than the S7 Edge. I suspect that it's because the home button is very short (height-wise) and that the home button is raised.FEATURES FEATURES FEATURES"
"I purchased it for my GF, she loves it...It was in GSM so the day I received it I went to Walmart purchased a Mano sim for 9.99 Go Phone. POP it in and it works great she still playing with it and learning the many feature"
This phone is a mess. I used to love the first months but now I don't have any signal( I tried 3 conpanies already) and is heaing up and freezing and starting the phone. Also my fingerprins don't work. I can't believe amazon is selling fake phones or damaged phones
"DO NOT TRUST this product on this seller.I bought TWO WEEKS AGO and the device showed:1.) problems with fingerprint lock. Basically this feature adds 30 seconds of waiting time before using your phone, since it consistenly does not work, and it locks your phone after 3 tries.2.) Phone would consistenly freeze (once a day) with the watch on. The only solution is restaring the phone. and the freezed clock is an extra because it made me lose a few meetings.3.) ""unbreakle glass"" screen broke after ONE WEEK OF USE, in my FRONT pocket, without never even even falling on the flor. it was ONE SINGLE coin that made the damage."
"My husband and I bought these as an upgrade from our previous Galaxy S5s. I got the rose gold and he got the black one. The rose gold color wasn't as rosy as I thought it would be, it's more of a champagne color. The black one looks very sophisticated and elegant. I must say that I was not a fan of Samsung borrowing Apple's idea of no memory storage and making it difficult to put the sim card in but it was an easy fix with being able to send all of my extra photos to my Samsung account. Upon arrival, the packaging makes sure the product is not harmed whatsoever (lots and lots of bubble wrap). In all honesty I was afraid the phone was not going to hold up very long because of the glass edge and because I'm prone to dropping my phone...a lot. However even with out a case it has held up quite well. The photo quality of the front and rear camera is amazing, definitely a step (or two) up from the S5. We decided to buy on amazon because the price listed was $200-$300 cheaper than buying in stores, plus free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime. All in all I would highly reccommend this phone if you're a Samsung lover like myself."
LED screen started to flash in and out and show a blue screen after 3 weeks. Battery is already over heating after 3 weeks of use. Battery life sucks.
Inserted AT&T and works absolutely fine.Great phone.
"I bought the cellphone as gift for my brother, and to honest, he's really happy.Service was really good, I'm really satisfied about the product and also the serviceGood job!"
I love it
CAME WITH A WRONG CHARGER FOR EUROPE VERSION
You have background colors in it but the second one that I received it worked perfect
"I will never again buy a phone through a cell service provider. Buying unlocked through Amazon or some other reputable source saves you about 20%, and here's the really great part: no bloatware! Be careful to ensure that the phone will work with your service provider, but if it will this is the way to go without a doubt."
Awesome phone!
i only had my phone for about 3 weeks and the screen start jumping rapidly
The phone is good except the phone's charger is not the US version.
very good quality Amazon good job
"Telephone edge Dandy Yes, it's a phone in the top extravaganza I've loved phone I am very happy very, very strong"
"Love the phone I bought (black onyx). Works very well. Great camera, great screen sensitvity and charges quickly. The only downside is that I have to use a converter with the fast charging cord. I find it cumbersome although it works well. I guess it was made for a British market."
"It's everything i hoped for in a cellphone. It is fast, beautiful,though the camara doesn't really take great pictures in low light or dark spaces. Eveything else is just perfect!"
You can't go wrong this phone is awesome....
the machine.very good
"I bought this phone for my dad and he is in love with it. It has fast-charging and all the high end specs that you could ask for in a top tier device. I don't know much about it, besides the fact that there hasn't been any issues thus far. It's got some interesting features and is a pleasure to use, I can tell you that much!"
Love this phone. Super fast. Screen is nice and big. Loaded with a bunch of great features.I connected it with cricket. Only 55 a month get great signal (cricket uses att towers)So i get nice fast connection with a low monthly cellphone bill.
Good
"I use StraightTalk with this phone. It took no more than an hour to transfer my phone number to this phone, and I had exactly 0 issues with it since. If you want a brand new unlocked phone, I would recommend no further than this. It did come with some sort of foreign software, and Facebook and Instagram seem to be installed and non-removable, but they were trivial to disable."
good
"Easily the best phone I've owned. Period. Great battery life compared with my last 3 phones (xperia Z2/Note 4/LG G4) Extremely fast, reliable, easily manages all my applications (55), great camera, waterproof.. And on and on... Great phone.. Really worth the price. Chose it over the S7 due screen size and battery life expectancy."
no 4G LTE .. Wireless PLACE..w
Those black lines showed up from no where. I don't know what is the problem . I would like to get an exchange please
I'like. Good product.
It's not working. I need new one Tuesday. Wednesday I'm going back to Turkey. If I can't get one till Tuesday it doesn't matter what I liked or disliked about this
Samsung android phone is the best way to go. So glad they put the mini-sd storage back in.
"Amazing phone, totally better than the s7 normal. The edge rocks and is si much better in every aspect!!!"
I was completely satisfied!
My seller Wlaphones did all as promised. They sent the phone in 2 days and had no problem no change the delivery address since I moved and totally forgot to make the change. 5 stars to the seller and 5 stars to the phone. I've had it for around 2 weeks and had no problems to activate it in TMobile. Amazing phone and great seller
"Is not a Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE.(SM-G935F) .It's a regular Galaxy S7 (SM-G930F)..accidental mistake or intentional error , But it's not the product that I payed for..I'am realy furious ..Be Carefully .."
The seller was good. They send me a sealed box. The problem is the phone. I bought it to use in Argentina. When I opened the phone in Argentina there was a pink line on the screen. It's a full pixel dead line across the screen. Y search on internet and it is a common problem with the edge phones and the solution is a new module/screen. There is no guaranty for me here.
"This phone is absolutely amazing. I could go on about the class leading camera, the all-day battery life, the amazing screen, the unquestionably useful Always On Display. That's probably not the most impressive thing about this phone though. Think about an iPhone 6/6S/7 Plus. Now think of the most annoying problem with that phone. If you're like me then the most annoying problem is undoubtedly the ENORMOUS bezels on the side of the phone. For those of us who want a bigger screen (because it usually means more features/a better viewing experience) the iPhone is damn near impossible to hold in the hand because after the screen ends, there is a huge swath of space on the sides that add several critical millimeters to the width of the phone. Not with this phone. The curved display not only looks amazing, but serves to give the phone a very compact footprint for the 5.5"" screen you are getting.That being said, there are things I don't like. Samsung still needs to make their software more stable and less energy inefficient. The longevity is more a virtue of the large battery than the software. Additionally the software can sometimes have funny quirks. Nothing too bad, but just things that are a little weird or slow sometimes.I also recommend that you buy a case for this phone. More than anything else on the market it's a work of art and you'll want to preserve it. I personally recommend this: Spigen Thin Fit Galaxy S7 Edge Case with SF Coated Non Slip Matte Surface for Excellent Grip for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 2016 - Black. This case is thin and almost feels like it isn't there. It'll make your phone easier to grip and give you piece of mind while you're out all day with it."
Received the phone and it was cracked
"Don't buy anything from this seller/company. I bought a Samsung Galaxy s7 edge, not even 2 months after the cell phone stopped working, Plus they don't accept returns."
Pretty nice phone. it looks great. it is very fast and i love the camera.
"Be careful , It comes with UK Plug ."
"Excellent screen, fast, good battery life, has met my expectations."
Phone stop working in 3 months
"Hello, shipping has come to the House of my friend in Miami. I traveled the day November 15, that day I will know if you are all well. thank you."
"The seal was broken. The phone was completely fine, and it is the original phone. Other than that, all as is to be expected - great product!"
"Everything as expected, better than punctual. I missed that the charger was not compatible with 110w plug but it came with a converter."
It's an excellent phone very fest and he has an excellent reception. Also the battery is very very good doesn't run out but if you have small end it's hard with the hedge
"If I had the option of voting ""Zero"" stars I would. I bought my Galaxy S7 Edge and paid full price for it less than 7 months ago. Now the phone is presenting a hardware problem which was already acknowledged by Samsung that it is a factory problem, what means, they know it is their problem and that they are supposed to get it fixed or exchanged. However, because it is an ""Unlocked International Version"", no Samsung authorized service would even touch the phone. Not even if I am paying for the service. So, now I have a USD 800 paper weight worth nothing at all. I hope Samsung is reading this. I have been a Samsung Loyal customer since Galaxy S II and now I am dropping this ""Loyalty"" for a Windows Phone (yeah, Windows Phone. After wasting my money with a ""Samsung Flagship"", a windows Phone is all I could afford to buy). Thanks Samsung, you have made an (ex) customer really (un)happy !!!!!!"
"My boyfriend got this phone over the summer, and he actually likes it much better than his former iPhone. It comes with earbuds, a charging cable, and a very useful charging adaptor to accommodate different charging ports. I personally think it's too big, but I have small hands haha. Overall, a very reliable phone that works really well."
"phone is good, but the seller is a swindler"
Great phone! Great Seller!
This is an Arabic/arab version . The retail box came opened. Not sure if it is new.
"WOULDN,T TRADE IT FOR NOTHING ."
"I bought this cell some days ago and I couldn't be happier. This Latam version is working fine in Argentina. It's good to check before you buy if you cell works with in your country and carrier at [...] , very helpful...Thanks."
"The gadget works perfectly in Brazil, with VIVO 4G, but the battery life is poor."
Like
It's an excellent phone...
Very good
It stoped to work after 2 months. I am very disappoint.
"The features are OK, but it's not a great value. Not a huge step up from the Galaxy 6. If you have a Galaxy 6 edge and are looking to upgrade, hold off on this one. It's not groundbreaking stuff. More of the same."
Hi thereI ordered this samsung galaxy s7 on jun 17 nd everything was very very great until 2 week ago i just realized that in the screen there is one pixel wrong. Is almost imperseptible but if you focus on this pixel you can see how s*** it looks like
Techno master always send products that after 2 weeks you start seeing the defects. It has happened twice in less than 2 months.
all perfect!
Great phone. Improved battery life. Awesome camera.
"Problems with my product samsung galaxy s7 edge:1. Samsung galaxy s7 edge Box was not sealed2. It was labelled International version at the bottom of the box and also labelled American sim only at the back of the box3. After starting the device, I noticed the bottom right corner of the screen had a little blacked out portion on the display itself. (maybe damaged item was sent)4. When I opened the unsealed box, content was not arranged as it should be ideally. (It was messed up)"
Amazing smartphone. It's highly recommended
Broken phone!!!!!
Because the wife likes it
Good
"I love my S7 edge, the only thing is sometimes gets too hot."
Exelente
Best phone I've ever owned!
"Arrived on time, came in sealed box, looked new an outside. I wish I could see an inside. Samsung Manufacturer/assembly in Vietnam. Works fine with T-Mobile. I will try on others carriers."
DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!! THEY ARE SELLING FAKE GALAXY S7 EDGES!!!! The box will be opened and not sealed. When the phone is on you will notice that there is a black line around the screen that should also not be there. Those are two dead giveaways that this is a cheap Chinese fake.
Thanks all is perfect
"Everything perfect, I recomend!"
I was a little hesitant that this phone wasn't going to be what I ordered but I was wrong. The first time opening the box was truly amazing I tried the phone out for two week and I'm loving the phone. Everything works fast and I'm very happy that I got it in the white version. The only problem for me was delivery but it is not the fault of the seller. I would've liked it if the left it on my porch because I had to drive and get it from the nearest ups store. Overall the best smartphone of 2016 I don't care what anybody says.
Love this.
Before buying refurbished phone from seller MASTERTRONICS. I had asked if it was compatible with my provider and if it had large scratches. He assured me full compatibility and no scratches. I have to say he was right phone works perfectly and have not one scratch I would definitely recommend this seller I will definitely purchase from seller again thank you for this amazing buy it could not ask for more.
Matt every expectation shipped quickly got here well and was easy to set up
"I bought the white version of the Samsung S7 edge and it is a amazing and gorgeous phone. It was really difficult to find it because it's not available for the US but it totally worth the trouble. I got the italian edition of it and it works nice and smooth with my Mexican SIM card, it doesn't has any preloaded content which is great and the preinstalled apps are the same as the US version. The only ""issue"" might be that the power connector of the charger is European, but the seller solved it in a great way by including an American adapter. I love my new phone and the whole experience was excellent with this seller.I used to be an iPhone lover, but Samsung did a great jog with this one and I'm perfectly happy of having taked the risk. Totally recommended!"
Works fantastic. Arrived on time. Thanks for a great product and purchasing experience.
i love it!!!!!!
"I've always been at the front of the smartphone market, usually replacing yearly, and I can say this phone is amazing. Pure and simple. Highly recommend."
"Excellent smartphone for discerning people who want the very best features and user experience.Comes factory unlocked and compatible with all major US carriers (Both GSM and CDMA) and with complete US Warranty. Zero bloatware. Beautiful silver design looks stunning and will grab everyone's attention. As soon as I inserted the SIM card, it automatically installed all special features from my carrier (Supports Wi-Fi calling & Hotspot from T-Mobile).I bought this device after extensive research to upgrade my aging Galaxy Note 2 smartphone. The Galaxy S7 Edge has arguably the best camera among flagship smartphones, water resistant, excellent battery life, access to all apps and content in Google Play Store, Amazon App Store, and Galaxy App Store. The user interface is very customizable thanks to free and premium themes in Samsung's store and custom launchers. You can extend storage space up to 256 GB via SD Card (Pro Tip: Get the best possible SD card in order to be able to record hours of crisp 4K video footage).If you're on the fence between this and another flagship smartphone (I was looking at the iPhone 7), what will win you over is the amount of productivity and creativity that is possible with this device due to unparalleled multitasking features and sheer computing power. Try doing two things at once on an iPhone and you will be sorely disappointed, maybe Google Pixel is a contender in this department."
Incredible phone!
"For the most part I think its a fantastic phone but especially with the curved screen, it is a bit slippery and hard to hold so a case is a must. Also, the battery life isn't quite as good as I was expecting but still decent. Otherwise, as far as performance and everything goes, I'm really happy with it, especially the beautiful camera! The only real complaint is the tiny amount of internal storage. There are some things like Google Play Music that store downloads on the internetal memory rather than an external card so it fills things up very fast and can cause issues. If they doubled the internal memory, that would be enough for me to bump it up to 5 stars."
Awesome phone
Phone came exactly as advertised. Was able to activate it with no problems and runs like the wind. No complaints.
The only thing...the seal was broken upon arrival! The phone appear to be in new condition.
Got Perfect product..
retired my s6 and am very happy with all the advanced features and organization of the aps. really intuitive.
Found severe OVER-HEATING problem.
I've gotten this phone twice. One for my wife and one for myself and both come two days earlier from the date it was suppose to come. The phone itself is wonderful and works great nothing off from it. I recommend to buy this phone from here
Excellent
I need to know how I can return my phone is warming muchI like but need another phone on the brink of both heating esplotar phone?
phone did not connect to AT&T 4G network. Provides basic internet access only. Cannot use.
the touch screen sometimes does not work
"Phone came broken, charger ports are faulty. This is the second faulty phone i have recieved. Dont know if the issue is samsung or the seller, but I would advise everybody not to buy this phone. If you are buying a european phone in the US, samsung usa will not be able to help you."
I've always been a fan of the iPhone series. In fact the last one I had was the iPhone 6s Plus. But I recently traded it out for the Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge. This phone is AMAZING and is lightning quick. It's very responsive to your touch and the 5.5 inch screen makes it a breeze to read whatever your doing on the phone. I am HIGHLY SATISFIED by this phone. I think Samsung really outdid themselves this time.
"Awesome, customizable, and Stylish !!!"
Screen was half green when it arrived. Do not buy.
I give the Galaxy S7 Edge a 5 star rating. It does everything I want from a cell phone.
The phone is amazing. I can't get the white one in North America so I ordered it through Amazon. The only thing is that it came with a eroupean charger which can easily be fixed by buying a piece to change it to North American styled plugs.
"Is a Korean version, works perfect in Agentina with 4g.LTE Claro network ..every thing goes find except por same apps and menues, that aperars in Korean..I disabed in order do not disturb. Upgrade also are working ok."
"I must say this first; this phone does not play nice with Sprint. It continuously goes through this activation loop with Sprint. It activates (Hands Free Activation), restarts, then activates again in a continuous loop. I don't know if it's on Sprint's end, or if its their UICC SIM card. I'm not even sure if it's the phone itself because it's doing the same thing on the replacement phone that Amazon sent to me.However, it works fine with T-Mobile, and the VoWiFi calling feature works well straight out of the box without any user configuration.I haven't tried it on AT&T or Verizon yet.Otherwise, other than the Sprint problem, the phone works great. The Wi-Fi works well; the display is bright, crisp, clear and brilliant; it's speedy fast (no lag); and it's basic (no carrier bloatware). It has 23 GB of available space out of the box.Another thing, I must say the phone gets really hot and the battery drains quickly, but, then, again, it could be entirely due to the Sprint Hands Free Activation looping thing. I don't know. I called Samsung, Samsung tells me to contact Sprint. I called Sprint, Sprint tells me to contact Samsung. This is frustrating !I have model number SM-G935UZSAXAA."
Excelent!
Very pleased with this purchase.
Great phone! Love it
excelent I like so much!!
Phone wasn't unlocked to be used in Asia. Had to pay for unlocking.
I saw a black spot/dent on the bottom left of my new S7 edge while unwrapping! I need a refund or replacement!
"I love the phone but I hate how some features aren't available such as android pay (Not available in my area), and also the changing time. It takes approx 40 min to charge from 30 percent using fast charge and fast charge products.If anyone can recommend a solution it would be greatly appreciated.Using a European version GS7 Edge in the USA. I don't know if it's the voltage."
So far so good. The only thing I just found out is that since it's an international unlocked phone from Italy I don't have warranty here for the phone in the US.
"This phone exceeded my expectations. I did some research beforehand about the 2 different chips that were put in the phones. I will have to say the international version has lived up to the hype. I've had this phone for about 3 weeks and there has only been one day where the battery was about to die. But this was after a 10 hour trip running Google maps, taking pictures, videos, games and other things. The phone was off the charger at 630 am and had 9% left at 830. Not bad going from a HTC One M7 that couldn't make it to 4pm without a charge. The camera is fast and takes great pictures. I've had a few compliments on how amazing the screen looks. The only thing I have heard other people complain was about not having Samsung Pay, I have never used it and I don't think it's a deal breaker."
Very nice phone. Son says it does a lot.
"If your LTE is not working on AT&T on this phone, you need to tell them to keep your old phone's IMEI in their system instead of putting the edge's IMEI in there. If you put the edge's IMEI in their system, for some dumb reason their system won't recognize the phone because it's international, and the system will automatically provision you down to 3G only. Also europe's 4G logo doesn't say ""LTE"", the logo just says 4G but it is in fact 4G LTE, just FYI. For more than a day I thought I was going to have to return this because I wasn't getting LTE, then I went to a different store the next day where I figured out to keep my old phone's IMEI in the system so I could get LTE on the international edge.I have had the phone for 4 weeks now I think, zero problems so far, nothing was wrong with the packaging. My edge came from Italy. Purchased from vendor ""Wireless Everything"", thank you."
"This is without a single doubt, the best smart phone on the market. I have played with the LG G5 and the HTC 10, and I can tell you neither are in the class of the S7, and especially not the S7 Edge Exynos version. The Exynos version has better battery life than the Snapdragon 820 version, and it does a much, much, much better job with power and memory management. The white one is my favorite, and I had to look high and low to find one. But I have it now, and it's very cool to have what almost nobody else has. Great phone! It's stylish, well built, beautifully sculpted with the best screen in the industry. Even touchwiz is light, fast and smooth. This phone has ZERO lag. Everything's better on the Edge. And don't let people tell you that the edge feature is gimmicky. It is EXACTLY what you make it. If you don't spend a minute learning what it can do, it will do little for you. But, if you decide to learn all of its features, and employ them fully, this feature can be one of the best on the device. I also didn't find it useful at first, because I allowed all of the reviewers to influence me that it is just a gimmick. But then I watched a review where the guy really laid out what it could actually do, and decided to look into it further. In the end, I have found it to be a vital part of my functions on this phone. So if you are part of the ""too lazy to discover"" generation, then you might not find it useful. But if you want to get all you can out of this device, it can become vital.One last thing, get a case for this phone immediately. The biggest drawback of this device is that if you break it, the waterproofing is gone, even after repair."
Excellent cell phone and Great service!! thank you so much
delivered fastgood phone so farthough many apps in chinese/korean that i cannot uninstall
"I have never bought a phone outside a carrier. That and the fact the label said International and No Warranty really had me concern. Not having ATT branding and stuff cluttering my new expensive phone was enticing though. Not having ATT block or delay my phone updates also was interesting. Having a white phone was a small but nice benefit too. So I cancel my ATT purchase and bought from Mercate Group. ATT said it would ship at the end of month, Mercate said I would have my phone by the end of month. Reality was Mercate quickly sent me my phone within a week. Did not have to pay extra for quick shipping either. When I contacted seller about warranty they said they would honor the 1 year warranty. With no sales tax through Amazon I saved $55, got my preferred phone unbranded and unlocked, quicker and cheaper than ATT. Though I must say ATT activated the phone to my GOPhone account quickly and easily with no charge either. So far I am extremely satisfied with everything regarding this purchase. As far as warranty we will have to wait and hope not to need it. Another thing is that the AC charger included has a European plug but an adapter was included, I think by Mercate,"
Really like this phone. I get a lot of compliments from others. The clarity of this screen is unbelievable. Great for video playback and gaming
Great phone. Edge not only aesthetic but also functional.
Couldn't have a better phone!
I received the phone on time but the phone kept on restating by itself.
"Upgrading from the Emerald Green s6 Edge to this was amazing! It feels great in the hand and runs smooth! Its extremely fast and eye catching! Everyone always asks where I got it and which stores sell it since it isn't available here in the US. My phone carrier is Metro PCS and I haven't had any problems with the phone or service since getting it activated/registered.Just know that you HAVE to bring it into the store to get it activated. Otherwise, popping in a SIM card that you already have and trying to use the phone will only last for so long until they realize your SIM is in a different phone. Part of their security shuts off your service if you do this without registering your new device with Metro PCS so please take your new phone in to get it activated. I hope that makes sense. Plus the employee at your local phone store will be amazed because they have probably never seen a white s7 Edge if you live in the states, haha! :P"
"The cellphone is amazing, it was shipped and delivered quickly. Mine is the US version unlocked (SM-G935U) and it works excellent with Metro PCS. Mine has warranty until September next year. You can check that with your imei when you get the phone on info.imeiBut...The phone didn't come with the Sim extraction tool, and the packaging was very bad, just a big cardboard box with another cardboard box and the phone inside, the should of put some air bags or something for couchon. Anyway the phone is in great condition and it hasn't given me problems so far. My phone came with the Samsung earphones, quick charger and cable. I truly recommend to get the phone a case. I got one from spigen, you should check it out, they do very nice cases."
Great Phone. Awesome camera. Exceed expectations.
This is the best phone ever. The size is perfect and it's a very quick operating system
New phone came out of case with data transfer adapter missing. Other accessories like charger cable and charger adapter were in the case. Not happy but did not want to go through the process of a return.
excelent
"Arrived on time, came in sealed box, looked new an outside. I wish I could see an inside. Samsung Manufacturer/assembly in Vietnam. Works fine with T-Mobile. I will try on others carriers."
DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!! THEY ARE SELLING FAKE GALAXY S7 EDGES!!!! The box will be opened and not sealed. When the phone is on you will notice that there is a black line around the screen that should also not be there. Those are two dead giveaways that this is a cheap Chinese fake.
Thanks all is perfect
"Everything perfect, I recomend!"
I was a little hesitant that this phone wasn't going to be what I ordered but I was wrong. The first time opening the box was truly amazing I tried the phone out for two week and I'm loving the phone. Everything works fast and I'm very happy that I got it in the white version. The only problem for me was delivery but it is not the fault of the seller. I would've liked it if the left it on my porch because I had to drive and get it from the nearest ups store. Overall the best smartphone of 2016 I don't care what anybody says.
Love this.
Before buying refurbished phone from seller MASTERTRONICS. I had asked if it was compatible with my provider and if it had large scratches. He assured me full compatibility and no scratches. I have to say he was right phone works perfectly and have not one scratch I would definitely recommend this seller I will definitely purchase from seller again thank you for this amazing buy it could not ask for more.
Matt every expectation shipped quickly got here well and was easy to set up
"I bought the white version of the Samsung S7 edge and it is a amazing and gorgeous phone. It was really difficult to find it because it's not available for the US but it totally worth the trouble. I got the italian edition of it and it works nice and smooth with my Mexican SIM card, it doesn't has any preloaded content which is great and the preinstalled apps are the same as the US version. The only ""issue"" might be that the power connector of the charger is European, but the seller solved it in a great way by including an American adapter. I love my new phone and the whole experience was excellent with this seller.I used to be an iPhone lover, but Samsung did a great jog with this one and I'm perfectly happy of having taked the risk. Totally recommended!"
Works fantastic. Arrived on time. Thanks for a great product and purchasing experience.
